OCTOBER 31, 1838. --Spent in going to Mount Vernon on way

to Kenyon College.

November 1.-- Arrived at Gambier; looks as I expected.

November 3.--I was examined for the freshman class by

Messrs. Kendrick, Menscher, Smith, and Wing. Passed without

any trouble.  My teachers are Messrs. Sandels and Ufford.

November 6.--Recited for the first time.  The lessons are

not hard, about the right length.

November 27.--Went skating for the first time and broke

through the thin ice where the water was eight feet deep; was

not scared much. My companions helped me out without much

trouble. I could have got up without any help.

December 21.--[At] 4 o'clock A. M., started for home on

foot in company with Lamb, Comstock, and Calhoun. I arrived

at Delaware, forty miles, having been on the road about twelve

hours. I was not much fatigued. Spent a week very pleasantly.

December 28.--Started back alone on foot.  Staid at Mr.

Calhoun's over night. Started in the morning at 5 o'clock. It

was very stormy and the snow was three or four inches deep.

Arrived at Gambier at 4 o'clock, rather tired and lame.

January 1, 1839.-- We had recitations as usual but [I] did not

study any as I thought I would begin the New Year happily if

not profitably. I spent in the Christmas holidays but seventy-five

cents, my journey included.

January 18.-- This evening one of my friends had some eggs

and was about making some custard in his room in company with

three others. The tutor came to the door [and] knocked. M--

went and unfastened it. In the meantime the others had hid,

one under the bed and the others in the closet. The tutor found

them and sent them to their rooms, feeling rather sheepish. He

then jawed M-- and cleared out.

                           GAMBIER, OHIO, February 5, 1839.

  DEAR SISTER:-- Seein' as 'ow I've not written a letter to you

entirely since I've been here, I'll do it now. (An excellent reason

for so doing).   Now I'll tell you the snaps there have been of

late in this province.  As long as "his supreme highness," Rev.

William Sparrow, Vice-President of Kenyon College, a true son

of Erin, keeps away, so long all things here go along pleasantly;

but as soon as he begins to exercise his "justice," then comes

trouble.  As soon as he got back, in the chapel after prayers, he

said: "Young gentlemen, you will stop a very short time while

I make a very few remarks." He then talked about an hour, all

very good considering who it came from, and ended by saying,

"You will come to me after this to render all excuses!" Ho!

ho! how kind!  I have not been obliged to be excused yet for

anything and shan't  if I can help it while old S. is the law

and prophet. Among his few remarks he said: "I do think

if any one is despicable it is a hypocrite."  Most of us at that

time "smiled gently like a wolf."    Ho, ho!

  In the Grammar School the faculty "in their wisdom" con-

cluded they would oblige the scholars to call the roll themselves

and in this way save the expense of hiring it done.     They all

called it in their turns, like a set of fools, till it came the turn

of a young man by the name of Harrison, but when the roll was

given to him, he put it in his pocket and did not call it. The

next day the Principal told him to go out of the room.        He

went out.  Some of the other scholars looking rather mutinous,

the old Principal got up and made a flaming speech telling them,

"this is a monarchial form of government; and the power of

commanding is fixed here," at the same time striking his breast

an awful blow.

  And what did the honorable faculty do upon this? Why,

went and said that the Principal of the Grammar School had

done his duty and that Mr. Harrison should beg his pardon or

leave the institution.  An excellent alternative.   As a matter

of course Mr. H. chose to leave but was obliged to wait till he

could get money from home. A day or two ago old Sparrow

met him and told him [if] he did not leave the hill in eight

hours he would give him a public dismissal.  And "Mr. Sparrow









             <B>AT KENYON COLLEGE, 1838-1840          29</B>



is a very kind, affectionate man; he'll do just right." A petition

was got up for the purpose of trying to turn the faculty's decree,

and every student in college signed it except one and he is a

"Marylander from old Frederick," same as old Sharpe & Co.

Mr. H. is now in [Mount] Vernon; the faculty have not yet acted

on the petition.

  "Resist tyranny in every shape," is my motto, "but in none

[is it] so dangerous as when exercised by a number of tyrants."

This latter clause suits the faculty of Kenyon College.      They

give a student a fair trial, they say, but do not allow him to say

a thing for himself. This is a "fair trial" truly.

  As to going to Hudson College: I may possibly agree to go

there when I am turned away from this, provided they wish me

to go there very much. The same will apply to all the colleges

in the world except Yale and Georgetown, Kentucky.         That's

my honest opinion on colleges.     Mother wants me to like my

teachers.  Well, I do like them--a great ways off.  She says

I must not think my teachers are partial.  Well, I don't think

they are.  I know so; and do believe they are partial to me-

for one.   Mother told me to begin a letter on receipt of hers.

I did so, and then burnt it.  She says I must be careful of my

health. Well, I is careful. She also says I must dry my clean

clothes by the fire.  Well, if I did that I should put none on.

As to our friends over to the Hall, H. Howard does not like

Mr. Dyer much, but Mr. D. likes him quite well. S. and E.

Hinton neither like Mr. D. nor he them.

  I see you are so much obliged to me for five words that you

cannot express it, and now, of course, you'll be so much obliged

to me that you'll sneeze, gap [gape], and other omens of the

kind. Don't congratulate yourself too much about my making

short sermons when I am a preacher.        If you had seen some

documents that proceeded from my pen, you'd be congratulating

yourself on the idea of what a long time you'd have to sleep in

sermons.   I must say something about gaping.       You need not

try to save any for me, for if you do your mouth will be open

all the time. . .

  Please send me a half dozen "Downfalls of Babylon" to cover

books with.  If you don't get a Journal and Register once in a









<B>30           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



while, just lay it to Amos Kendall [Postmaster General], for I

start one from here every month and rainy days oftener.

And so Miss F. A. Hayes wishes R. B. Hayes to like his

teachers. You better get Uncle, Mr. Wasson, and all others

concerned to write to me to like my teachers.

I went into the college library for the first time and there saw

books some of which [looked] as if printed when Methuselah's

grandmother was a babe, and others so large they'd weigh fifty

pounds.   I shall give you a list of the books I saw there that

you should by all means procure and read forthwith: viz.:

Bibles in the following languages, German, Irish, Welsh, Hebrew,

Spanish, Italian, Gaelic, Danish, Malay, Carshun and Syric,

Turkish, Chaldee, Singhalese, Georgian, Kythee, Nugee, and last,

not least, the English, all of which were 'most twice as large as

Mr. Vandeman's.

  The dreaded examination comes on in six weeks and I verily

fear that about a dozen of us will have to study in vacation. The

beloved vacation is in six weeks from next Wednesday and is

changed to three weeks long.  Good.     In my next letter I shall

give you an account of how I spent my money and also that I

want forty dollars which is fifteen or twenty more than I want

next term.

                  Your affectionate brother,

                               R. B. HAYES, ESQ.,

                      No. 13, West Division, Kenyon College.

Miss F. A. HAYES,

 Delaware, Ohio.

                           GAMBIER, OHIO, March 10, 1839.

   DEAR MOTHER:--I am about to try to write an answer to

your and F.'s "bone" letter; "bone" 'cause it had forty dollars

in it. When I get home so as to talk it over I think I can con-

vince you about the "dismissions" being unjust, but I am too

lazy to write enough for that. There has been a very smart

young man dismissed from the junior class since I wrote last,

and I think unjustly. But as I don't expect to be dismissed, I

shall drop this subject. You said Uncle said "I must not walk









             <B>AT KENYON COLLEGE, 1838-1840          31</B>



home in a day."  Well, it is immaterial.  I'd as soon be a minute

or two over a day as under. But what pleased me particularly

was your saying I must "bring my clothes home," as if I would

forget to wear any. You say I missed seeing many friends by

not being home, but if I had not been here I should not have

seen some of my  friends, for instance Mr. Sparrow or Mr.

Dyer, etc. Uncle will get a letter at the end of the session from

old Sparrow and I reckon it will say I am a tolerable good boy,

considering my birthplace. I am afraid I will not write to

Uncle this term. But the gun story took my eye. Edgar Hinton

came over here the day I got your letter and I told him his gun

had burst and 'most killed his father.  He said, "Why, the gun

ain't spoiled is it? He might have known he could not load it."

That's good! ha! ha! whew!  Now I will account for my money.

You recollect I gave you an account of all except what I got

Christmas and five dollars which I then had left. It has gone for



     Wood ............................................    $2 00

     Society expenses ................................     9 00

     Sugar and my expense coming back ................     1 00

     Tuition in oratory ..............................     1 50

     Paper, stationery, etc ..........................     1 00

     Postage on paper and letters ....................     1 00

     Portfolio .......................................     1 25

     Gallon of oil  ..................................     1 00

     Algebra .........................................     1 50

     Slate ...........................................       25

     2 Mending shoes .................................     1 00

     Supper at Cake Shop .............................       25

        Total ............... ........................   $20 75

     Left in treasury $4.25.  Plus $40 equals $44.25.



  Of the $44.25 which I now have, I must pay $2.00 for wash-

ing, $34.75 for board, and $2.00 which I owe to Mr. Jones in

Mount Vernon. My debts are in all $38.75. So you see my ex-

penses this session, buying furniture and all, will be 'most $1oo.

This includes travelling expenses, etc.

  We shall study none after Wednesday.  Then comes examina-

tion and I am rather dubious whether I shall pass or not. I









<B>32           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



rather think I shall. If I don't, I shall just bring a book or two

home to study rainy days.

                   I am your affectionate son,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



  DEAR F--:--I admire your story of the crackers very much

for they are eatables. If R. Moody had been cunning he would

have given me that gun. I rather fear we will not use it much.

You say your risibles were excited by my letter. I s'pose that is

some new-fashioned cape or bonnet, but I must say I don't see

what there was in my letter to make your capes or bonnets shake

about; but no odds, I don't doubt your word tho. But I hope

you will not say I cut your letter in pieces without good author-

ity, for I have neither cut up or burned one of your letters or

otherwise mutilated them. So, now! I am glad you have trav-

elled so much, but you will read no more of Dr. Fiske's travels

for he is dead. He died two weeks ago. You ask me if we shall

have time to go to Lower Sandusky this spring. I think we

will, for if we went but two miles a day we would get there be-

fore the end of spring. I don't think we would have time for

much of a visit but still I should like very well to go. I suppose

your six-feet girls were measured with a pole where the feet

were not more than nine inches long, but they should be tall, for

the Mansion House is a tall house.

  I am astonished at your cruelty in preferring quills to steel

pens, for in using a steel pen you are assisting thousands of poor

souls to gain their bread, viz., ironmongers, miners, blacksmiths,

etc., who gain their living by making steel pens; but on the

other hand you would reflect upon the pain of Madame Goose

and Mr. Gander in having their feathers plucked out by the

roots. Oh! it is horrid to think on, tho I am now using quills

myself.

  I hope to be home if nothing happens on Saturday the 23d of

March. I don't know whether I shall write any more or not.

               I remain your affectionate brother,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MISS F. A. HAYES.









             <B>AT KENYON COLLEGE, 1838-1840          33</B>



                             GAMBIER, OHIO, May 13, 1839.

  DEAR F--:-- I received yours and Mother's letter some time

ago and ought [to] have answered it before now. John's death

was hard news for me. When I heard of his death I did not

know that Mr. W -- [Wasson] had got home from Pennsylvania,

and bad as it was I could not help thinking what bad news it

would be to Mr. W--.

  The student who saw Mr. W- said he had a niece with him

whom he had brought from Pennsylvania. You say nothing of it.

  I do not doubt that H. P. -- can beat me at chess. I have

played but once since I wrote to you before. Playing ball is all

the fashion here now and it is presumed that I can beat you at

that if not at chess. There is to be at Kenyon College (which,

by the way, is not far from this place) a grand celebration by the

students on the Fourth of July 1839, and if nothing happens it

will be a tall affair. I do not know as ladies will partake of the

dinner, but if they do I'll give you an invitation in due season.

We shall undoubtedly have better speeches, if not eatables, than

at Delaware, Ohio.

  Now that this place is beginning to look like spring, I do not

wonder that Mrs. Little thought it beautiful. I hope to see you

here this summer sometime.

                         Your brother,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MIss FANNY HAYES.



  DEAR MOTHER:-- In your letter you show some fear that I do

not write enough, but you need not fear, for this season we are

compelled to write compositions of some kind or other at the

rate of about three in two weeks; and as for improving in pen-

manship, I have given that up long since. I do not wish to

go to Yale College but I think I shall remain here, though I

think Hudson College is as good, if not better than this one is;

and I have no doubt it soon will be much better than any other

in the West anywhere.

  I was sorry to hear that H. Moody is not to be married in

Delaware, as I should very much like to go to the wedding.

  My bill here this session will not be so much as it was last by

    3









<B>34           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



fifteen [or] twenty dollars, I think. The beginning of the session

the studies were tolerable hard, but now I can get my lessons

very easily.

  As for writing long letters, I cannot do it when I have nothing

in the world to write about.

  I have not been absent from recitation or any other duty this

session. We get up at five o'clock and have about two hours of

playtime before nine o'clock; and as a matter of course if we

have more playtime, I like the summer term the best.

                    I remain your affectionate son,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--I am thankful to you for sending papers. I've just

received the New Orleans Picayune and Express.-- R. B.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                              GAMBIER, OHIO, July 9, 1839.

   [DEAR F--] :-- I received the letter of Mrs. Hayes and Daugh-

ter in good health after a long but pleasant voyage of four days.

The only news here now is, the big monkey is dead and pussy

has got the hydr- I forget the rest of the word. As there

is nothing else to write of I shall attempt to give you a history

of our celebration of the Fourth of July, 1839. At 4 o'clock A.

M., the flags were hoisted--one on a pole by the chapel, the

others on the college, the band playing their prettiest in the mean-

time. We then went to prayers and thence unto a little the

poorest breakfast you ever saw. Time then flew as it were upon

snail's wings till half past 10 o'clock A. M., when after a great

deal of trouble Marshalls Lane and Comstock succeeded in get-

ting us in order. We marched into the chapel to the sound of

martial music. A prayer by the chaplain, Bishop McIlvaine [ex

officio President of the college], the Declaration of Independence

by Reader Gibbs, and very good oration by Orator Lightner.

We marched to Mr. Sawyer's, who is no more nor less than Eng-

lish Jimmy who used to live in Delaware, where we had the best

dinner I ever saw; and every one of the faculty and all the

rest said it was the best they ever saw. The first course, there

was beef, veal, pig, bacon, mutton, chickens, turkeys, peas, beans,









             <B>AT KENYON COLLEGE, 1838-1840          35</B>



new taters, new turnips, plum pudding, bread, butter, water, and

other articles too numerous to mention.

  Second course: twenty-nine kinds of cake more or less as

the case may be. There were eight kinds of cake I never saw

before; seven kinds I did not know nor never heard the names of.

  Third course: lemonade to drink toasts in and ice cream.

  There were lots of toasts given, a copy of which I hope to send.

We then marched to the chapel and heard about a dozen speeches

from different students. By this time it was 'most dark. We

went home and I went to bed after having spent the happiest

day I ever spent without exception. I believe there is not a

student but thinks we had the most happiness here of any place

in the United States. An ode was read at the table by Mr. Taylon

a member of our class. It was excellent and Dr. Sparrow was

so much pleased with it that his toast on the occasion was "The

Poet of the Occasion." Something of an honor to be toasted by

such a man as the Doctor! I will send you a copy [of the ode]

if it is printed, as I believe it is to be.

  Mr. Calhoun was at your celebration at Delaware. He praised

the generosity of you folks very much. He thought it a grand

celebration; but I think I had rather have been here. We have

commenced reviewing in all our studies, preparing for examin-

ation. If I pass, in five weeks I will be a sophomore. Com-

mencement, there will probably be more here than ever before.

The class that graduates is a very smart one.  The orator of the

Fourth and [the] reader are the smartest.

  You in your letters quote Shakespeare more than Scripter and

I expect you read it more. However, an old stiff Presbyterian

reverend in Vermont says Shakespeare is an exposition of

Scripter.

  Give my respects to the Husted family and all other cousins.

I know how to sympathize with you for having no knife as I have

had none this session. I hope to come next session with a larger

supply of everything than I did this. I hope you will have

peas or squashes, as the case may be, when I come to visit you.

  Good-bye.-- "Consider me as one of your very best friends."

-Milton.                               RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  Henry Clay is at [Mount] Vernon. I hope to see him.









<B>36           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  DEAR MOTHER:-- Your letter was very acceptable. I was glad

to hear that Uncle had found so good a friend. I hope he will

soon be well. Do not make me more than one or two shirts now.

Make them the same as my others, except much larger cuffs

and necks, as my others choke me rather much. My clothes are

not shabby but I have not enough. If it continues warm, I shall

be obliged to get a pair of pantaloons. I can get thin clothes here

much better than at home. I can get a "decent" pair for two

dollars and fifty cents. If it is not hot long I shall not get them.

My expenses here this term are more than I expected. For my

first year here the expense will be one hundred and eighty-nine

dollars. I never will or can get along as cheap again. The

term so far at least has been to me very pleasant. One of

the very worst and most profane fellows in college have been con-

verted by Dr. Sparrow's lectures and it was truly a great change.

  I remain this time your affectionate son (not brother),

                                               R. B. HAYES.

Indian chief who lived in the time of Caesar and ruled over Den-

mark, by name Mr. Col Wyconneechechechochuchekirmpanathe-

nothen.

                                    GAMBIER, August, 1839.

  DEAR MOTHER:--Your letter was received in due season and

I hope hospitably. You appear to have been in part of your

letter rather desponding and partly in fine spirits. I am very

sorry Uncle's health does not improve. As you left Fanny the

"task" of telling the story of her "thraldom," I will give her the

task of reading my opinion of it.

  The revival I spoke of in a former letter is now the all-

engrossing subject here. There are now but ten in the whole

college who are not changed. I am among the ten as yet, tho

I have changed my opinions of persons and things a great

deal. I have changed my opinion of Mr. Sparrow and Mr.

Stevenson. It now appears to me that it was a hard necessity

which compelled them to act "tyrannically."









             <B>AT KENYON COLLEGE, 1838-1840          37</B>



  Every single one of my best friends are "gone," as it is called.

I attend the meetings and read all the books that my friends

request me to, but I find it is the loss of my friends which affects

me more than anything else. When the revival began to take the

"good" fellows as well as the "bad," I was frequently in company

with five or six others, of whom I was the only one who would

"acknowledge" my respect for religion, who are all "gone" but

myself.  I have but little hope I shall be among them. If I am not,

I fear I can never spend as happy a time in Kenyon as I have.

I know now the truth of the saying, "a person knows not the

value of a friend 'til he is lost," although I know my old friends

are better friends than those [of] "that line." All the Nor-

walkers and Lamb are, I believe, among them.

  Dear me, what a fuss, but I forgot I was to write to Fan about

the [engagement] instead of you.

  I shall need twenty dollars more. I wish twenty-five dollars

and hope you will send the latter as I should like to buy a book or

two so that if I wish to stay a little longer than vacation I can

study some.

                   I remain your affectionate son,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

                                      GAMBIER, May 4, 1840.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I am again comfortably settled at my

studies.  I am glad I came no sooner than I did for but few

came before me. There are not near as many here as there was

last session; but twelve in my class. The two best scholars are

gone. Dr. Sparrow leaves for good at the end of the session,

and several more of my class leave at the same time; there will

not be more than five left.

  A three-dollar bill I took from Chauncey H--, I found at

Columbus to be counterfeit. I sent it back by Mr. Bunker. By

the by, I had a pleasant time at Columbus. I was much pleased

with William's<B>*</B> plan of fixing his house. I shall spend my vaca-

tion very pleasantly there, I should think.    Mr. Hinton's boys

are very well pleased indeed.     The teachers are fine men and

<B>38           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



above all I believe they keep the house clean; the Grammar

School is also much improved, but here it stops. The improve-

ment in the college department is on the wrong side of the

face. Harry Howard came back last week. I shall get thin

clothes as I want them.     I am out of the line so I will not

attempt to strive against fate but stop short.  If all leave who

now think they will, I leave with them.

                              Your son,

  P. S.--Tell F. I found Ossian's poems in both libraries.      I

have them out now.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                             GAMBIER, OHIO, July 19, 1840.

  DEAR SISTER:-- I can but look back with "fear and trembling"

upon my folly in writing a letter characterized by such a fool-

hardy disregard of consequences as was my last; for among the

first lessons taught me in my childhood was to shun everything

like an attempt to startle or frighten a fellow-being for the sake

of a moment's fun or a senseless laugh. Yet forgetting or dis-

regarding this oft-repeated warning, I, as if goaded on by a

demon, concocted, reduced to writing, and mailed to you a letter

of three pages' length.   "My tongue cleaves to the roof of my

mouth," my knees knock together, and my hands refuse to per-

form their office when a glimmering of the jeopardy in which

your reason and life was placed by that letter crosses my brain.

Thanks to the soundness of your education, the strength of your

intellect, and the firmness of your soul, you are saved; and be-

lieve me when I say that never, never, never again shall I run

such immanent hazard of blighting forever all the happiness

which our family now enjoys by writing a letter of such un-

usual length.

  You and your little band of emigrants have by this time settled

a colony in the northern part of that heathenish city, "about

equally distant from the penitentiary, graveyard, rope-walk,

and  slaughter-house.   Very  appropriate."     Ha!  ha!    That

is a good joke on the Van Buren men.

  Now, as I am remarkably well versed in the history of the

ancient republics and well acquainted with the principles upon

which a government should be framed, a little salutary advice

will not be out of place.  It is a fact well attested by the his-

tory of every new country, that whatever fraud or injustice is

committed by colonists upon the aborigines of a country, is

always reflected back upon the heads of those who commit [it],

and that by a kind and conciliating manner toward the natives

nothing is lost but often very much gained.    My advice, there-

fore, is that [in] all your acts, both public and private, you

continually keep this grand truth before your mind. Conducting

yourself in this way, you may confidently and reasonably expect

that your colony will become a great and wise people and be

loved and esteemed by your friends and respected and admired

by your enemies, and that, unlike all things else of human

origin, your nation will never fall but go on "conquering and to

conquer" till the end of time.

                         MISCELLANY.

  Commencement is on Wednesday, the 5th of August.

  We had a fine time on the Fourth.

  Eight students got into a snap and were put on probation, two

of them professors of religion. One had to read a confession to

escape dismission.

  Mrs. Hayes is expected here the first of next month. Mr. and

and Mrs. Platt also.

  Money is scarce and much needed, as the bankrupt law is de-

feated in the H. R. [House of Representatives].

  By the end of the session R. B. H. must have thirty-five dol-

lars. One installment of which is expected and needed in his

next letter from home.

  The mail will be closed in ten minutes.

  A letter is requested immediately.

  Ten more words is wanted to fill out this column.

  Mother wishes me to keep my hair, "teeth," and nails cut short.

                        Your brother,  R. BIRCHARD HAYES.

  Give my respects to the family.

  MRS. WM. A. PLATT.

  [The Presidential campaign of 1840 was one of the most ex-

citing and interesting political contests in American history.

Never before had the people generally been so stirred. The

Whigs early took the initiative. They held everywhere enormous

meetings with singing, shouting, cheering processions of en-

thusiastic partisans.  The campaign roused the ardor of young

Hayes, who was an earnest Whig, and made a deep and lasting

impression on his mind. He followed it throughout with in-

tense interest and was jubilant at the overwhelming Whig

triumph. This is manifest in the following brief history of the

campaign which he wrote during its progress. It reveals such

constraint and maturity that it is difficult to realize that it is the

composition of a lad just completing his eighteenth year.]



     A HISTORY OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1840.

                    BEGUN JUNE 25, 1840.

  In order to give a full and complete history of this campaign,

it is necessary to go back to and examine the situation of the

country, the policy pursued, and the measures which Mr. Van

Buren was pledged to carry out when elected in 1836.

  By the influence of General Jackson in 1834 the state bank

system was substituted for the National Bank as the depository

of the public moneys.

  The "Pet Bank System" during the remainder of General

Jackson's Administration apparently succeeded in accomplishing

its object; and when he delivered his last message our affairs

were in so prosperous a condition that he said with truth: "I

leave the nation in prosperity and at peace with all nations."

  Mr. Van Buren in his inaugural address, March 4, 1837, said:

"I shall follow in the footsteps of my illustrious predecessor";

an assurance which he has since found very hard [to] fulfill.

  In May following, all the evils of the "Pet Bank System" burst

upon the country.  The banks were compelled to "suspend," and

the commercial cities were filled with distress and ruin. An

extra session of Congress was called. Mr. Van Buren recom-

mended the sub-treasury scheme, the object of which was to

separate the Government from the banks and reduce our cur-

rency to specie. Many of the heretofore members of the Van

Buren party refused to support the measure. They called them-

selves Conservatives. Mr. Rives, Tallmadge, Ruggles, and sev-

eral members of the House of Representatives were among the

principal. The measure was rejected by a close vote.

  The fall elections turned upon this point. The party opposed to

Van Buren succeeded beyond all expectation. New York went

against him by a large majority. But in his first annual message

to the Congress of 1837-8, he again recommended the measure,

and it became evident that the Administration were determined

to "sink or swim" with the scheme. Mr. Van Buren said, al-

luding to the result of the fall elections: "The sober second

thought of the people is seldom wrong and always efficient."

The measure was again rejected.  A caucus was held by the op-

position members of Congress who recommended that a con-

vention to nominate candidates for President and Vice-President

be held at Harrisburg, December, 1839. Although this was later

than many wished, yet, as it was recommended by the best

"managers" in the land, it was agreed to by the party.

  In the fall elections of 1838, the Van Buren party were suc-

cessful. Ohio, Indiana, and Tennessee, all returned Democratic

members, but New York still remained firm; so that the opposi-

tion were still in good spirits. In the session of 1838-39, the

Sub-Treasury was again put down.  In the fall elections of 1839,

the Democratic party were very successful and the Whig party

were low-spirited.

  But the pressure of the times began to be felt all over the

Union. The farmers and laboring classes, who before had not

suffered, now were the most oppressed.

  The Twenty-sixth Congress, after several weeks of trouble

about contested seats, was organized and the administration

party with the aid of the New Jersey members had a decided

majority.

  The Whigs now began to hope that with a popular candidate

they could by great exertion succeed. Many thought the Van

Buren party had not fulfilled their promises and expressed their

dissatisfaction with the Administration.

  In December, 1839, "the Convention" met.  It was composed









<B>42           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>

of one delegate from each Congressional District. Nearly all the

States were represented by the principal men in the nation.

Governor Barbour, of Virginia, presided. The candidates for

nomination were Clay, Scott, and Harrison. There was a spirit

of concession manifest from the beginning which showed they

[the delegates] were determined.

  Harrison was nominated.  The convention were all well satis-

fied.  Everywhere the nomination was hailed with joy by the

opposers of the Administration. Large and enthusiastic meetings

were held in the different States to respond to the nomination.

  John Tyler, of Virginia, was nominated for Vice-President

unanimously.  General Scott, Mr. Clay, Webster, Tallmadge,

Rives, Generals Clinch, Gaines, and Van Rensselaer, all expressed

their determination to go heart and hand for the nominations.

  In this State (Ohio), many who had before been supporters

of Van Buren came out publicly and declared their intention to

go for Harrison. About this time the Baltimore Republican,

a Van Buren print, sneeringly said of General Harrison: "Give

him a pension of two thousand dollars and a barrel of hard cider,

and he will be content to live in a log cabin the remainder of his

days." Great use was made of this by the Harrison party. They

styled themselves the "Log-cabin and hard-cider party."  In

February and March, 1840, log cabins began to be built for

council houses for the Harrison party.

  A convention was held on the 22d of February in this State

(Columbus) to respond to the nomination and nominate candi-

dates for state offices. Large and spirited meetings were held in

the different counties nominating delegates for "the Convention."

All knew that the State was aroused, but as the weather was bad,

the roads almost impassable, few expected that there would be

much of a "turnout"; but the day came, and with it the greatest

[meeting] in many respects ever held. There was no plan or

system, but each delegation bore as their emblem whatever their

caprice dictated. Log cabins, hard cider, canoes, boats, all kinds,

were brought with thousands of mottoes.

  At this convention it was, that political songs were sung to

any great extent, and this was the first of that series of great

conventions for which this campaign will be remarkable. Num-

ber present twenty thousand. A convention was held in Con-

necticut, remarkable for its size,--five thousand.

  The first contested state election after the nomination was in

Connecticut. To this election the eyes of both parties were

turned. Both claimed it and both knew it would test the popular-

ity of the Harrisburg nominees. The result was a clear Harrison

majority of four thousand five hundred.  Rhode Island was also

claimed by both parties. Harrison's majority, one thousand

four hundred.

  But again the eyes of both parties were directed to [the] Vir-

ginia election. Two senators were to be elected by the next

Legislature. Two Van Buren and two Harrison men were up.

The Van Buren party hoped that the nomination would be un-

popular in the South; but the result showed a Harrison majority

of ten on joint ballot. The township and charter elections were

claimed by both parties as evidences of their strength.

  Tremendous conventions began to be held in the summer by

the Harrison party.  [On the] 11th [of] June, Fort Meigs,

thirty-five thousand. Tippecanoe, thirty thousand. Illinois, June

4, fifteen thousand.  Both parties are straining every nerve.

Now my belief is that the Harrison party will succeed.-- June

30, 1840.

  July 30. -- The election in Louisiana came off on the 6th. The

result was looked to with great interest as indicative of the state

of feeling existing in the extreme South.  It resulted in the

triumph of the Harrison party.

  August.--The battle waxes hotter; the Administration begin

to hope for success in the elections in Kentucky, Iowa, Illinois,

Mississippi, Alabama, and North Carolina. But they are doomed

to be disappointed: the Harrisonians have carried the three large

States.

  September.--The Van Buren party, grown desperate by de-

feat, now begin to hope for the result in Maine and Vermont.

They are beaten in both States.

  October.--They know that nothing but success in this State

can save them.  They are accordingly straining every nerve.

Johnson, Allen, Shannon, etc., are stumping it over the State,

Mr. Corwin has also been before the people.









<B>44           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  October 13.--Election day.  The Whigs have carried the

States of Georgia, Maryland, and Delaware. In fine spirits here

I believe Mr. Corwin will be elected by fifteen thousand.

  October 20.--Returns all in. Corwin, Governor, by seventeen

thousand five hundred!!!

  October 25.--The result in Pennsylvania is doubtful. I think

the Whigs will carry it on the 30th by eight thousand. And in

this State by twenty-five thousand.

  November 5.--The long agony is over. The "whirlwind" has

swept over the land and General Harrison is undoubtedly elected

President. I never was more elated by anything in my life. His

majority in this State about sixteen acres, or twenty-three thou-

sand. Kentucky and everywhere else is going fine. Glorious!

  Up on the Reserve "Birney [James G. Birney, candidate for

President of the "Liberty Party"] and Van Buren run about

alike." Ha! ha!
