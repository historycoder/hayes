             <B>BOYHOOD  VISIT TO NEW ENGLAND</B>

  THE earliest extant writing of Rutherford B. Hayes is a nar-

ative, written in his twelfth year, giving an account of a

visit made in company with his mother and sister to relatives in

New England. This was in the summer of 1834. The journey

was made by stage, steamboat, and canal boat, with one short rail-

way ride. The journal is in a small paper-covered notebook.

The penmanship is reasonably plain and clean, the spelling for

the most part accurate, though there are numerous slips especially

in proper names, but there is little punctuation and much ir-

regularity in the use of capitals. The narrative follows.]

  We left home, Delaware, Wednesday, June 1834; arrived

at Lower Sandusky [now Fremont] the same evening. We

stayed with Uncle Birchard till the 8th; then went down the

Sandusky River to Portland [now Sandusky]. Monday evening

went on board the Henry Clay. Had a pleasant passage down

Lake Erie to Buffalo. We went on board a canal boat Wednes-

day morning. Arrived at Schenectady Monday morning. Then

went on the railroad to Saratoga. Visited the springs and my

Grandfather Birchard's grave.

  Tuesday, came in the stage to Bennington. Wednesday, came

to Wilmington. Thursday, arrived at my Grandfather Hayes',

in Brattleboro. We spent a week in this pleasant village. We

spent two weeks in the pleasant village of Fayetteville [now

Newfane], at my Uncle Austin Birchard's. From there we went

over the Brookline mountain to Putney where I had lots of fun

with George breaking up bumblebees' nests. We went from

                         <B>(1)</B>









<B>2            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Uncle Noyes' to Chesterfield in New Hampshire.  Had a pleasant

visit at Mr. Mead's. Had a fine sail on the pond. Came through

Westmoreland then to Putney; from there to Dummerston. Had

a pleasant visit at my Uncle Roger Birchard's.

  We visited many other towns in the State of Vermont. Then

to Massachusetts, through Northfield, Montague, Sunderland,

and Amherst.  The college and Mount Pleasant School at Am-

herst are most beautiful.  We then spent a week in Granby at

my Uncles Robbins' and Smith's.

  We then started for Chesterfield [Massachusetts]. Went to

the summit of Mt. Holyoke. The scene was most delightful.

The windings of the beautiful Connecticut, together with the

beautiful villages of Northampton, Hadley, Amherst, and Granby

below us, presented a scene such as I never beheld before. We

then went through the beautiful village of Northampton. The

Crowned Hill School at this place is beautifully situated, with

trees back of it--which presents a fine appearance. We ar-

rived at Chesterfield the same evening.

  We staid [at] Uncle Bancroft's about a week. We had a

very pleasant visit. We then went through Williamsburg,

Whately, Deerfield, Greenfield, and Guilford, and arrived at

Brattleboro the same evening.

  I then went to Dummerston; then went to Putney. Staid there

an hour, then went to Fayetteville [Newfane] with my Uncle

Roger. Staid there three days at my Uncle Austin's -- court

week. Went several times to Brattleboro. Went up to my

grandfather's with Horatio N[oyes].  Staid there over night.

Then went to Putney to my Uncle N's [Noyes's], where we are

staying now.

  Mr. Trowbridge, his wife, and sister from New Haven spent

a day at Uncle Noyes'. Mr. Mead and his family came over

from Chesterfield to Uncle N's. We then went to Dummerston

where we are now, September 25.

  We then [on] September 27 went to Brattleboro. I went to

meeting; heard Mr. Stark preach. I then went down to the

east village to my Uncle William's. With H. N. [Horatio Noyes]

we went down to the river. We sent Fanny in after sticks. We

then put a board across the brook; we then climbed up the rocks









             <B>BOYHOOD - VISIT TO NEW ENGLAND          3</B>



and went down to where the river run in a very narrow place

and so swift [boats] could not get up; so they fixed a large log

with a long rope tied to it, so that by tying it [the rope] to the

boat [and] by turning the log it will pull the boat up. We then

went down to the furnace and saw all the moulds for making

stoves, kettles, boilers, and every kind [of] iron ware. We then

went to the steam sawmill and saw them drag a log up by steam.

  I staid at Uncle W's [William's] over night. H. N. went to

New Haven in the morning. It rained today and I stayed in the

house and Aunt Hayes and Jane T- made some candy and I

had sport enough a-pulling it. The next day I went down to

Uncle Elliot's. Took dinner there. In the afternoon Uncle,

Aunt, and Jane came there to tea. Samuel Elliot and I went

to the paper-mill and saw a great many new things. I then

[went] up to my grandfather's.

  The next day Uncle W. and Aunt Hayes, Uncle Elliot, Belinda,

and Jane came up to tea. Saturday Grandfather and John

Pease carried us to Wilmington. Staid over Sunday at Mr.

Rugg's.

  Start Monday the 6th of October for home. Mr. Rugg carried

us to the tavern where we took the stage. Went across the

mountain. Could see snow on an opposite mountain. Arrived

at Bennington at noon; took dinner there. Passed through Hoo-

soc [Hoosick] and Lancenburg [Lansingburg] and arrived at

Troy in the evening. In [the evening] I walked all over Troy.

It is a very beautiful city. Took the 7 o'clock stage for Schenec-

tady; arrived there at ten. Took a canal boat. Nothing im-

portant till Little Falls. There is scarcely a place on the canal.

  [Hayes's sister, Frances Arabella Hayes, (always called

Fanny), was born at Delaware, Ohio, January 25, 1820. She

was educated at a seminary at Putnam, Ohio, being valedictorian

of her class at graduation. She was married, September 2, 1839,

to William A. Platt, a prosperous business man of Columbus,

Ohio. She died July 16, 1856, leaving three daughters and one

son. Hayes, who had always been most devoted to her, mourned

her loss throughout his life. Soon after her death he wrote his

early recollections of her. This narrative is given here because

it abounds in interesting details of his boyhood life.]









<B>4            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  My sister Fanny Arabella Hayes was born at Delaware, Ohio,

January 25, 1820. The family then consisted of our father and

mother, Rutherford and Sophia Hayes; an older sister, Sophia;

an older brother, Lorenzo; Uncle Sardis, Mother's brother; and a

cousin of Mother's, Arcena Smith, afterwards Mrs. Wasson.

Sophia died before Fanny's recollection, in 182I, and Lorenzo

was drowned at the age of nine years while skating on the mill-

pond at Delaware in January, 1825. Fanny always retained a

very pleasant recollection of him. He was kind and good-

natured, prompt, energetic, and courageous, and the earliest pro-

tector of his little sister. Father died before Fanny was three

years old, on the 20th of July, 1822, of a fever. I was born a

few months afterwards. At the time of my first recollections,

our family consisted of Mother, Fanny, Uncle Sardis, Arcena

Smith, and myself. It is probable that Mr. Rheine and Mr.

Thomas Wasson (afterwards married to Arcena) were members

of the family, or lived with us as boarders soon after my father's

death. I recollect them both as far back as I remember any one.

During these early years Uncle was regarded as the stay of the

family and our protector and adviser in every trouble. He was

appointed guardian of Fanny and myself, and during all our

lives has been a father to us.

  We lived in a new two-story brick house on the northeast

corner of William and Winter Streets, opposite the old brick

Methodist meetinghouse in Delaware. It was building at the

time of Father's death and remained in part unfinished until

about 1828. Our garden, grass plot, and barnyard occupied, I

think, two village lots about twelve rods on William Street by

sixteen on Winter Street. We had two apple trees, six or eight

fine English cherry trees, several peach trees, a couple of quince,

and currant bushes in abundance. At the outer edge of the side-

walk, in front of the house on William Street, were planted a

number of locusts, which grew to a large size. The kitchen was

an old one-story frame building, fronting on Winter Street, ad-

joining the new house. About a year after Father's death we

moved into the new house, but our resources were so limited

that we got no new furniture and were rather scantily supplied.

A new bureau and stand, still to be seen in Mother's room at









             <B>BOYHOOD - EARLY RECOLLECTIONS          5</B>



Columbus, and plain wood-bottomed chairs, a gilt-framed look-

ing-glass, a good carpet, and cheap curtains furnished the parlor.

We were well provided with all that was necessary for comfort

and our red-brick house, built fronting on the street, was as

grand as the houses of our neighbors. I do not know that Fanny

or myself ever envied the condition or possessions of our friends,

except, perhaps, the picture and story books which Mr. Petti-

bone, the leading lawyer of the village, gave his children. And

after Uncle Birchard went into business we were well supplied

with everything of the sort by him.

  Mother's income was derived from the rent of a good farm

about ten miles north of town on the east side of the Whetstone.

We received as rent one-third of the crops and half of the fruit,

delivered at our barn and house in town.

  The great events of our childhood were connected with this

farm. We visited it three or four times a year, each trip occupy-

ing a whole day. Sugar-making, cider-making, cherry time, and

gathering hickory nuts and walnuts were the occasions of these

long looked for and delightful trips. Mother sometimes rode on

horseback, carrying one and sometimes both of us on the horse

behind her. Generally, however, we walked and crossed the river

a short distance below the farm in a canoe. The tenants always

were attentive to Fanny and myself. They gave us colored eggs

filled with sugar at Easter, pet birds, squirrels, rabbits, quail's

eggs, turtle's eggs, and other curious gifts easily found in the

country at that time.

  My earliest recollection of Fanny is as my protector and nurse

when I was a sickly, feeble boy, three or four years old. She

would lead me carefully about the garden and barnyard and on

short visits to the nearest neighbors. She was loving and kind

to me and very generous. With the grown persons in the family

she was at this time quick-tempered and obstinate. Uncle Bir-

chard, to tease her, would put her on the mantel-piece and tell her

she must stay there until she asked him to take her down. This

she would not do, but sitting perfectly upright to avoid falling,

her face flushed with anger, she would bid him defiance, and

rarely if ever gave up. She slept with Arcena and loved her

dearly. The first important incident of her life, which I recollect,









<B>6            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



was a long and severe illness in the summer of 1827. At one time

her life was despaired of, and for many weeks she was danger-

ously sick. After the disease (dysentery) left her, she was a long

time regaining her strength. It was in the summer during the

warmest weather. After she was able to sit up, I daily gave her

little rides upon a small hand-sled which with great difficulty I

hauled about the garden. We were both very happy. I can re-

member no happier days in childhood than these. Fanny was

very grateful and appeared so glad that I could be happy spend-

ing the days with her. We have often spoken of it in later years

and recurred to that period as the beginning of the warm attach-

ment which has lasted during life. While she was recovering she

had a wonderful appetite and ate with the keenest relish potatoes

roasted in the ashes and slices of fat pork broiled on the coals.

I shall never forget with what delight we all watched her as

she was eating.

   About this time we first began to go to school together. Fanny

was always the best scholar in school of her age. She was a

favorite with scholars and teachers. Her superiority and success

as a scholar were united with such modesty and sweetness of

disposition that unfriendly feelings of rivalry were rarely, if ever,

excited against her. She read a great deal when she was a child.

All the books we had were read by her before she was ten years

old. Uncle gave her a history of England in two volumes--

small volumes --abridged, I think, from Hume and Smollet,

about 1830. She soon had it at her tongue's end. She knew by

heart "The Lady of the Lake" and a great part of "Lalla Rookh"

 - gifts from Uncle Birchard - almost as long ago as I remem-

ber anything about books. These and a collection, styled "Orig-

inal Poems," containing "The Last Dying Speech and Confession

of Poor Puss," "Tit for Tat," and other pieces of about equal

merit, were our constant companions. Finer poetry we have

never seen since. When she was about twelve, she read all the

plays of Shakespeare, and without any aid from friends, so far

as I know, selected those which are generally esteemed the best,

to be read again and again. This reading of plays suggested the

writing of plays, and she with my assistance undertook to

dramatize "The Lady of the Lake." I am sure neither of us









             <B>BOYHOOD - EARLY RECOLLECTIONS          7</B>



had ever heard of such a thing. This job done on joint account

occupied a good deal of our thoughts for a long time. Our suc-

cess was not very flattering. Long afterwards we learned that

it was a common thing to dramatize poems, and that "The Lady

of the Lake" had been upon the stage many years.

  In 1835 when I began to prepare for college and recited Latin

and Greek to Mr. Finch at his house or office, she also took up

the same studies and recited to me after my return from recita-

tion with Mr. Finch and thus got the benefit of his corrections and

explanations. In these studies she was very successful and used

often to wish that she was a boy so she might go with me to

college. She was persevering in her efforts to draw and paint

and, as compared with her schoolmates, made encouraging im-

provement. But she always said that she had no natural gift

either for music, painting, or drawing, and that her only paint-

ings that were tolerable were those she painted when a little

girl with colors obtained from mustard blossoms, hollyhock, and

other garden flowers. Mother was pleased with Fanny's paintings

and fond of showing them. This continued until Fanny grew up,

and became ashamed of the schoolgirl "daubs." She destroyed

or hid a great part of them, but Mother preserved a few of them

and in later years Fanny and myself have had many a happy

laugh over them. What wit and fun she used to pour out over

these pictures and the troubles they had given her!

  When very young she was taught to ride, play chess, and shoot

with a rifle. Although she was always a retiring, quiet, modest

little girl, even so as to be a favorite with those whose sense of

propriety swallows up every other virtue, yet in many manly

sports she was perfectly fearless and very successful. She rode

gracefully and was the best rifle-shot of any lady I ever knew.

She was a skilful player at chess and indeed of many other

games. She was small of her age as a girl, round, plump, and

healthful, neat in her dress, and of very winning manners. I do

not remember to have ever thought her beautiful until after she

was married. Mrs. Wasson says she always thought her the

prettiest girl she ever saw.

  In 1828 Uncle Birchard's health failed and he travelled South,

hoping to be benefited by a change of climate. During his ab-









<B>8            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



sence Fanny and I followed him in his travels by tracing his

route from his letters on the map. We talked of him constantly.

His absence of perhaps ten or fifteen months seemed like an age.

He had been so in the habit of teasing Fanny that she still dis-

liked him. Still, we took great interest in his letters and enjoyed

the scenes and adventures he described and looked forward

anxiously to his return. When he returned Fanny had grown

and improved so much that he no longer thought of teasing her

and they were forever after dear friends. He went to reside

in the northern part of the State, but his visits were frequent

and made us very happy.

  In 183 - Arcena married Mr. Thomas Wasson and soon after

they moved into a house just opposite to ours on the south side of

William Street. When Fanny learned the object of Mr. Wasson's

visits, she became very angry; she scolded at him and about

him; she locked the door when she saw him coming and de-

clared he should never have Arcena for his wife. She finally

became reconciled and after the marriage spent much time at

Mr. Wasson's.

  In the fall after Mrs. Wasson had gone to housekeeping,

Mother went to Lower Sandusky to nurse Uncle through a

severe sickness (bilious fever), and was absent five or six weeks.

Fanny and I boarded with Mrs. Wasson while Mother was gone

and were constantly together. This was an eventful period in

our lives. We were very homesick and had a great many child-

ish trials and troubles. Our friends were very kind to us, but

nothing could comfort us.  We wanted our mother!  We  had

never before known how much we loved her, nor how necessary

she was to our happiness. One of our greatest trials was the

loss of our old cat. Our old family puss, which had been with

us ever since we could remember, was left in the house during

Mother's absence. There being no one to feed her at home, she

wandered off and for several days we didn't know where she

was. After hunting all over the neighborhood, we found her

dead under an apple tree in a neighbor's garden. Her loss under

any circumstances would have been a sore trial to us, but some-

thing led us to think she had been stoned to death! We suffered

almost as much as if she had been a human being. She was one









             <B>BOYHOOD - EARLY RECOLLECTIONS          9</B>



of the family -our little family.  We buried her with suitable

solemnities and were inconsolable several days.

  Before Mother returned a district school was opened near our

house and Mr. Wasson thought it best for us to go.  The school

was free to all and was crowded with scholars of all ages, from

little folks of our own size up to young men grown. The school-

master, Daniel Granger, was a little, thin, wiry, energetic Yankee,

with black hair, sallow complexion, and piercing black eyes; and

when excited appeared to us a demon of ferocity. He flogged

great strapping fellows of twice his size, and talked savagely

of making them "dance about like a parched pea," and throwing

them through the walls of the schoolhouse. He threw a large

jack-knife, carefully aimed so as just to miss, at the head of a

boy who was whispering near me. All the younger scholars

were horribly afraid of him. We thought our lives were in

danger. We knew he would kill some of us. Fanny and I begged

Mr. Wasson with many tears to take us out of school. But he

knew Mr. Granger to be a kind-hearted little man [and] insisted

on our going. We then looked forward to Mother's return as

our only hope. We grew homesick. We had never before been

separated from Mother and went about mourning together and

could not be comforted.  One dismal rainy day we were told as

we came out of school that Mother had returned. She had

travelled on horseback five days through mud and water from

Lower Sandusky, now Fremont. We flew to meet her with a joy

rarely experienced even in childhood. We staid at home from

school that afternoon, sitting in Mother's lap and clinging to her

in perfect happiness.

  During the following winter, about 1831, Sarah Moody, now

Mrs. Kilbourne, came from Massachusetts and spent several

months with us. She was the first relative we had ever seen ex-

cept members of our own family. Our cousin was then about

nineteen or twenty years old and had many accomplishments not

then common in Delaware. We soon grew very fond and very

proud of her. Fanny at once began to learn from our cousin

and was soon possessed of all her acquirements. I shall never

forget how we enjoyed her recitations of poetry and how Fanny

soon learned from her lips "The Adventures of a Raindrop,"









<B>10            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



asking Sarah to repeat it without letting the object be known

until she had it by heart.

  After Mrs. Wasson left us Fanny and Mother did all the

housework.  Fanny became ambitious to make a good house-

keeper and easily acquired all the mysteries of cooking, baking,

and the like. She rose early, called us up to breakfast in the

winter before daylight, and on washing days--Mondays--

hurried us all up and, working with Mother, often had the

clothes "out to dry" before breakfast time. Once in her eager-

ness to be early up and doing she had a fire built and kettles of

water boiling, when, upon calling up Mother, it was found not

to be yet midnight!

  In 1834 we made our first journey. In company with Mother,

we visited all our relatives in Vermont and Massachusetts. I

recollect very little about Fanny during this trip. She was with

her cousins, the girls; I was with the boys. I recollect I was

proud to hear what was said about her. Grandfather Hayes

and Grandmother and, indeed, all the kindred loved her. There

were several superior girls among the Hayes cousins. In fact,

the observations I then made are the foundation of the notion

I have often expressed that the Hayes women were far superior

to the men. And yet I think that then and since Fanny has al-

ways been the favorite of all the grandchildren. Uncle William

R. Hayes, the youngest and best educated of our uncles, loved

her as if she were his own daughter. Uncle Austin Birchard,

a man of sterling native talent and of a warm generous nature,

used to watch her with his bright face and eyes beaming with

love and delight. From this time I began to prize her at her true

value and to think of her as the joy of our little home circle.

Whatever advantages other boys had over me, none had such a

sister as mine!

  During the next two years Fanny attended a high school, the

best in the village, and she was the best scholar in it. Mrs.

Howison, I think, was the principal. In addition to her studies at

school, she read all, or nearly all, the readable books in the cir-

culating library and all she could borrow. Before she went to a

boarding school at Putnam, she had read all the novels and the

greater part of all the other books in Delaware. I say all the









             <B>BOYHOOD - EARLY RECOLLECTIONS          11</B>



novels, perhaps there were some exceptions; but in 1837 I spent

about six months galloping through novels and found none which

she had not read.

  In the spring of 1835 we made a trip together to Lower San-

dusky to visit Uncle Sardis. It happened that General Hinton

was in the stage and was very kind to us, taking care that we

were provided at the hotels with seats at the table, sleeping rooms

at night, and whatever we needed. Supposing that he attended to

everything, I asked no questions about bills and travelled the

whole distance, getting regular meals and sto ping twice--at

Tiffin and Marion--over night without paying a cent. I first

learned this when, having reached Lower Sandusky, I prepared

to settle with General Hinton the bills he had paid for us on the

route. On our return two or three weeks after, it was all made

right. Our good luck was due to Uncle Sardis. All the land-

lords knew him, and in some way--probably from the stage

drivers --it was learned that we were his little folks. While we

were at Lower Sandusky, I was occupied chiefly in watching the

fishermen drawing their seines in the Sandusky River and in

gazing open-mouthed at Governor Lucas' army of invasion or

protection who were marching to the Michigan frontier.

  It was perhaps this year, soon after our return home, that

Fanny was chosen by the girls Queen of May.  She heard that

one of her school friends, Miss-- (possibly Cynthia Lamb) was

disappointed in not being selected. Fanny quietly contrived to

decline the honor and to have it conferred on her friend.

  In the summer of 1836 I went to Norwalk to attend the

Methodist Academy, under the charge of Mr. Chapman [Chap-

lin], and was separated from Fanny a great part of the time until

I left college in 1842. We corresponded very regularly when

apart and spent the vacations together.  Before I left home to

prepare for college, Fanny was in the habit of teasing me a

great deal. To her ridicule I could only oppose my superior

strength.  When I was from nine to twelve years old we had

many little quarrels, she always having the better with her tongue

and I with my fists. This was a singular fact in our lives. I

remember how I feared her ridicule. We loved each other

dearly and yet behaved often as if we were hateful enough.









<B>12           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



After I returned from my first absence at school, we had one

renewal of our former quarrels, which we laughed ourselves out

of before it was fairly begun, and from that time we were loving

sister and brother, our love growing stronger and warmer with

every meeting, without the slightest interruption or jar, to the

day of her death. She cultivated her character and disposition

with as much care as she improved her mind, and with what

wonderful and glorious success!

  While I was at the Norwalk Academy and Mr. Webb's school

in Middletown, Connecticut, preparing for college, she took the

liveliest interest in my studies and improvement. She went with

Mother to a seminary in Putnam. I heard much of her scholar-

ship and beauty. This was the first time it ever occurred to me

that she was not rather plain-looking. I began to grow proud

of her. Never shall I forget the happiness with which we met

in the fall of 1838 on my return from Middletown. She had

graduated and I had returned for a short visit before entering

college. We had been separated a whole year. The stage-coach

drove up to the door of our old home in Delaware. Fanny,

her face so beautiful and joyous, ran out to meet me.  Alas!

how my heart aches as I write! We are to meet no more this

side the grave!
