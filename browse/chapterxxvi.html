     <B>IN THIRTY-NINTH AND FORTIETH CONGRESS -- RECON-</B>



                  <B>STRUCTION--1865-1867</B>



  HAYES  resigned his commission in the army early in June,

1865, and returned to Ohio.  Mrs. Hayes, who had been

with him during his last few weeks of service, rejoined her

mother and children at Chillicothe and continued her stay there

and at Fremont until October, when the Hayes house in Cincin-

nati, which had been leased, could be occupied. Meanwhile

Hayes was maintaining his headquarters at Cincinnati, making

frequent visits to Chillicothe, Fremont, Delaware, and Colum-

bus.  He was busy with his new duties as Congressman and in

making speeches in behalf of General J. D. Cox, Republican

candidate for governor. The Diary is silent during the summer,

and the remaining letters are few and of slight importance.]





                                 FREMONT, June 22, 1865.

  DEAREST:--I  came here Monday, and  am enjoying life as

well as could be expected without my darling. . . . Uncle

has enlarged on Old Whitey's<B>*</B> merits until he is the most re-

markable horse since the Bucephalus of Alexander.

  I shall go over to Willoughby to see Hastings before I come

home. You need not look for me until the middle of next week.

I am talking over the future with Uncle. I suspect we shall

final[ly] leave "events to shape themselves," as McClellan used

to do.                Affectionately, ever,

                                                         R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                  CINCINNATI, July 6, 1865.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- Lucy will still remain, as heretofore, at Chilli-

cothe; if she leaves at all, it will only be for a short visit. The

two big boys, Birch and Webb, are both very anxious to go to

Fremont, and will do so, I think, in about a couple of weeks.

  I have taken a room, southeast corner of Fourth and Elm

Streets, and will make headquarters for the present at the office

of Stephenson and Noyes. I left Chillicothe yesterday. All very

well. Our present purpose is to arrange some way to keep house

next winter and have Mother Hayes with Lucy, but perhaps

nothing better be said to Mother yet. Lucy will like to live

with me at Spiegel Grove whenever I am ready to go there.

                          Sincerely,

                                                   R. B. H.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                                  CINCINNATI, July 9, 1865.

  MY DEAREST:--I have got a large, airy third-story room on

the southeast corner of Fourth and Walnut, and find myself re-

markably well camped. A little hot, and somewhat lonely of

nights. Thus far I find occupation enough with correspondence,

listening to all sorts of applications, and hunting up old ac-

quaintances. . . .

  General Buckland here today, also Senator Sherman. "Poli-

tics a bad trade" runs in my head often. Guess we'll quit....

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                 CLEVELAND, July 30, 1865.

  DEAR LUCY:--The Twenty-third goes out in fine feather.

Perhaps no regiment from Ohio is so fortunate in its reception

and last days. I wish you could have been here. We rode in









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          3</B>



the procession yesterday to the dedication [of the monument to

 the dead of the regiment]. Hastings, Miss Hastings, and Mrs.

 Comly in the carriage I was in -- next after the band. . . . 

   Mother [Webb] and Joe go tomorrow to Niagara. On re-

 turn they go to see the boys [Birchard and Webb] at Fremont.

 Boys very happy there and very good, the cause of happiness

 to others.          As ever, darling, your

                                                          R.

   MRS. HAYES.

                               CINCINNATI, August 25, 1865.

   MY DARLING:--I am not yet quite sure but I think we shall

 go into our old home about the middle of October -- not sooner.

 You can give up your rooms when you come down, if you prefer

 to do so. . . .

   I had a fine time yesterday at the Green Township "Harvest

 Home"--beautiful custom, where old, young, etc., dance, sing,

 eat, play, and listen to speeches.  Matthews made one of the set

 speeches. I was also exhibited as a "vet" and got off very

 luckily with a few successful sentences.

   I shall look for you sometime next week. Have told Uncle

 we shall be there next week--middle to last of the week. We

 shall go via Toledo if you do not object. -- Love to all.

                           Ever your

   MRS. HAYES.                                            R.

                            CINCINNATI, September 17, 1865.

   DEAR MOTHER WEBB:--I left Lucy and the boys at Fremont

 --all well and very happy -- last Tuesday.  I did expect to go

 up to Ross County to see you and George this week, but I am in

 the hands of a political committee for the next three weeks and

 can't determine my own movements much better than I could

 when I was in the army. . . . 

   We can get our house soon after October and may be able to

 get in it by the 15th or 20th. -- Love to all.

                          Affectionately,

   MRS. MARIA WEBB,                             R. B. HAYES.

        Chillicothe.

                              CINCINNATI, October 1, 1865.

  MY DARLING:--The duds are in the house and the repairing,

etc., begun. It will be cramped and I fear seem gloomy to you

at first, but I trust we shall find it as happy as ever.

  I have made two quite successful speeches this week -- one

at Marysville in Union County, and the other at General Grant's

meeting at his old home in Clermont County. I also spoke so-so

at several meetings in this county and city. I speak at Sidney in

Shelby County on the 3d and Wednesday the 4th will come in

the morning train from Toledo. My voice and health are good.

The night ride after speaking at Sidney will leave me a little

fagged out at Fremont.

  I hope I shall be with you Wednesday night and Thursday

night.  I then come home via Wayne County and will go up to

you immediately after the election.--Love to all.

                                Ever, your

  MRS. HAYES,                                               R.

      Fremont.

                             CINCINNATI, October 22, 1865.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I am again pretty well settled in my old

home on Sixth Street. It is very pleasant to be in my own house

again. The boys are not yet all here. I shall have them at

home in a week.

  We are ready to have you as soon as you wish to come. I had

hoped to hear from you before now.  I will come [to Vermont]

for you, as I told you in my last, any time you want me to do so.

I am afraid you did not get my letter. I shall give this the same

direction, that is to Fayetteville. I shall also write to Mr. Mead

the same thing.

  My love to Uncle and Aunt and Cousin Mary.

                     Affectionately, your son,

                                              RUTHERFORD.

  P. S.--When I come I shall stop a few days at Washington on

my way to Vermont.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES,

        Fayetteville, Vermont.

  452 Thirteenth Street, Washington, D. C., November 30, 1865.

--Came here as a member of the House of Representatives for

Second District of Ohio this morning. My travelling compan-

ions were: Mr. [Benjamin] Eggleston, my colleague of the First

District; R. W. Clark of Clermont County (Fifth District), and

his wife; [and Samuel] McKee, of Kentucky, his wife and

son, Frank, and wife's sister, Miss Frances Brainerd, of Oxford,

Ohio. Captain McKee, now of Mount Sterling, represents six-



teen of the hard mountain counties of northeastern Kentucky.

He doesn't travel on the Sabbath, plays no cards, neither drinks

nor uses tobacco, and is an abolitionist! The war has done the

work of centuries. Five years ago the same constituency would

have voted to crucify him.

  Have got my first batch of stationery, and reported myself to

the Clerk of the House, Mr. McPherson. This with my bachelor

quarters is my first step in Congressional life.





                           WASHINGTON, November 30, 1865.

  DEAREST:--My first writing in my own room at Washington

is to you. My surroundings are so-so, viz.: This, the front

room is about twenty-four by fifteen, has a new good carpet, a

coal stove, coal bucket, and spittoon -- stove of good pattern in

front of a mantelpiece and fireplace like ours; black haircloth

short sofa, one armchair and one large chair without arms, and

six good chairs, all black haircloth and black walnut wood; one

office armchair like ours in the parlor, a little marble-top table;

the [wall-]paper of a large, old-fashioned pattern.  The get-up

of the house is all old-fashioned. A back room twenty by fifteen

[with] cottage furniture and closets [and] one front and one

back window.  [My rooms are on the] first floor--left side, as

you enter the house. Altogether pleasant enough.

  Judge James and General Este next above me, and Colonel

Rodney Mason, of unhappy military fame, in the third story

(but a quiet good fellow they say).  The [land]lady is a well-

looking and [well-]tempered Secesh widow or grass- widow.

  It will do for you, I think, though not the very nicest, but still

nice enough.









<B>6            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  My travelling companions were Mr. Clark of Batavia and

his wife, -- they have no family -- (one daughter, married);

Mr. Eggleston and Sands, and McKee, of Kentucky, with his

wife, one sister, and a son. Good company. If you were here

I would be all right.--Love to all.

                          Affectionately ever, your

  MRS. HAYES.                                               R.



  December 1, 1865.--Members of the House are entitled to

some perquisites: All the back numbers of the Congressional

Globe, a small library of some value; seventy dollars for station-

ery; fifty dollars for newspapers for this session, and twenty-

four copies of the Congressional Globe for the Congress of which

he is a member.

  A caucus of the Ohio Union delegation held at Mr. Delano's

rooms tonight. Present: Ashley, Bingham, Buckland, Bundy,

Clark, Delano, Eggleston, Garfield, Hayes, Hubbell, Lawrence,

Plants, Schenck, Shellabarger, Spalding, and Welker. Absent,

Eckley. It was our first, and a very agreeable and harmonious,

meeting. Mr. Delano, chairman, stated the object to be to con-

sult as to candidates for the offices of the House of Represent-

atives, and as to matters connected with the organization of the

House. It was agreed to support Mr. Colfax for Speaker and

Mr. McPherson for Clerk, they being the old officers and having

no opposition. Much talk about the candidates for doorkeeper.

One, Mr. Hawkins Taylor, seemed to have many friends. It

was, however, stated that he sold out the Chase committee. Mr.

Clark made two or three zealous talks in his favor. Mr. Ashley

made some sport by allusions to the Chase business. Spalding

in earnest opposed  him  on  that account.       Schenck  talked

earnestly and well--evidently the leading man of the delegation.

Spalding talked well also, but was unwilling to be bound by the

action of the delegation until his candidate for postmaster was

provided for. We then all agreed to support Colonel Given for

postmaster.

  We agreed to oppose the admission of any delegate from the

Rebel States for the present. Ashley is a large, good-natured,









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          7</B>



popular style of man--full of good humor.         Shellabarger, a

sober, gentlemanly, able man; General Garfield, a smooth, ready,

pleasant man, not very strong; Clark, disposed to talk rather

too much; Lawrence, ditto, and not quite happy in his views;

Delano, clear and correct; Hubbell, talky. Schenck, Delano,

Spalding, and Shellabarger, in the order I name them, strike me,

judging by tonight, as the strongest men. Bingham and Ashley

said so little that I can't place them.

  General Schenck gave notice that he would propose an amend-

ment on the first opportunity by which representation would be

based on suffrage.    All seemed to acquiesce.       On  General

Schenck's suggestion I offered the resolution, with educational

test or condition added. Adopted with two negatives, viz., Ash-

ley and Shellabarger.

  My old college friend, R. E. Trowbridge [of Michigan], came

bouncing into the caucus in his old jovial way to welcome me.

Very little change in him.

  December 2. -- The Ohio members generally dined with Gen-

eral H. B. Banning of Mount Vernon at his headquarters at

Alexandria. Visited the soldiers' cemetery with its three thou-

sand graves, neatly arranged, and its rustic gothic building. A

fine specimen of the work. Pine with the bark on the lumber.

  Fort Rogers with its two hundred-pound rifled Parrotts and

its fifteen-inch columbiad attracted our attention.

  The general caucus [of Republican members] tonight a pleas-

ant thing. Mr. Morrill of Vermont, an intelligent merchant who

put the vote, "Contrary-minded will say no," presided. Thad

Stevens made the important motions. A committee of seven

reported resolutions to be submitted to the Senate and House,

providing for the appointment of a Joint Committee of Fifteen,

nine for the House, six for the Senate, to report as to the status

of the Rebel States and whether they were in a condition to be

represented; and in the meantime all members from those States

to be kept out.

  Colfax,  McPherson,  and  ---  nominated  by  acclamation

for their present places viz., Speaker,  Clerk, ---.  Then

for doorkeeper, Goodenow of New York, and Hawkins Taylor,









<B>8            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



of Iowa or Kansas, stood sixty-six to fifty-seven. Bad for the

West, was the feeling of our men. King, of Minnesota (nom-

inally, really New  York), the present incumbent was named

[for postmaster], also others, all having printed tickets. Here

we seemed caught; we had no tickets ready.  Spalding nom-

inated Colonel Given in a proper speech, Roscoe Conkling sus-

tained King in a speech delivered in a distinct, clear tone, with

great deliberation and in language fitted to print. Spalding's

best point was that Colonel Given was a soldier. Phelps, of

Maryland, nominated a soldier--an officer of colored troops of

his State, one of two who from that State led black men, who

lost a leg at the mine at Petersburg.  Phelps is young, did his

part well.  The best speech, best delivered and all, was by our

Mr. Delano (in favor of Colonel Given).

  [The caucus] adopted, on a test vote the Ohio idea. Stevens

angry, resisted, threatened to leave the caucus. Finally carried

his point as stated, viz., a Joint Committee of fifteen.

  December 3, Sunday.--Little done or seen.  Evening with

"Old Trow," posting up about Kenyon times and boys.

  December 4.--We organized the House according to pro-

gramme.  Mr. Brooks, [Democrat,] of New York, undertook to

make some opposition but the previous question settled him.

Brooks is a pleasant speaker, and a gentlemanly, agreeable man,

judging by appearances. Thad Stevens, grim-looking, cool, with

a ready wit, perfect courage, and the sort of independence which

long experience, assured position, and seventy years of age gives

an able man. He seems to be leader of the House.

  December 7. -- Took Thanksgiving dinner with Judge James

at the Metropolitan Club.  Governor Boutwell, a bright, pleasant-

looking man, reminding me of Waite of Toledo. Cozzens of

Yonkers, author of          ["The Sparrowgrass Papers"], is a

good story-teller, has a fine memory, but is easily overreached

by his wine.



                     WASHINGTON, D. C. December 7, 1865.

  MY DARLING: -- Thanksgiving morning before breakfast. So

far I have no very decided feeling about the life I am leading.









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          9</B>



With my family here, pleasantly homed, I would like it well.  As

it is, I find nothing very gratifying in it and nothing decidedly the

contrary. My quarters are well chosen. I do not yet mess any-

where in particular. I eat two meals a day wherever hunger

overtakes me.  I shall probably soon mess with Delano, Buckland,

Welker, and Hubbell -- a quiet regular set.

  My old college chum Trowbridge and I naturally crony to-

gether a good deal. We called together at Governor Dennison's

the other evening.  Miss Lizzie was alone.  Her cordial, unaf-

fected manners, with some wit and a good disposition, make her

a favorite here. She said the Ohio set were counting on "Aunt

Lu" to be one of them with pleasant anticipations.

  We called at Governor Chase's.  He is more fleshy, an im-

provement rather, and more free and good-natured. He does

not show any uneasy ambition--or rather, he seems to have

made up his mind that his political career is ended; that it is of

no use to worry about it, and yet that it is not by any means his

choice. His little daughter is not at all handsome, and no longer

little, but she is natural and kindly, perhaps bright.  I saw no

other of the family, but think Governor Sprague's family are

with him.

  Mussey is soon to have to be mustered out with his regiment

of colored troops and then ordered to report to his regiment as

captain.  He is under a cloud--such a cloud that one hates to

meet him or be seen with him. His unlucky military career has

been much ventilated since he rose so high, chiefly because he

did not bear himself "meekly" in his prosperity. Fortunately he

seems not to feel or know it.

  Thus far the noticeable men on our side of the house are Thad

Stevens, Judge Kelley, and Roscoe Conkling, and on the Dem-

ocratic side, James Brooks.  Stevens is over seventy, sharp-faced,

grim-looking, as Wilder Joy would have been if he hadn't fat-

tened as he grew old. The only blemish in his puritanical, severe

appearance is a brown wig.  He is witty, cool, full of and fond

of "sarcasms," and thoroughly informed and accurate. He has

a knack of saying things which turn the laugh on his opponent.

When he rises everyone expects something worth hearing, and

he has the attention of all. You remember his speech on con-









<B>10            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



fiscation. He is radical throughout, except, I am told, he don't

believe in hanging. He is leader.

  Judge Kelley of Philadelphia talks often; has studied rhetoric

and elocution, and, I am told, is theatrical overmuch, but so far

his little short speeches have been exceedingly well delivered.

  Roscoe Conkling of New York State delivers measured sen-

tences in a grave, deliberate way that is good.

  James Brooks, former Know-nothing leader, speaks pleasantly

and is the leader of the Democrats; has, of course, to talk for

Buncombe.

  Delano has talked a little and is a good specimen of the lively,

earnest style of Western talkers.

  No doubt abler men have not yet showed themselves--Banks

and others. The House is a more orderly and respectable body

so far than I had expected. The reading of the President's mes-

sage was an imposing thing. The members, all attentive, looked

like the thing we imagine. Mr. Boynton [of Cincinnati] was

elected chaplain. Contrary to my wish and preference, I voted

for Bonte, Judge Storer's son-in-law, to keep with the other Ohio

members, but changed to Boynton, thus electing him before the

vote was declared.

  Tell me all about the boys and Grandma. My love to all. I

shall want you to come back with me if convenient to you.

You will be in time for the sights.

                      Affectionately ever, your

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.



                   WASHINGTON, D. C., December 11, 1865.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We  get on smoothly and pleasantly.  Our

house committees [have been announced]. I left to chance the

matter of important committees. The great number of our party

left small chance for new members on important committees. I

am on one of the tolerably important lawyers' committees, viz.,

Land Claims. I am chairman of the Library Committee. It is

one of the no-account committees in a public sense, but has some

private interest. It is a joint committee of which half are Sen-

ators; then, they are all gentlemen and scholars. It brings one









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          11</B>



in association with the bookish. All matters of art, statuary,

painting, and the like go to this committee. It gives me per-

sonally the control in a great measure of the fine Botonical Gar-

den with its greenhouses, etc., etc., an educated gardener and

twelve assistants, with the whole bouquet business. A funny

sort of thing for me, but very nice and no labor worth mention-

ing. This is for your private contemplation. The dodge is

rather a lucky one as I now see it.

                           Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                  R. B. HAYES.



  December 12. -- Today the credentials of Mr. Maynard and

other claimants to seats from Tennessee were referred on mo-

tion of Mr. Raymond to the Joint Committee of Fifteen, pro-

posed by the Stevens resolutions. Several attempts were made

which by implication gave them some official recognition. These

the Union men with a few exceptions voted against, and [they]

were all defeated. A motion was then carried by the vote of all

except thirty-five Union men to admit these gentlemen under a

resolution containing no allusion to their official character, mak-

ing it purely a courtesy on the part of the House. For this I

voted. Seeing there was division among the Ohio and other

Union members, I voted to lay it on the table, thinking a little

delay and consultation would lead to entire unanimity. The first

thing is to keep together, united and harmonious. I am glad

to see that this duty is generally recognized.

  December 16, 1865. -- Last night a very pleasant meeting of

Ohio men at Mr. James C. Wetmore's. Chief Justice Chase,

both Senators, Judge Swayne, many of the Representatives, Gen-

eral Gilmore, Tom Corwin. A very happy time. Governor Cor-

win, happy, genial, full of humor. I saw him standing at some

distance from where I was comfortably seated. I went to him

and conducted him to my seat. He was happy, genial, and

humorous as ever. Late in the evening he was struck with paral-

ysis on the right side, soon became unconscious, and must die.

So disappears the finest genius Ohio has ever produced; without

an equal as a popular orator in this country. . . .

  December  17.--Corwin still living; wonderful tenacity of

life. Macaulay, speaking of Sydney Smith, said to Mrs. Stowe:

"Truly, wit, like charity, covers a multitude of sins. A man who

has the faculty of raising a laugh in this sad, earnest world is

remembered with indulgence and complacency always."



                     WASHINGTON, D.C., December 17, 1865.

  MY DEAREST: -- I hope to start home in time to be with you

Friday next. The Senate has not yet acted on our adjournment,

and it is not quite settled.

  The death of Uncle Moses [Boggs], so unlooked for, so

peculiarly sad, has impressed me singularly. I don't like to think

of it.  This is the reason I didn't write when I heard of it.  I

put off talking about it and will now.

  Tom Corwin was struck down in the midst of a scene in which

he was one of the happiest and the cause of great happiness to

others. He still lingers in a dying condition.--Love to boys all.

                          Affectionately, yours ever,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.



  January 8, 1866.--Mr. Shellabarger made a speech on recon-

struction that took better than anything thus far of the kind.

He read it from manuscript, but with energy and unction. It

was a decided success.  He was much complimented.  Good for

Ohio!

  January 10, 1866. -- Wilson, Chairman Judiciary [Committee],

called up Kelley's bill, providing for universal suffrage (colored)

in [the] District of Columbia. Several speeches [were] made.

Judge Schofield, of Pennsylvania, made a shrewd and pithy

speech. Judge Kelley delivered an offhand brilliant speech.

Elocution and rhetoric have evidently been pet studies with him.

A very effective, fine thing.

  Evening. -- Caucus decided against the bill of Kelley, prefer-

ring qualified to universal suffrage.  Universal suffrage is sound

in principle. The radical element is right. I was pleased, how-









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          13</B>



ever, that the despotism of the committees and the older mem-

bers was rebuked.  The Suffrage Bill ought not to have been

pressed in advance of other and far more important business.

The rights of the majority as against committees and leaders

have gained. Much confusion and some feeling. Mr. Stevens

quite angry; said he would vote against qualified suffrage; pre-

ferred no bill at all!  The signs of harmony are more hopeful.





                       WASHINGTON, D. C., January 10, 1866.

  DEAREST: -- Mrs. Crook was here yesterday looking after her

husband's interests. She looks, acts, and appears very well in-

deed.  You would like her, I am sure.

  The House has been quite interesting these two days past.

Have been nowhere, seen nobody. President Johnson's first re-

ception last night. Didn't go. The truth is, this being errand

boy to one hundred and fifty thousand people tires me so by

night I am ready for bed instead of soirees.

                             Affectionately, ever,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                       WASHINGTON, D. C., January 10, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE:--Mrs. Grant is an unpretending, affectionate,

motherly person who makes a good impression on everybody.

Her naivete is genuine and very funny at times.  Boston sent a

fund for a library to Grant.  [Senator] Sumner and [Congress-

man] Hooper called to see Mrs. Grant about it. They asked her

how much library room or space she had.  "Well," she said, "I

have given no attention to that.  We have an old bookcase up-

stairs that isn't half full. It has a few Patent Office Reports and

some other books in it. I don't think any of them are interesting

books.  I never read much. When I was a little girl my father

gave me Josephus and another history. I forget what it was.

I tried to read it and couldn't." Sumner suggested "Rollins'

Ancient History." "Yes, that is it. I couldn't read it and I

haven't read much since.  The Patent Office Reports I tried to

read once, but couldn't.  I put a lounge in the room where the









<B>14           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



bookcase is. I thought anybody who read the Patent Office Re-

ports would want to lie down."

  Sumner asked her if she had read her husband's report. She

said: "When he was writing it, he was sometimes a little cross

if interrupted. I came into his room and looked over his shoul-

der. He was pretty short. I asked him how he got along. He

handed me three pages and I read them, but he didn't seem to

want me, and I went out. I read what the New York Herald

said about the general's report. It said it was the best since

Caesar's reports. So I called the general Caesar. But after [a]

while he didn't seem to like it, and said I must stop it."

  I think Mrs. Valette will appreciate this if she can read it.

                          Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                   R.B. HAYES.



  January 12. -- General Banks introduced me to Mrs. Ames,

of Massachusetts (artist). She has made a bust of Lincoln (min-

iature) which seems to be exceedingly good. Seward, Grant,

and others praise it. She talked long and well of her experience

as nurse and her acquaintance with Lincoln. She wants to have

a marble full-size Lincoln ordered. Cost five thousand dollars.

  January 13. -- Miss Anna Dickinson has a voice of great

power; it is monotonous but endures full and strong to the end

of a long lecture. Her forte is argumentative declamation. She

put the case of the national authority to deal as it deems best

with the Rebel States very strongly.

  Conversation ought habitually to be frank and easy but earnest

and dignified.



                    WASHINGTON, D. C., January 21, 1866.

  DEAR MOTHER: -- Lucy got here Thursday evening and is, in

a quiet way, enjoying life here very much. We have been as

yet to no receptions or parties, but find plenty to interest and

amuse in the public buildings, courts, and Congress. The weather

is bright and bracing. Lucy and I went to the preaching of Mr.

Boynton at the Capitol today and heard a good sound talk to a









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          15</B>



large fine audience.  The House makes a beautiful place for

worship.

                         Affectionately,

                      WASHINGTON, D. C., January 28, 1866.

  DEAR MOTHER:--Lucy is still with me. She is very happy.

We do not go to parties or receptions much. Went to one. They

are all alike; rather a bore generally. We sit at the same table

with Vice-Admiral Farragut. A sociable, fine old gentleman--

not old in manner, talk, or looks, but near seventy, I think, in

fact. He has a kind and polite way and everybody likes him.

  We mean to go to the President's and General Grant's this

week. All well at home when I heard last.

                        Affectionately,

  DEAR COLONEL:--Mr. Sherman called with me on Secretary

Harlan of the Department of the Interior this morning. Senator

Sherman will use his influence heartily, and I have no doubt

successfully, in your affair. There is a possibility of three things

which I submit to you: -- An Indian agency in the Indian Ter-

ritory, Fort Smith, being, I think, headquarters; (2) Superin-

tendency of Indian affairs in New Mexico; and (3) Surveyor-

generalship of Dakota Territory. All of these places I regard as

preferable to any clerkship or the like here. Can you muster

physical strength enough for such a place as either of the three?

Keep all this to yourself strictly.  Neither of the places are

vacant and it would be embarrassing to have them publicly

spoken of.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                               HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

                       WASHINGTON, D. C., February 2, 1866.

   DEAR  H--:--I  want  to preach  you  a  short  doctrinal

sermon.  Text, "The Equalization of Representatives." -- Com-

mercial, January 31.  I voted for Schenck's form, but the debates

satisfied me that the committee's plan would do as well, perhaps

better.  It sheds water in all directions.  No objection sticks.

 You quote Shellabarger's six points against it. The Constitution

as practically construed is equally liable to the objection indicated

by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Read them, and you'll see it. Num-

 ber 5 is that the provision may be evaded. Let that go for what

 it is worth.  By Schenck's amendment the foreign-born, who

 are not naturalized, are lost to the North and West -- worth ten

 to fifteen members.  Missouri, Maryland, and other States lose

 by the disfranchisement of Rebels, etc., etc., and upon the whole

 you will, I think, be satisfied with the amendment adopted. It

 gives Ohio one more and Massachusetts one less than Schenck's

 amendment would do. The figures prove it.

   But all this is, of course, not what worried me into worrying

 you.  You  say:  "We would not make the adoption of this

 amendment a condition precedent to the admission of the South-

 ern Representatives."  I move a reconsideration of that opinion.

 The amendment never can be got except as a condition.  The

 South will never give up its power if admitted with it. I would

 be disposed, I think, to let in the loyal Tennesseeans when their

 State adopts it. The Rebel States will always be represented

 (during our day, at least) by repudiators--by men willing to

 assume every sort of claim payable South. Twenty-two Sen-

ators added to the twelve or fifteen now there, and the political

power of four millions and a quarter of negroes in the House

and the Electoral College, is a serious thing. It deserves recon-

 sideration--that idea of yours.

   Do you want any books, apple seeds, or oats?  I am in that

 trade now.

                                     Yours,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Harmony is rather up just now. We may get through

without a break.

MR. MURAT HALSTEAD,

    Cincinnati, Ohio.



                       WASHINGTON, D. C., February 4, 1866.

  MY  DEAR MOTHER:--We  have had very beautiful winter

weather these last few days. We enjoy life very much now.

As to what is called gaiety, we take little part in it. It is simply

tedious to me. We have been out only twice in that line. Once

to Secretary Harlan's reception, and one night to General Grant's

first reception, and the same night to Senator Sherman's. Gen-

eral Grant's was very enjoyable from the large numbers of notice-

able [notable (?) ] people to look at. I have always wanted to be

the first, the very first at a big party. I never heard of anybody

who was first. We did it at Grant's. There were a goodly num-

ber of ladies and gentlemen in the clothing-rooms all waiting

for somebody to break the ice. Lucy and I hurried off our

things and got down first. It was right jolly. General and Mrs.

Grant, a sister, and a staff officer's wife [were] waiting anxiously

for an attack. We charged and had a good merry time of it all

to ourselves.

  Lucy goes to the House daily. Finds it very pleasant in all

respects.

  I hope Uncle is in better health. He will be interested in

knowing that I find my Fine Arts Committee a very interesting

one. The members all attend promptly and say it is the most

interesting committee they ever belonged to. We have artists of

all shades, learned professors, and book men before us, explain-

ing their projects at every meeting, etc., etc.

                         Affectionately,

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.                                        R.



                   WASHINGTON, D. C., February 15, 1866.

  DEAR GUY:--Enclosed you will find Stephen's papers. The

reason I didn't write again [was that] I discovered on another

visit after writing you that you had previously been pardoned.

  There is really no reason to feel any uneasiness because of the

delays in acting upon the cases of the different Southern States.

Those which send Union men will be represented in Congress,

and fully restored without any severe or degrading conditions.

There is a great deal of nonsense on all sides, but no substantial

interests are likely to be sacrificed. I am told that the Committee

on Reconstruction will report favorably on Tennessee at an

early day.

  I really can't tell about land sales. We hear some hard stories

about the treatment Northern people get in many parts of the

South. This for a time will naturally discourage the purchase

of lands.

  I am in much haste. Love to yours.

                     As ever, your friend,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GUY M. BRYAN,

                    WASHINGTON, D. C., February 28, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I don't know whether I have written to you

since the veto<B>*</B> or not. Many of our good men still hope that

we may retain the President, but it is a very faint hope, scarcely

more than a wish that he may return "to the bosom of his fam-

ily," as Lucy says. The general impression is, however, that

Rebel influences are now ruling the White House and that the

sooner Johnson is clear over, the better for us. Almost all are

for going forward with business and measures in the usual and

proper way without excitement or abuse.

  We had a pleasant excursion on Saturday to the Naval Acad-

emy at Annapolis, which was in every way enjoyable.  At the

old capitol of Maryland and the academy, there was an abundance

to see and the company was good. -- Lucy expects to leave this

week.

                           Yours,

                          WASHINGTON, February 28, 1866.

  DEAREST:--You left me last evening, and I am already half

homesick about it. Possibly I would not have thought of it

so feelingly, but the sight of these gloves put me in mind of it.

What a happy time we have had! Six weeks of real, genuine,

old-fashioned love.--Love to Grandma and the boys all.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- With a party, Generals Schenck, Crook,

Smith, and their ladies, I went to see the picture of "The Storm

in the Rocky Mountains" by [Albert] Bierstadt. It is very

beautiful and wonderful.  By gaslight the effect is incompre-

hensible, such brilliancy and light and shade! Mr. Bierstadt says

it is better by daylight.  I shall see.

  We are not quite sure yet whether Andy is with us or against

us--in a party sense, I mean. Doctrinally, he is against us on

many things and with us on a few.

  Love to Mother. Lucy is at home.

  MY DEAR UNCLE:--We are still not clear as to the chances

of harmony with the President. He no doubt differs and has all

along avowedly and openly differed with us on some important

matters. At the time of his unfortunate talk on the 22nd he

seemed to be surrounded and possessed by all manner of evil

influences. He now seems to feel that he was misled and is

really anxious to conciliate. If he signs [the] Civil Rights Bill

and the Tennessee Resolution which will both pass soon, the

chances are that a complete rupture will be avoided. Otherwise,

otherwise. It is an interesting time to be here and I enjoy it

very much now,--the last three weeks more than ever before.

                        WASHINGTON, D. C., March 17, 1866.

  DEAR FORCE: -- Thanks for the items from Mississippi.  I had

heard before of the intention to try to make you a candidate for

judge. I trust it will be done. If the chances are fair, no doubt

it will.

  I could argue with you on the wisdom and justice of what

Congress is doing with our erring sisters if I knew exactly your

points. The truth is, Congress has done next to nothing yet

on that subject, and can give good reasons for not having yet

done anything. The position held by the majority is this: The

Rebel States having gone into insurrection and lost their law-

ful State Governments, it is for the law-making power of the

Nation to say when (or whether) such new State Governments

have been set up as ought to be recognized. Is not this sound?

Granting this, ought we to recognize any State Government which

does not undertake, at least, to afford adequate protection to

Union people and freedmen? And further, is there evidence

showing such State Governments except in Tennessee and pos-

sibly Arkansas?

  The practice will come to you, no fear of that.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MY DEAR DARLING: -- The last week is the only one since you

left that you would have enjoyed here particularly. The Con-

necticut election early in the week was an enjoyable thing. The

passage of the Civil Rights Bill in the Senate over the veto was

a most exciting and delightful thing-such enthusiasm was mani-

fested. Things have improved here. The general feeling is

hopeful, loyal, and patriotic. A great change from that [of

February] 22nd, when treason crept out and triumphed. The

next thing was the great party at Grant's the night of the passage

of the Civil Rights Bill. All our side was there in great spirits,

Trumbull, Stevens, and all. The President stood between Gen-

eral and Mrs. Grant. Vice-President (Rebel) Stephens stood

near. Montgomery Blair, etc., etc. Old Thad shook hands

cordially with Andy. Andy presented him to Mrs. Grant. It

was the happiest gathering I have seen.  Andy looked and be-

haved very well indeed.

  Judge Kelley introduced me to his daughter, telling her if she

ever saw my wife she would see the image of her mother. (Her

mother was a first wife.) He said she looked like the daughter

except as she departed from her mother in some resemblance to

him--all an injury. The daughter is a good-looking young

person. . . .  Love to the bairns.

                   Affectionately ever, your

                                                         R.

  DEAR MOTHER: -- The appearance of things here has improved

decidedly since the passage of the Civil Rights Bill over the veto.

Both President and Congress feel better. After growling at

each other a long time, they have come to blows and that being

over they are nearer being friends again. . . .

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                        WASHINGTON, D. C., April 15, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I was at Mount Vernon yesterday for the

first time. Washington was a capital judge of fine sites for towns

and mansions. His own seat was fitly chosen. The views of

the Potomac are beautiful. His farming was on a royal scale.

The sentiment merely from "the genius of the place," the tomb,

and the like, did not strike me. The truth is, if it were not

sacrilege, I should say Lincoln is overshadowing Washington.

Washington is formal, statue-like, a figure for exhibition; but

both were necessary to complete our history. Neither could have

done the other's work.

  I bought you a cane which may get to you sometime--a

common hickory stick, genuine.

  I think some of coming home on a ten days' leave, one of these

days. If so will call at Fremont and talk things up with you. I

have no plans.

  The country will go through all safe. Some dangers ahead,

serious dangers, just enough to give interest to what would

otherwise be a very dull life.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                        WASHINGTON, D. C., April 15, 1866.

  MY DARLING: -- I went to Mount Vernon yesterday. . . .

It is a beautiful spot. The extensive views of the Potomac are

the great feature. The mere "genius of the place," I hardly

thought of. The spot was happily chosen for our great man's

home. It was the anniversary of Lincoln's death. It seems to

me Lincoln is rather eclipsing Washington. I feel more than

ever that, taking him all in all, he was the highest character.

But it is like sacrilege to make these comparisons. It is probably









<B>24           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



true that neither could have done the other's work, and without

the work of both we should have had a different history.

just passed. It was a curious and pretty sight--many bands,

flags, etc., etc. Their cheering for the House and Senate as they

passed the east front was peculiarly enthusiastic. Their bands

  I see General and Mrs. Crook almost daily. -- Love to all the

boys.                Affectionately, ever your

                                                         R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                         WASHINGTON, D. C., May 10, 1866.

  DEAREST: -- We had good speaking in the House yesterday

and the day before. The look of things is very favorable.

  I sat this morning at breakfast opposite an agreeable ladylike-

looking young woman with a rather unmanageable, troublesome

four-year-old. I was interested in her and it set me to thinking.

The result was an impression that I am really more in love with

my wife than I ever was before!  Object?  .  .  .  Love to

the bairns all.

                  Affectionately ever, your

                                                         R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                        WASHINGTON, D. C., May 13, 1866.

  MY DARLING:--Looking around at dinner today, the changes

are chiefly in the ladies. . . . The Members of Congress--

all now wifeless -- are the same you knew and a few added.

  We (the Schenck Military Committee), Crook, etc., visited

Arlington. It is all right. Lee--his is the severest punishment

of any Rebel. Expelled from such a paradise, and it made a

graveyard for twelve thousand Rebel and loyal dead!

  Last week's work on Reconstruction was very interesting and

things are looking well. Some doubts as to the Senate. But if,

as I think they will, they merely amend a little by striking out a

part, all will come out right. -- Love to all.

                         Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.



  May 15. -- The [Republican] policy is to leave to the States the

question of suffrage. But in the District and the Territories

it is for Congress to lay down the rule. Now, colored people

are citizens of the United States. In some States they are al-

lowed to vote, in some they are not. And in the places where

all the States are interested, it is right to treat all citizens alike.

When they [the people of the Territories] come to form State

Governments, I leave it to the people to say, as in Colorado.

  Besides, in the District [of Columbia] and in Territories they

[the citizens] have no political power.

  My decided preference: Suffrage for all in the South, colored

and white, to depend on education; sooner or later in the North

also--say, all new voters to be able to write and read.



                         WASHINGTON, D. C., May 16, 1866.

  MY DARLING:--. . .  I send you a paper marked about

Fullerton. I am inclined to think my party friends are more than

half wrong, and that Fullerton is more than half right. The class

of men who are in charge of the freedmen is not very likely

to be correct in conduct. They are weak men of small experience,

or corrupt men in too many instances.

  We are getting on finely here now. Andy is less violent and

we are more harmonious.

                        Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  Cincinnati, May 24, 1866.--Our darling little George died

today at half-past one P. M. He was attacked with scarlet fever









<B>26            RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



three or four weeks ago. After a week or two we thought him

out of immediate danger, and I returned to Washington. A

week ago he seemed so much worse that I was dispatched that

he was sinking. I came home a week ago tomorrow. I found

him low and was prepared for the worst.  He was a very hand-

some child; abundant waving light hair; very large blue eyes and

a broad, full forehead.  He looked like my sister Fanny.  His

corpse reminds us of hers.

  He was born in Chillicothe. I heard of his birth at Harrison-

burg, Virginia, about the 5th of October, 1864, while with

Sheridan in his Valley campaign. I named him George Crook

after our favorite corps  commander,  General  Crook.       His

cousins in Chillicothe were very fond of him. They called

him "the little general" or "the little soldier."  The brothers

called him "the king," because he had his own way. He was a

large child, weighing ten pounds when he was born.  Born

September 29, he was nineteen months, twenty-five days old.





                         WASHINGTON, D. C., June 6, 1866.

  MY DARLING:--I knew you would feel more keenly the loss

of the dear boy when you got home, and in the quiet hours were

reminded of his loss. My chief consolation is found in thinking

of the good ones we have left. . . .

  Andy is thought to be more conciliatory in his feelings, but

nothing is very certain in that quarter. There are certainly some

good indications. . . .

                 Affectionately, ever yours,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                WASHINGTON, June 6, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- Back at the usual work. The President is

believed to be in better feeling. Everybody wants to get home

and we hope to adjourn at the usual time.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  Thursday, June 14. -- Ohio caucus seven to two for Concur-

rent Resolutions and for admitting States as they ratify; eight

to one against negro suffrage as a condition of restoration.

Goodish time of it; adjourned at II:30 P. M.



                        WASHINGTON, D. C., June 14, 1866.

  MY SWEET WIFE:--I read with genuine sympathy for you

the beautiful talk you send me about the dear one who is gone.

I wish you were here to talk with me and let me fondle you, as

you talk about him.  But I suppose you are right. Well, I hope

it will not be long.

  We passed the plan of Reconstruction as it came from the

Senate.  No man elected, or claiming to be, Union, voted against

it. Raymond, Green Clay Smith, and all were right. Rousseau

was absent, perhaps purposely.

  General Crook and wife are still here. I shall not room

here next session, as I mean to have you with me as much [as]

possible. I consult you as to the rooms I shall engage before I

go home. I am inclined to go to the Avenue House. Other

Ohio men talk of it. What say you?

                         Yours ever,

  MRS. HAYES.                                             H.



                         WASHINGTON, D. C., June 17, 1866.

  MY DARLING:--I don't believe I told you my feelings when

I got your letter that you were not coming to be with me the

rest of this session. I feel more and more the desire to be with

you all the time. Oh, an occasional absence of a week or two

is a good thing to give one the happiness of meeting again, but

this living apart is in all ways bad.  We have had our share of

separate life during the four years of war. There is nothing in

the small ambition of Congressional life, or in the gratified

vanity which it sometimes affords, to compensate for separation

from you. We must manage to live together hereafter. I can't

stand this, and will not.  Don't you want to be with me?--Love

to all the boys.

                     Affectionately ever,

  MRS. HAYES.                                             R.

  DEAR UNCLE:--All things looking well here. Do not be aston-

ished if you get in a few days a box by express. It contains

nothing more explosive than what is said to be pretty fair

Bourbon.

  We can't yet predict the end of the session.  From the 15th

to the last of July is probably the time.

                          Sincerely,

                        WASHINGTON, D. C., [July 1, 1866].

  MY DEAR ONE: -- We missed you so much at Gettysburg [June

28-30]. It was cool, fine weather. The company good. "All

things lovely." The battle-field must be one of the finest in the

world. We had for guide and chaperon a gentleman who has

made it a study for a long while, and I now feel that I know

the battle as if I had seen it. There was nothing more in the

generalship than I had supposed, but the stubbornness and good

conduct of the army, of men and officers generally, was worthy

of the cause. The Rebel attack was a very brilliant but rash

thing.

  Pick a cool day to go to Fremont. Every week or two, even

in this weather, there is a little cool spell.

  I shall not come home until the end of the session, now sup-

posed to be on the 16th. -- Love to all.

                        Affectionately, your

for a good many hot days.

  We have the inevitable tariff before us noon and night. I hope

we shall get off in a fortnight. A little cholera wouldn't be bad

now.  Anything to get up a scatterment. -- Write a word.

  MY DARLING:--We are in a very exciting caucus. Hot as

blazes.  Senator Wilson is speaking in an excited, earnest way.

Dennison has resigned--others are going. We may be in ses-

sion a month or more longer. It is likely I will have to come

to see you. It is perhaps too hot for you to come here.

There seems to be no doubt as to the result in my district.

  Lucy is at Chillicothe, or rather is at her Aunt Boggs'.

  A good deal of cholera here and increasing. I shall go to

Lucy the latter part of the week. Will not come to Fremont

for ten days or a fortnight.--Love to the boys [Birchard and

Webb].

            KINGSTON, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO, August 15, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I came here Saturday, and am having a mild

attack of fever.

  Mother Webb is in a very critical condition. I fear she will

not get well. I write chiefly to let you know it for the sake of

the boys, especially Birtie. I do not want him to be struck too

suddenly, as I fear might be the case.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                               CINCINNATI, August 27, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I came down from Kingston Friday.  Mother

Webb improved slowly during the whole of last week. We now

have some hope of her ultimate recovery. Her case is still, how-

nominated for Congress without opposition.</FONT>









<B>30           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ever, very critical. She was much comforted by the appearance

of the boys. If she continues to improve I can send Birch and

Webb or bring them myself to Fremont about the last of this

or the first of next week, if you want them again.

  We begin our active campaign the last of next week.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                    CINCINNATI, Monday, August 27, 1866.

  MY DARLING:--There is to be a convocation of the Union

faithful at Columbus on Wednesday, the 29th, and I shall at-

tend. If you can send the boys by the stage to Columbus

Wednesday or Thursday, it will save time and expense for me

to go on with them from there Friday morning.  Of course you

will not send them if Grandmother is not improving.

Friends here all well. Cholera pretty much gone.

  Politics funny--very--and decidedly agreeable. We think

favorable.

  I may go to Philadelphia from Fremont to the Southern Con-

vention on the third. We open up here September 8, and keep

it up then until after election.

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.



                            CINCINNATI, September 9, 1866.

  MY  DARLING:--Dr.  James'  [Webb's]  letter to Dr. Davis

makes me again anxious about Mother Webb. Dr. Davis will

go up if nothing unforeseen occurs in a few days. I hope her

case will turn out more favorably than Dr. James seems to ap-

prehend.

  I sleep at Dr. Davis' and feed where hunger overtakes me.

I speak every night. The canvass has opened in a way that is

most encouraging and exceedingly pleasant to me.  I have been

in five country precincts including the most distant one and in

three wards and at the great city meeting.  My written speech

has gone off well, and the offhand speech reported in the Com-









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          31</B>



mercial of today, which I send you, delivered at the big meeting

in Court Street took better than any speech I ever delivered.

The report is a good one but omits "laughter and cheers" of

which there was a superabundance.

  Many things please me. I always felt as you did that it was

a sort of degradation to have Gaslobs about assuming to be my

rival in the party. He has now gone, as you see, clear over

and is speaking for the Rebs.

  A  lot of old Kanawha  soldiers, chiefly Thirty-fourth men,

after I was done speaking last night, came onto the stand and

carried on in a style that would have delighted you. If it keeps

going as it begins, you would enjoy being here.

  Love to all, particularly Grandmother.

                      Affectionately ever,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                           CINCINNATI, September, 16, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- While speaking in Sixth Street market space

last Wednesday evening, I got a dispatch that Mother Webb was

sinking. I went up and at daylight found her conscious and

able to talk a little, but in a dying condition. She had no suffer-

ing the last twenty-four hours; was cheerful, calm, and affec-

tionate.  Died  Friday  morning  before  daylight,  without  a

struggle.

  The boys reached here safely last night. . . .  Funeral

this afternoon. -- Will write you in a few days about the boys.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                           CINCINNATI, September 23, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I send the boys to go to school or not at

Fremont as you prefer. It is probable that they will stay with

you, if you wish it, all winter, but I do not want that considered

as absolutely settled until I see you after the election.

  The canvass is an exceedingly pleasant one. The meetings

are large and attentive and the prospect good. The Democrats









<B>32           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



are now working pretty well, especially in Eggleston's district,

but they can't, I think, get anything in this county.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                               CINCINNATI, October 1, 1866.

  MY DEAR GUY:--Your letter of the 18th came duly to hand.

It finds me in the midst of an unusually exciting political strug-

gle. The election is next week. I am a candidate for re-election

and expect to succeed by a large majority.  I will bore you with

only a few words on politics.

  I think the election will show that the people are resolved to

adopt the Congressional plan of Reconstruction. It does not

"disfranchise" anybody in the South. It disqualifies for holding

office those who have been leaders--the old office-holders. All

young men are qualified although implicated in the Rebellion.

The disqualification probably applies to no man in your State

who is now under twenty-seven or eight years of age. Recol-

lect too that the disqualification can be removed in any case by

a two-thirds vote of the Senate and House. That vote will be

obtained in all cases in a few years, if peace and loyalty are

restored in the South. You have, of course, seen our plan. I

send you one of my electioneering speeches which contains the

different sections, and let me frankly say that if we carry these

elections, this plan contains the best terms you will ever get--

and they should be promptly accepted.  The young men are with

us almost universally. The life and energy of the North is with

us. If the elections are against us, we shall submit. If they are

for us, the Democracy will submit.  We shall be united in any

event. Do not be again deceived with the hope of Democratic

help in a further struggle. I hope you will give the Congressional

plan a fair hearing. If we succeed you must adopt it, if you

regard your own welfare.

  I am very much obliged by the photographs. They are in our

album of particular friends and near relatives. My wife is in

love with the fine faces of your children. I can readily believe

all you say of your boy.









             <B>RECONSTRUCTION--1865-1867          33</B>



  I have three boys living--my three eldest.  We lost two boys

-- both under two years.  Birchie, aged thirteen is in all respects

a noble and promising boy.  Webb aged ten and Rud aged eight

are good boys also. They are all absent from home now. The

two big boys with their uncle at Fremont and Ruddy at Chilli-

cothe.  My mother now aged seventy-five is at Columbus in good

health.  Uncle often talks of you and would give a good deal

to see you.  If you come North, do try to visit him as well as

myself.  My brother-in-law  (whom you know), Dr. Webb, is

travelling in Europe.  My wife's mother died a few weeks ago.

With no small children and no old person about the house, my

family seems small. I hope I shall see you soon.

  I am sure you did all that friendship required to meet General

Fullerton.  I count upon the constancy and sincerity of your

feelings by what I know of my own towards you.  The only

things he could have said to you was to give you my views of

the future duty of the South. If we succeed in the elections

now pending, don't be deceived by Andy Johnson.  The North

will be far better united during the next struggle, if unhappily

there is one, than during the last. Johnson and his office-holders

will be "a mere snap -- a flash in the pan."  Ten thousand

majority in Ohio is as good for practical purposes as a unani-

mous vote.  We shall be united in action.  We shall submit, if the

majority is clearly against us.  Our adversaries will submit, if it

is otherwise.  My last word is, don't let Andy Johnson deceive

you.  He don't know the Northern people.

                           As ever,

                                                           R.

                               CINCINNATI, October 6, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We  are talking of putting a notice in the

papers about two boys we lost a fortnight ago. They left their

homes in good health and spirits one morning and have not since

been heard from! Can you give any information to their anxious

parents?

  Dr. Joe arrived in New York Friday.  He started home on

   3









<B>34           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



hearing of his mother's serious illness. The news of her death

reached him at New York. We expect him tomorrow.

  The labors of the campaign closed with me yesterday after-

noon. It has been an exceedingly pleasant time. The Democrats

are spending a great deal of money obtained from New York.

They have also made great use of the prejudice against negroes.

The struggle is to elect Pendleton. I think they will fail. The

negro prejudice is rapidly wearing away, but is still very strong

among the Irish, and people of Irish parentage, and the ignorant

and unthinking generally. But I think we shall beat it all

around.

  After election, say about next Friday or Saturday, I shall

probably come up.--Love to all.

                          Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                 R.B. HAYES.



                   FORT WAYNE, INDIANA, October 15, 1866.

  MY DARLING:--I got here this evening en route for the

Pacific Railroad. Buckland joins me at Chicago. We go from

Chicago to [by] the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad, and

from Saint Joseph by steamboat to Omaha and so out west. We

expect to return in about ten days, and hope to meet you at Fre-

mont about the 25th or 26th.

  The boys are very happy and well. You will be so proud

of them -- two great boys they are. I told them you would come

with Rud and Dr. Joe.  They will expect you. -- Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

  MY DEAR:--I am well and doing well and hope that these

few lines will find you enjoying the same blessing. We have

had a good time -- will not be back to Fremont so soon as we

expected--not perhaps for a week or ten days from today.

         I wish you were here, oh, so much.

  DEAR GUY:--I would have sent the enclosed letter as to

Stephen's affair before, but I have been absent attending in the

last sickness and at the funeral of my mother at Columbus and

Delaware. She died without pain in the possession of her

faculties to the last, and confident of the future. She was al-

most seventy-five years of age. Uncle Birchard was with her

and the most of her grandchildren.

  MY DARLING:--The boys are healthy and happy. They en-

joy their schools and appear to be improving. The pet pigeons

delight them, of course. Webb will sit and watch them in their

house -- one end of the corn-house -- by the hour. The morn-

ing after I reached here we managed to put the new saddle and

bridle on Rock when Webb was attending to the pigeon-house.

When he saw Rock hitched to the big oak with the new trappings,

he comprehended the situation instantly, mounted and was off

to show them.

  I told Birch the secret. He was silent a moment, and then with

emphasis said, "Mercy, mercy on us, Uncle Joe married." It

almost took his breath away, and yet he seemed to be pleased.



  I shall probably come home Thursday, perhaps not until Fri-

day. I wish you were here.

                       Affectionately,

  DEAR UNCLE: -- We reached here this morning. Ruddy thinks

better of Washington since he got acquainted with the boys of

Mr. Eggleston and Colonel McKee. We are settling down rapidly

and shall be at home as much as ever in a day or two.  The

meeting of members after their separation is like old college days.

  December 2. -- Our caucus last night was good-tempered and

sensible.  The only matter decided was that the members of the

House don't want the appointments made for political reasons

to be confirmed.  Committees were appointed to report as to

business hereafter.--I room and board at the old place.

                          Sincerely,

                    WASHINGTON, D. C., December 13, 1866.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I saw the pictures of the Pacific Railroad

last night.  I fear you may think it a poor purchase.  Under a

good glass some of them are very fine, and the series give a very

correct notion of the country and the looks of everything, espe-

cially of the Pawnees.

  I bought secondhand this morning four of Ruskin's lectures

entitled "Unto This Last." They look goodish.

  We are just passing a resolution to adjourn on the 20th to

the 3d [of January].  If the Senate concur, as I think they will,

we may perhaps take a Christmas dinner with you.

  Ruddy goes to school to his mother and seems to be doing well.

He learns easily and rapidly.  In his taste for books he is about

half-way between Birch and Webb. -- Love to the boys.

                          Sincerely,

  DEAR UNCLE:--We  have decided to accept an invitation to

spend Christmas in New Orleans.  It is probable we shall return

by way of Fremont and be there about New Year's day.  [Sen-

ator] Wade and wife are going with others; probably, also

Buckland and wife.  We shall probably send Rud to Fremont

by Ashley or Trowbridge or somebody.  I will be more specific

perhaps before I close this. The excursion will go via Lynch-

  DEAR UNCLE:--Good times, banquets, etc., etc., at Knoxville,

Chattanooga, and here.  We visit the battle-fields and mix with

the leading Rebels in a friendly and sensible way.  We go to

Memphis  tonight.  Stay all day Christmas  and go to New

Orleans.

  Lucy is doing her best and enjoying it hugely. -- Love to boys.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- We are thus far on our way to New Orleans,

with everything thus far the very pleasantest possible.

  I last night experienced a new sensation.  I went with General

Howard to a meeting of colored people and made them a short

talk.  Their eager, earnest faces were very stimulating.

  Sorry Buckland and his wife are not here.  We meet the lead-

ing Rebels everywhere.     The  Rebel officers are particularly

interesting.  I get on with them famously.  I talk negro suffrage

and our extremest radicalism to all of them.  They dissent but

are polite and cordial.

  Love to boys. Lucy very happy.

                            Yours,

  DEAR UNCLE: -- On the opposite page is General Beauregard's

autograph which please save. He wrote it this minute.

  One of the pleasant points in this trip is making the acquaint-

ance of the leading Rebel officers.

  DEAR JUDGE:--I will hand your letter about Shields' confirma-

tion to our Senators with favorable talk. As to the other, I get

more letters on the other side, but have done nothing more than

to refer them to our Senators. Do you watch the movements

here? What do you think of them? Being myself on the radical

side of all of them, I may have lost my sense and would like to

hear a cool outsider talk.

                            Yours,

  DEAR UNCLE: --  Buck [land] and I are both a little shaky on

the Randall Bill. I will bear watching quite as much as he will.

I think we shall both light on your side of the question but our

state of mind is, as you used to say, "between souse and sug-

gerly."<B>*</B> I am confident, however, that the bill will not pass at

this session.

  I hear the boys are at home. I suppose they will (the two big

ones) return to your house after this week's doings and that

Lucy and Rud will return here soon. I leave it all to her.

                           Sincerely,

                       WASHINGTON, D. C., January 29, 1867.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am this morning in receipt of yours of the

26th as to the next Union nomination for governor. Since Gen-

eral Cox's declination one or two persons, in a merely casual way,

have spoken to me on the subject. Your letter contains the first

and only serious suggestion of the sort I have received from

Ohio. I therefore do not wish to speak now decisively, or for the

public. I will mention a few things which strike me at first

blush, one or the other of which will perhaps end the matter.

  Having been elected by the Union people of the Second Dis-

trict to an office which they knew I wanted, it would not be right

to resign it without their approval. Again, I would not go into

the State Convention unless it was quite certain that I would

be supported by the delegates of Hamilton County. And, finally,

I would not go into a contest with any other Union man of

Hamilton County for the support of the delegation of that

county. In short, nothing but the general desire and approval

of the party and its public men in the county would justify me

in consenting to leave the office to which I have just been elected.

  I prefer you would for the present keep this to yourself, with

the understanding that I will write you fully, frankly, and

definitely when I am a little better informed in the premises.

                           Sincerely,

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,                           R. B. HAYES.

  DEAR UNCLE: --. . . The Randall Bill stands no chance

at all. Hooper's Bill not much.

  No change, is the present feeling in finance.  Nothing will be

done on impeachment, or Reconstruction at this session.

                           Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                    R. B. HAYES.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I  get letters about the governorship.          It

doesn't worry me any, but I am really puzzled what to say,









<B>40           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



This is the truth as I now see it: I don't particularly enjoy Con-

gressional life.  I have no ambition for Congressional reputation

or influence--not a particle.     I would like to be out of it

creditably.  If this nomination is pretty likely, it would get me

out of the scrape, and after that I am out of political life decently.

On the other hand, I ought not and will not resign my seat in

Congress to be governor unless the people of my district approve

it. You see the case.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

                     WASHINGTON, D. C., February --, 1867.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Since writing you early last week I have

received a good many letters from Cincinnati and the drift of

them all is to confirm me in the correctness of my offhand im-

pressions. I wish, therefore, to have it known that I decline to

allow my name to go before the Union State Convention. Of

course I feel flattered by the favorable way in which I have

been named, and greatly obliged to my friends for their partiality.

I would very much enjoy, I am sure, to make the canvass, and

I do not pretend to be indifferent to the honor. If I had no

place such as the one I now occupy I should quite willingly take

the chances of getting a nomination.      But under the circum-

stances, as I said in my former letter, I ought not to resign with-

out the approval of the people who sent me here; and there is,

judging by my correspondence, no general desire that I should

do so.  I shall write no letter for publication and of course

want my decision made known without any "flourish of trumpets"

or the assignment of reasons.

  This letter is marked "private" merely to indicate that I don't

want it to be published.

                           Sincerely,

            WASHINGTON, D. C., February 7, 1867.  Friday.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- Lucy reached here this morning safe and well.

It is a most interesting period in Congress. She will enjoy it

very much. Our new plans suit me exactly. Grant, Thomas,

and Sheridan are now known to be all right.

  Your letter on the governorship came one day too late. I

decided not to run.  The principal reason is I do not like in these

times to leave a place to which I have just been chosen on my

own request. But it's all right, I am sure. It is something to

have declined an office of the sort.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

                           WASHINGTON, February 22, 1867.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- Enclosed is the account of Carpenter's Lin-

coln. I have the picture and will also have Marshall's, and will

one of these days express them both to you. As one is framed,

be careful in opening them.

  I send you a rather curious phrenological estimate of the Con-

gressmen on the Pacific Railroad excursion (Buck[land] and my-

self included) with portraits. It is curious as showing that Mr.

[Samuel R.] Wells, who is a respectable person, and who pro-

fesses to judge people on the principles of what he calls the

sciences of phrenology and physiology, really gets his impressions

just as you and I do, from their manners, conduct, and con-

versation.  He is evidently not influenced a particle by tempera-

ment or head and features.  He is singularly and laughably

wrong in Buck's case.  The only interest in the whole thing is

that it shows the impression that a tolerably good observer gets

on a short acquaintance with us.

  We are getting on just right in politics here.  The Commercial

regrets my course one day, but the next day proved I was right.

                           Sincerely,

propriation of one hundred thousand dollars to buy your father's

tion or opposition. It will no doubt pass the House in the same

  DEAR UNCLE: -- The post-office and collectorship at home have

kept me here this week, and may keep me several days yet. It

a chance of doing it.

  DEAR SIR: -- Yours of 21st came to hand this morning.  My

chief personal objection to being a candidate for governor was

removed when the Legislature squarely stood up to the suffrage

issue. My supporters in the Second District are not as willing

General Schenck be a candidate? I do not wish to run against

  Keep this letter to yourself and write me what you know of

General Schenck's intentions.

  [In answer to the foregoing letter, Mr. Smith wrote im-

mediately: --

  "For several weeks prior to the adjournment of the General

Assembly, the question of a candidate for governor was generally

discussed, and it was the opinion of all of the best men that

you were the only one who could carry us safely and triumphantly

through the campaign. It was unanimously conceded that if you

would consent to be a candidate you would be nominated with-

out opposition, and so anxious were our Western Reserve friends

to bring this about, they announced in nearly all their papers

that you would receive their support. A few of your friends,

and among them myself, deprecated this movement because we

could not think of sparing you from Congress, and so through

this influence, the thing was checked. However, these men have

waited on us to produce the candidate, and they are becoming

quite uneasy, especially as Washington schemers are involving

the gubernatorial question with that of a candidate for Presi-

dent. Only in this way, on account of the uncertainty about

yourself, has General Schenck's name been mentioned. There-

fore I feel justified in stating that, if it is known that you will

consent to be a candidate, General Schenck will not be. . . .

  "I shall go down to Cincinnati Monday night or Tuesday

morning. This question must be settled by the middle of next

week, or we shall be inevitably lost." . . .]

  MY DARLING:--I reached the depot here about six P. M. yes-

terday, the boys with Rock met me and had me up to the house

in a "jiffy," as Mother used to say. Both the boys laughing and

talking--as tanned as Indians and jolly as porpoises.  Birch

chops and hauls dirt for the road and Webb rows boat and fishes

on the river. School of course but secondary. Their talk was

of chickens.

  The flower garden has more plants in it, and will some day

amount to something. Your verbenas (is that right?) will go

into a star-shaped bed tomorrow.  The rains have brought up the

grass everywhere.  It is a beautiful place.         Birch calls

me "Dad" with great complacency and lays his hand on my

shoulder familiarly.  Have had a pleasant day with the boys.

Very happy little (or big) fellows they are, and very happy it is

to be with them. -- Good night.  Love to all.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I shall probably go to Columbus about the

middle of next week and get around to Fremont from there Fri-

day or Saturday, and will leave with Buckland for Washington

Sunday night or Monday morning. I want to suggest the pro-

priety of taking Birch and Webb with me to Washington.  I shall

stay but a short time. The expense will be a hundred dollars or

so, but as this is probably my last of public life, I would parti-

cularly like to take the boys. Do not speak of it to them unless

you approve.

  I do not regret the new  step [candidacy for governor].

It gets me out of worries that I shall be glad to be rid of.

  All agreeable here. Love to the boys.

  MY DARLING: -- We got here at five this afternoon; had a good

trip. The boys looked and behaved well. At first both a little

subdued, but before we got here Webb recovered and was on good

terms with the Members of Congress on board; in fact, I am

afraid that in another day he would have pulled Senator Chand-

ler's nose and punched Senator Howard in the stomach!  Birch

took to the guidebook and is up on geography, distances, places,

etc., etc.

  DARLING: -- The boys very happy and very good.  Webb and

Birch both crowd up to Mr. Stevens when he speaks. They had

a chance to hear Bingham's best piece of declamation the other

day.  Birch, however, likes Stevens the most.  Webb is very

modest in the House. Birch is bolder. Birch learns everything.

Webb is delighted with books he gets from the library.

  I have some notion of returning by New York. The only

boys. I asked Birch whether he wouldn't prefer going to New

York and Niagara to going direct to Cincinnati.  "No," says he,

"you see I haven't seen Mama for a long time, not since April,

and I want to see where she is living." It looks as if we

could start home the last of this or the first of next week.

  Much love to you, dearest.

                        Affectionately ever,

                                                         R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                             WALNUT HILLS, July 25, 1867.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We got home safely yesterday.  Find Lucy

and all well. I think I will return the two boys about the middle

of next week, or last, not certain yet. If I come up, as I think I

will, I can stay only a couple of days. Politics will be my busi-

ness the rest of the time until election. I feel well about it, and

expect to enjoy it.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.
