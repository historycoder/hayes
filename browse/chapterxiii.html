                           CINCINNATI, November 30, 1858.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We are having delightful weather at last.

Platt visited me last week and I hear today that Mother

or Laura will come down with you from Columbus if you come

that way soon. . . .

  I have wanted to chat with you about some matters of no

great consequence for a few weeks past and hope you will be

down before I am required definitely to act. There is to be a

vacancy in a few weeks on our Common Pleas bench to be

filled by the Governor. The bar will, if I consent, recommend

my appointment with as much unanimity as is ever exhibited by

such bodies. The pay will be either two thousand dollars or

two thousand five hundred dollars a year.  Private reasons

which you are aware of, but which I prefer should not be known

here, incline me strongly in favor of the proposed step. Those

reasons are much strengthened by recent occurrences which I

will mention to you when we meet. The affair is all in the

future as yet, but as I may be required to decide before you

come, I thought I would speak of it.

  My health is better this fall than usual; about work enough

for comfort. . . . . Boys healthy and noisy, noisy espe-

cially, so be prepared.          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                            CINCINNATI, December 9, 1858.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I am in my new office (City Solicitor's office)

and, seeing I was elected only last night, begin to feel much at

home. The berth is a good one. Salary three thousand five

hundred  dollars per year and duties agreeable.      I am  well

spoken of by all the papers. The Commercial of Wednesday

             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          537</B>



and Thursday I suppose you saw. All the Americans, all the

Republicans, and one Democrat voted for me. No one of our

side could get in without that Democratic vote. It was pleasant

all around except that our old friend Caleb [B.] Smith had to

be disappointed. But as I behaved liberally in the premises,

no blame for that attaches to me. This is much better than the

judgeship. Besides, I discovered that the judge appointed by

the Governor only gets fifteen hundred dollars. My present

office is to be filled in four or five months by the people.

  Boys and Lucy all well. We hope to see you soon.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                            CINCINNATI, December 17, 1858.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I had heard from Mother of your illness,

and am glad you are getting well. The weather is now fine

and I hope we shall see you next week. As to our boys, I

agree that it is very desirable to bring them up in the country

as much as possible. They are however very strong and healthy.

Birtie has gained wonderfully. He now looks as if he might

grow up large and heavy.

  The duties of my new office are all in the line of my profes-

sion. The suits of the city, advice to all its officers in legal

matters, etc., etc., occupy my attention. The litigation of a

city like this is very important and of great variety. My as-

sistant will attend to the less important matters, leaving me

free to devote to the leading cases all my time. The amount of

business is not large--at least not too large; not so perplexing,

I think, as my old place.--Let us see you soon.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

              CINCINNATI, December 25 (Christmas), 1858.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I hoped you would be with us today, and

still hope that you will come down before the end of the holi-

days. Our courts are all closed until after New Year's day;









<B>538          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



I am  the only one in the City Buildings this morning.  The

weather is beautiful and everybody happy. Our children are

overflowing with enjoyment of their Christmas presents. It is

a great happiness to observe them. Last evening we had a

jolly time. Our German girls, without our suspecting it, worked

night before last until three o'clock in the morning in the cellar,

and succeeded in surprising us all when we went to supper last

evening, by giving us a beautiful Christmas tree. Birch and

Webb were hardly able to contain themselves. They speedily

got in all the neighbors' little folks and had a capital little im-

promptu frolic. This morning they are again in a happy ex-

citement over the leavings of "Kriss Kringle." I do not think

I ever enjoyed a Christmas so much when I was a little fellow,

as I do now in seeing the happiness of my children.

  It is nine years today since I came to Cincinnati. Many

changes have occurred in that time in the little circle of those

most dear, most of them pleasant ones, but I suppose I shall

never see these happy seasons without shedding a few tears for

the loved one gone!

  I do hope you will come down next week.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

              CINCINNATI, December 25 (Christmas), 1858.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I have just written to Uncle, although I

hope he is with you on his way to visit us. It is a bright lovely

morning in keeping with the happy scenes of the day. Our

children are having more than their share of the happiness. Last

evening our girls surprised and delighted us all with a Christmas

tree which they had prepared by working nearly all the night

before in the cellar. Birch and Webb were as happy as possible.

This morning they are again in a state of excitement with the

gifts of Santa Claus. Birch would like to show them to Ruddy.

He has a genuine man's snare-drum, a sofa, bedstead, musical

instrument, cart and horses, which run by a spring like the

locomotive, "Jack the Giant Killer," "Tom Thumb," and other

books, balls and toys.









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          539</B>



  They were delighted a great deal with one thing which I

mention for Ruddy's benefit. We fixed the locomotive so it

would run in a circle and put one of the little wax candles lighted

in the smoke-stack and darkened the room. It is a pretty sight

to see the little machine with its blazing candle wheeling in a

circle in the dark and delights the little folks hugely.

  It will be six years Thursday since we were married. If you

and Uncle will come down on that day or before it, we will

celebrate it over again.--Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

                                              R.B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.





  December 26, 1858.--Had  a "merry Christmas" yesterday.

Our nice German girls got up a Christmas tree to amuse the

little folks. It delighted them hugely. Birtie is getting to be

a large, fine-looking boy. Is very fond of having me read

stories from his gift books--"Jack the Giant Killer," "Hop o'

my  Thumb," "Aladdin's Lamp,"  and the like.         He  is very

sympathetic, is easily moved to tears when Lucy reads or tells

him such affecting little stories as the "Babes in the Wood."

  Webb is a handsome, lively, wayward, little fellow, two years

and nine months old. Small of his age, short and stout, very

fair complexion (a little waxy red in his cheeks), bright, large,

light blue eyes, flowing, silky, white curls, and a large square

forehead. A little Ben Franklin of a boy, as mischievous as

he can be, always determined to have his own way, persevering

and determined not to give up. Ruddy is six months old, re-

sembles Webb rather than Birtie, a laughing, bright-eyed baby,

promises well; has colic still often. Webb and Ruddy are like

the Birchard side of my house. Birch, we think, is getting more

and more like his uncle Joe. A very happy family we are.

  It is nine years since I came to Cincinnati, and six years

since I married. Both good steps. I am now fairly established

as a lawyer--with a good reputation and flattering prospects.

About three weeks ago I was elected City Solicitor in place of

Judge Hart. It is for his unexpired term of four months. I think









<B>540          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



the office a very desirable one; salary sufficient--three thousand

five hundred dollars, and duties agreeable.





                            CINCINNATI, December 31, 1858.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I am sorry to learn by your last that we are

not to see you during these jolly holidays. It however will make

but little difference if you come soon enough to spend a part of

the winter with us.

  A notice of dissolution between myself and Corwine will ap-

pear tomorrow. I ought to get out of the concern several thou-

sand dollars, but it is by no means certain that I shall more than

two or three and possibly not that much. However, ending as

it does, I am a gainer by having formed the connection. I leave

it with such a position as will insure me a fair living practice

either alone or otherwise.

  Rogers is here. He will remain during the most of the winter.

                          Sincerely,

                               R.B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                             CINCINNATI, January 14, 1859.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . .  I notice what you say as to look-

ing out for what is due me in our firm. I shall do my best. The

most of it is in a condition not to be lost by my neglect. Nine

thousand dollars is in a judgment in the name of Rogers and my-

self in Kentucky; four thousand dollars in suit; two thousand five

hundred dollars in a single claim in my charge; so that if I lose,

it will be rather from the nature of the claims than anything else.

My share of the three large claims above is six thousand dollars.

As to small claims I shall keep my eye on them as much as

possible.

                         Sincerely,

                               R.B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                                 CINCINNATI, April 5, 1859.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I hope you are not cast down about the

election here. It will, I hope, not prove my ruin. Tell William









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          541</B>



our treasurer got in by about four hundred majority; our mayor

has nineteen hundred majority; I have twenty-two hundred.

A good time for unpopular men when the majorities are so

great.--Lucy and all very well.

                        Affectionately,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



  June 19, 1859.--On Wednesday, June 8, our boys were bap-

tized in our own parlor. Present, Mother Hayes, Mother Webb,

Dr. James Webb, (Aunt Clara, Eliza, Jane, and Mary, servants,

colored), Lucy and myself. [The boys were christened] Birchard,

James Webb, and Rutherford Platt. Dr. Clark of the Methodist

church performed the ceremony. The boys all behaved well.

Webb after it was over asked, "What did the gentleman put

water on my head for?" The boys are all fine little fellows. Birch

is tall, slender, with fine eyes, a great quantity of hair, talks a

great deal--hitting on words that rhyme often; is learning to

whistle, and goes about whistling constantly. Webb is short,

stout, bright, and mischievous; very resolute and wilful, modest

--very modest; never gives up a purpose; exceedingly affec-

tionate,--when asked who[m] he loves, says, "All the people,"

and if asked who[m] best, says "Barchie." Little Ruddy is

pretty; blue eyes, fair skin; looks like Webb and promises to be

like him in disposition.



                       FREMONT, July 1, 1859. Friday A. M.

  DEAR L--:--We reached here last night in good condition,

and as it was ten o'clock we stopped with Father Kessler. Birch

has been a good boy--is a very agreeable travelling companion.

I am writing in the bank. Uncle has not yet got down. He is

very well.

         . . . . At Kenyon everything looked as pretty as possible.

Dr. Little and Carrie went up with us from Columbus but on

commencement morning they received a dispatch that one of

their little folks had the scarlet fever and they went home im-

mediately. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were there. Mrs. Campbell









<B>542          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



looked young and pretty. Mrs. Solis and Jennie Andrews stopped

at Profesor Smith's (my quarters also) where we had an agree-

able company. There were two boys a little older than Birch.

They kept Birtie in employment with a large rocking-horse and

firecrackers. Uncle Billy [William K. Rogers] is tolerably well

but thinner than ever.

  I hope you are well. This pleasant change in the weather

extends, I suppose, to Cincinnati. It will, I hope, agree with you

as well as it does with me. . . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                  CINCINNATI, July 23, 1859.

  DEAR MOTHER:--. . . .  I too thought constantly on the

16th, 17th, and 18th of the sad event of three years before. I

can't write or talk much of such griefs, but I suppose I feel them

as deeply as others do. Fanny was a lovely character, and all

reveries about her contain pleasant as well as mournful reflec-

tions.--Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                            CINCINNATI, September 1O, 1859.

  DEAR GUY:--It is a long while since I have heard from you or

written to you. I have thought of you often, as often as ever,

and take as great an interest as ever in you and yours. We are

sorry not to have seen you and your wife before you left for the

South in the spring. This will not, I hope, be the last of you in

Washington. I do not question your sincerity when you express

disgust with political life at Washington. No doubt its dark

side is dark enough; yet that ought not to drive from the public

service good men whose tastes, opportunities, and abilities point

[them] out as fitted for public station.

  How is your wife? How are you living? Write me of all

your affairs; how is Stephen and your older brothers? Uncle

Birchard spent a good deal of the winter and spring with me. He

often talks of you all. He has tolerable health now and does









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          543</B>



not change rapidly. He has joined the Presbyterian Church and

is largely interested in church and religious matters. He is free

from all sectarianism and bigotry, takes cheerful and hopeful

views of things, and is as clear of all that is disagreeable in

many persons who are religiously inclined, as any one I ever

knew. He is a happier and, perhaps, a better man.

  My wife and boys are my world, and occupy all my time, or

nearly all, which is not given to business. Outside of my pro-

fession, I read occasionally a good book, and keep a general run

of politics. This summer I made a trip with Birtie to Kenyon.

Rogers is there studying theology. I staid with Julia Buttles

Smith.  Mrs. Solis (Harriet Platt), Lizzie Campbell  (Little)

and Dr. John Little were all there pleasantly reminding me of old

times. I have also during the vacation of the courts made a

pleasure trip East and to Mammoth Cave.

  I do not know what part you took in the late contest for

Governor in Texas; but supposing you entertain your former

notions about General Houston we probably agree in feeling sorry

that the Old Humbug has again risen to the surface. It may be

regarded as a proper rounding off of his chequered career by

lovers of the romantic, but in any other view it is not agreeable

to contemplate.

  Douglas was here and spoke last night. It is supposed by

most of his friends that the South will consent to his nomination

at Charleston, and if so his chance of winning the Presidency

seems very good. His last expression of his views in Harper's

certainly strengthens him in the North.

  Write to me.--As ever,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.





  October 2, 1859.--We have been absent from our own house

a good part of the summer, having an addition made to it. A

third story has been put on to the back part, a brick kitchen,

three stories, for wash-room, girls' room, [and] bathroom. We

are now at home again, and the painting, papering, brushing up,









<B>544          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and the like, nearly completed. In the kitchen we have a range

which thus far does well, and other conveniences. Birch has

been absent with his grandmother since July 30. I long to see

him. Webb is healthy, stout, short, and noisy. Very good-

tempered and lively. It is delightful to see him galloping along,

with his bright wavy hair rising and falling as he leaps. He

talks a great deal, utterly regardless of grammar and pronuncia-

tion. The baby, Ruddy, is fat, lively and lovable. Very resolute;

speaks a few words; but can only walk by holding on to a chair

or some other object.

  October 23, 1859.--Several years ago, in 1852, I think, I

caught a severe cold which I did not get rid of for several weeks.

During the time I had it I tried the Nancy Farrer case--the trial

occupying nearly two weeks, and requiring a great deal of ex-

ertion of voice in examining a host of witnesses, arguing incidental

questions and addressing the jury. I thought at the time that my

lungs, the lung on the right side especially, was [were] somewhat

injured. Occasionally since I have felt a weakness, nothing that

could be called pain, under the lower ribs on the right side. A

little exertion in speaking seems to bring on this feeling. It is

near the point on the right side where my body touches the table

or desk when I write, as I usually do, with my right side towards

the table. I have felt the same weakness increased after long

writing. I suspect it is caused quite as much by writing as by

colds or speaking. I now write about it to preserve the dates

when I have most felt it and to write a couple of rules or cautions

for my future conduct, viz.:

  (1) To write either facing my desk or table or with my left

side towards it.

  (2) To form the habit of speaking without much exertion

of voice.

  I may add a third: If I ever find speaking or writing injuring

me, to discontinue it until I am again sound.

  In 1852 this weakness first came to my notice; repeated once

or twice since; and now again in a way to occasion me a slight

uneasiness.









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          545</B>



  November 6, 1859.--Birchie was six years old on Friday, the

4th. Mr. and Mrs. Warren, Herron, and Stephenson dined with

us.  Birtie received a number of presents--some blocks for a

three-story house, and books. He is beginning to learn to spell

and of his own motion "takes to larnin'." The other boys im-

prove finely. Little Ruddy is growing fast. We think he will

be larger than Webb, who is very small, and stronger than Birch.







                             CINCINNATI, December 2, 1859.

  DEAR MOTHER:--. . . . Our visit to Fremont was an

exceedingly pleasant one.  Uncle was  in good health.  Mrs.

Valette better than usual.  Mr. and Mrs. Pettibone were there on

Thanksgiving day from Wisconsin. Lucy took tea at Mrs. Tay-

lor's. Her family all well. Mr. and Mrs. McLelland and Platt

Brush and his wife spent one evening at Mrs. Valette's with us.

We took Webb. He liked it much. All the relations well ex-

cept Pease.  He is not able to sit up much of the time.  His

spirits are good. He may live a good while. I think he will

last through the winter, although his death at any time would

not surprise me. He is as happy and cheerful as you could

expect one to be under such circumstances.

  Uncle's new house [in Spiegel Grove--the older portion of

the present house] is large and very handsome. Not too large. It

is just such a house as I would prefer to live in. He has taken

a great deal of pains with it, and has in every respect been for-

tunate. There will be no expensive work, no merely ornamental

work about it. Lucy was very much taken with it. I suspect she

will prefer it to a city home, after she once gets settled there.

It is not quite certain whether it will be ready to occupy early

next summer or not.

  I have been very busy since my return or I would have written

before. Love to all.

                          Affectionately,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

<B>546          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  December 17, 1859.--We (Lucy and self) took with us Webb

to Fremont Thanksgiving day, the 25th of last month. Had a

happy time at Mrs. Valette's. Uncle uncommonly well for him.

The saddest thing is Pease's hopeless sickness. He is dying of

consumption. Talks pleasantly, is clear-headed and natural;

feels that one ought not to die, when bones, muscles, and brain

are all so sound, but is perfectly aware that there is no hope.

When we parted he said, "Oh, we may meet a hundred times

yet." What good friends we have been since I was a boy, since

1835--almost twenty-five years. It is hard to see him go. We

shall meet again, I hope, before the great change.

  Have read "Recollections of Choate" this week. He was a

"remarkable" man, as Dickens says so many Americans are. 1

have heard him pour out in impetuous torrents his warm and

wordy eloquence. It was no doubt most effective in compelling

verdicts from juries, but never struck me as "high art" or (the

real thing) genuine nature. His best production, "Eulogy on

Webster," at Dartmouth, is very beautiful. The lesson of his

life, that is, the best suggestion one gets from it, is the importance

and value of perpetual and preserving labor in any direction

which one's judgment selects. "Diction," verbiage, was his idol.

He sacrificed pleasure, health, all, to it. Well, it is important.

Western lawyers, Cincinnati lawyers, do neglect too much what is

termed learning, scholarship. Let me read and reread the best

poets, as Shakespeare, Milton, Byron; the model prose writers or

speakers rather, as Burke [and] Webster. Addison does not

interest me. He is smooth but, to me, dull.

  Choate, if this book contains his best, was not equal to Corwin

or Judge Johnson in wit, in shrewd and telling remark, in anec-

dote, or illustration. With vastly more reading and scholarship

than Judge Johnson, with more magnetic power, with warmth

and enthusiasm, he was not equal to the judge in brains; not

equal in illustration, in wit, or in shrewd mastery of the

prejudices and biases of juries. Judge [Johnson] as a thinker, as

a man of intellect, is far his superior.

  Choate wrote a great deal; did not, it is said, commit his

speeches to memory, but wrote them before he spoke. Benton,

it is said, prepared for his greater efforts in the same way. It









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          547</B>



must be useful to write and rewrite such portions of a speech

or argument as require precision, and such parts as are intended

to be "fine"--the statement of propositions and the rhetorical

parts of an argument.

  Dr. Boynton in one of his popular lectures on geology described

the first and lowest forms of animal life of which fossil-

ized remains are to be found in the crust of the earth. He showed

that science teaches on this subject two facts of sound importance

in our day, which general observation tends strongly to confirm.

One is, that the animals of the early geological periods, and which

exist only as fossils, were far inferior in structure and organ-

ization to the living animals of our own times, showing that

fossils are not the favorites of the Creator; and the other fact

is, that the lowest and meanest animals to be found either on the

earth or in its crust, fitted only to crawl and wriggle in mud and

slime, are those which the Creator has organized with the great

primal defect of having no backbones!

  Among the expenses of the American Revolutionary War

which the British government laid before Parliament, one of the

items was  "five gross of scalping-knives."--Buckle, p. 344.

  December 24, 1859.--Christmas eve. Ten years ago tonight

came to Cincinnati. Arrived at Pearl Street House about 9:30 P.

M., a cold clear night, a stranger seeking "room" among the

brethren of the greenbag. Without any extraordinary success,

without that sort of success which makes men giddy sometimes,

I have nevertheless found what I sought, a respectable place.

Good. . . . .

  December 26, 1859.--Birtie and Webb both have measles--

both light as yet, and Birtie probably past the worst. They both

lie in the same bed in their grandma's room. A red, bladder-like

balloon, a present of Uncle Joe's, floating against the ceiling

in their sight, and other presents near them. . . . .

  January 5, 1860.--On Monday cousin John Rutherford Pease

died at Fremont of consumption. We roomed together at Cap-

tain Thompson's in Fremont from the spring of 1845, when I

first opened a lawyer's office, until he married his second wife

about [the last of October], 1848, a period of [considerably









<B>548          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



more than three] years. What a friendly man he was! In-

different to the welfare of mankind in the mass, thinking

that common men were to be used by their superiors in intel-

lect, he was yet kind to all, and true as steel to the few select

friends whom he loved; disposed to think well of his blood rela-

tives, and ready and glad to aid them. He had a noble head,

large, round forehead, developed like a promontory, of the sort

Judge Johnson calls Doric. He was gifted by nature with the

best intellect of any of the Hayes family. Could play perfectly

chequers, chess, cards, etc.; was an ardent, unhesitating party

man--Democrat; had no literary culture, could not write or

speak grammatically, but knew the things which ought to be done

in any exigency, and recognized and appreciated the best things

in literature.  He was physically timid--not decidedly so--but

cautious, full of good anecdotes and fond of humor; excelled in

ridicule.

  Speaking of religion, he was an orthodox Episcopalian in senti-

ment to the general ear; but in his private sentiments, a skeptic.

His only fear of the future was annihilation or loss of personal

identity. Did not shrink from death but would greatly prefer

to live longer. After learning from Uncle that he could last

only a few days, I resolved to write him and say two things--

how much I valued and loved him, and how confident I was that

in the future he would share the fate of my dear sister Fanny.

He would have considered that, as I do, the best fortune that

any one can hope for. Dear, dear friend, hail and farewell!





                               CINCINNATI, January 5, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I heard of Pease's death yesterday at Colum-

bus. As I was going to the depot, I met General Bell, Haynes,

and John L. Greene, and asked them how Pease was and learned

[of] his death for the first time. I left home before your letter

and McLelland's dispatch were received. It is just as well; I

might have gone up to the funeral, but it is all over. I feared

from your last letter that he would not last long. He has been a

great happiness to us--a good friend--a delightful companion.

I did intend to write to him a few last words of friendship, and to









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR -- CINCINNATI, 1850-1860          549</B>



say what I thought of his future.  I am too late -- but it is as

well.  We shall remember him as he would prefer to be remem-

bered.

   The boys are getting well as fast as need be.  The little one is

just getting sick.  No doubt he will get through as his brothers

have.  Mother is in better health than usual.

                  Sincerely,

                                      R. B. HAYES.

   Sunday, January 15, 1860.--- Little Ruddy has been very sick

--the effect of measles;  is today decidedly better.  His lungs

are easily affected.  He is in temperament, etc., midway between

Birch and Webb--smarter than either, his grandmother says.

Glad he is getting well.

   DEAR UNCLE:-- I received your letter today. . . . . I

was gratified with Otis' letter about Pease.  I felt hurt that the

Democrat should have had no notice of his death except the

ordinary naked announcement of the fact.  You must miss him

greatly.  If Ruddy gets well enough, Lucy will go to Columbus;

otherwise, of course, not.  I had an excellent letter today from

Laura.  She describes her Vermont vacation visit as a very happy

one.  Mead and girls and boys with Laura dined at Uncle Aus-

tin's.  Had a good jolly visit.  We are all well except the baby.

You must come down soon.  You will find us uncommonly happy

and good-natured.

                     Sincerely,

                                        R. B. HAYES.

                              CINCINNATI, January 29, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . . We  have had a lively time, full

of excitement and interest for the boys, and men too, for that

matter, receiving the official visits of Kentucky and Tennessee.

All passed off agreeably. If no good was done, it is quite certain

that very little harm was done. It is about time we were getting

our winter visit from you.  Can't you come soon? . . . .

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

                              CINCINNATI, January 30, 1860.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I have just read your good long letter.  I

sympathize fully with your feelings in regard to the old homes

with which so many associations of your younger days are con-

nected. I hope the Bancrofts are not to be left without any home

of their own in their old age. The loss is sad enough, even if

they have the means to provide a new one. It is pleasant to

know that Laura finds so much pleasure among her Yankee

relatives. Uncle writes cheerfully, and is in pretty good health.

Our Birch and Webb are getting over the effects of measles, and

are almost as rugged and noisy as ever. Little Ruddy is still

weak and pale. Can't walk or creep at all. We hope he will

get along better this fine weather.

  We, too, had a great demonstration on the occasion of the visit

from the Kentucky and Tennessee authorities. The great pro-

cession passed our house, much to the delight of the boys. Our

house was adorned with flags and portraits of Jackson and Clay,

in all which the little folks were more concerned than the older

children. All passed off to the satisfaction of the city and the

strangers. Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  February 4, 1860.--If some Boswell would collect the good

things of Judge Johnson they would excel in quantity and quality









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          551</B>



the witty and pithy sayings of [Rufus] Choate or [George D.]

Prentice. A new one yesterday. Of E. P. Norton, a waiter

upon notabilities, he says Shakespeare's saying should be worded:

"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some thrust

themselves upon greatness."





                             CINCINNATI, February 4, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . . You ask what I am doing.  Not

working hard--not working much. I earn my salary, I am sure,

and am therefore conscience clear. I have read a good deal this

winter--more than usual; some history, some poetry, some

religion, biography, and miscellaneous matters, but no novels and

no politics. I am intending to go into politics and novels as soon

as I finish three or four books that I have now on hand.

  I never enjoyed life better.  Barring two or three anxious

weeks on the boys' accounts, this has been a happy winter--

very. Lucy is in finer feather than she has been for two or three

years. We want you to come down and are sorry to hear that

sickness has kept you at home. The weather is fine again and

we hope to see you soon.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                             CINCINNATI, February 7, 1860.

  DEAR GUY:--I am very glad to hear of your good fortune.

Me and my wife send congratulations to you and your wife--

our boys to your boy. Not done in the best of English, but the

sentiment is sound and the good wish sincere. I am glad to hear

from you once more.

  George [Jones] and myself held a class meeting, or, if it is

more in your line, a caucus, over your long silence a few weeks

ago; and we began to fear that the deadening effect of long

separation, added to intensity of political separation, had ended

our correspondence. You are the only college friend from whom

even an occasional letter or reminder is to be expected. All the

rest have drifted off into unbroken silence.









<B>552          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I like Galveston as a home with a summer retreat from the

fever. Ladies and gentlemen getting respectable, if not venerable,

prefer, I find, a city; but children ought to be in the country.

We hope to enjoy both conditions hereafter. Uncle has nearly

finished a beautiful residence in a fine grove about a mile from

Fremont, which is to be our home in summer.

  You know we have three boys, the youngest nearly two--the

eldest "going on seven." All fine boys, of course, and, what is

not so fine, they are all just getting well of the measles. They

have had (the two oldest) all the other baby complaints except

the scourge of this climate, scarlet fever, and that we hope to

escape.

  Uncle is in usual health. Matthews, of Columbus, Buttles, and

Case are all doing as well as ever;--Buttles better than usual.

He is a church member and nearly rid of his insane appetite, it

is thought. Dr. Little, as usual. George [Jones] is East buying

stock (goods). The doctor (Webb) is with me; still a bachelor

-and the best nurse and boy amuser living.  I would recom-

mend you and your wife, if there are any bachelor brothers, to

cultivate them with increased affection.  They are so useful

when you have had enough boy,--and that time comes occa-

sionally, your will find, strange as it may now seem.  But these

little ones are a great comfort. No doubt you will so find it.

The precious little Guy, I hope he will be healthy and a living

happiness to you all these many, many years.

                          As ever,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                            CINCINNATI, February 28, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . . As to the railroad bonds.  The

case at Columbus has been argued, but will not be decided for

three or four weeks. But as I told you some time ago, bonds

like yours--that is, first mortgage bonds, not exceeding  ten

thousand dollars a mile, on the C. & T. R. R.--are in my opinion,

perfectly secured under any decision that will be made. I do

not wish other people to act on my judgment, but so far as you









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          553</B>



are concerned, unless I am misinformed as to facts, I do not

hesitate in giving this as my advice. . . . .

                            Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  February 28, 1860.--The bell just tolled eleven or twelve

o'clock at night. Kept up reading Bulwer's "What will He do

with It?" This carries me back--sitting up to finish a novel!

Years ago, fifteen or twenty, I did it often, but not lately. Wife

and Webb away at Columbus.



                                 CINCINNATI, April 5, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I have just read the decision in the railroad

mortgage case at Columbus. It is, substantially, upon every

important point, precisely what I have always told you I thought

it would be. In one respect it secures the holder of a few bonds

against combinations on the part of the large creditors in a way

that had not occurred to me. It requires the railroad to be sold

for two-thirds of an appraisement made in the usual way. Your

C. & T. R. R. would never be appraised at less than two million

dollars or three million dollars. It would be more likely to be

four million dollars. So it is certain to sell for enough to pay

the mortgages you are interested in fully. We are all well.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  April 11, 1860.--Birch and Webb often discuss deep ques-

tions touching God, death, a future state, and the like. Birch is

reverent and orthodox in his views; Webb is inquiring and by no

means as serious as would seem proper. The other day in a

thunderstorm they fell into a conversation on the cause of

lightning. Birch said God did it. Webb interrupted, "Does God

make the elephants?" "Yes, Webby."--"Well, how does he get

them down?" puts in Webb. "Oh," says Birch, "there are a









<B>554          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



great many  things about God that we can't understand."--

"Well, but," said Webb, "who made God?"  "Webby," said

Birch very seriously, "that is one of the things we can't under-

stand. We shall know about that when we die and go to

Heaven."



                                CINCINNATI, April 11, 1860.

  DEAR  UNCLE:--I heard from you today.  I hope your

house arrangements have not caused you much trouble.  We are

quite able to get through the summer comfortably, and  would

prefer you should not be hurried. I will try to visit you during

the next three or four weeks and stay a few days, when we can

talk up all matters. I have talked with Judge Gholson about his

railroad decision. It unquestionably gives perfect security to all

first mortgages on all important railroads.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R.B. HAYES

  April 15, 1860.--I have just finished reading the first two

volumes of Carlyle's "Frederick the Great." It is an entertaining

book.  Carlyle admires the doers rather than the talkers of the

world. He loves earnest, truthful, brave men. "Veracity" is his

pet word of praise.  He says: "Nobody in these days has the

least notion of the sinful waste there is in talk, whether by pen

or tongue."

  I have read Burnet's notes lately. In early times a code of

rules to govern the settlers here was adopted in town meeting

about 1791. Where are they? William McMillan was judge, and

received injuries which caused his death some years after in con-

sequence of an attempt to arrest him by the military com-

mandant of the fort for acting as judge.



                       COLUMBUS, April 22, (Sunday) 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I came up with mother Webb yesterday and

shall return tomorrow. The grandmothers I shall leave together









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          555</B>



about a week. . . . . We came up by the pleasant new



route. Since the contract of consolidation, as it is called, between

the Hamilton & Dayton and the Little Miami Railroad com-

panies, the middle of the day express train, between Cincinnati

and Columbus, is run by the way of Xenia and Dayton without

change of cars. The time is about fifteen minutes longer than the

direct route, and is some twelve or fifteen miles greater distance;

but this is more than made up by the fine country, and the greater

convenience of the Hamilton & Dayton depot as the starting

and landing point. Mother Webb and I walked down to the

depot at 10 o'clock in the morning, and were set down at Platt's

at about 3 o'clock P.M.--really a gain in time from our house

over the old route. The return is still better, as it avoids the

delay at the Little Miami depot, which you dislike so much.

  I expect to have a good deal of leisure during a month to come,

and shall probably visit you some Sunday soon.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . .  Our delegates have left for Chi-

cago. After Chase, they will prefer Wade, Fremont, or some

such candidate--anyone named before Seward.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                                CINCINNATI, May 23, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We are all very well; have escaped the hurri-

cane and floods without injury. Mother Webb was on a railroad

train going to Lexington the afternoon of the great blow--the

train ran over a tree causing alarm, but no injury to passengers.



  Lincoln you are, of course, pleased with. He takes well here.

All well at Columbus.

                            Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

<B>556          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  June --, 1860.--A spring of storms; wind prodigious, rains

unprecedented. May 21, a wind swept over Ohio and Kentucky,

about one hundred miles wide by three hundred long, at the rate

of eighty to one hundred miles an hour, unroofing houses in

Louisville, Lexington, Cincinnati, Xenia, Chillicothe, Portsmouth,

Marietta.  Probably twenty lives lost in the towns named.  Since,

storms in several places equally severe but not so extensive. A

much severer one at the West June 4. Many lives lost. Rain

on Sycamore street one inch an hour proved too much for the

sewers and filled houses and cellars.



                                 CINCINNATI, June 11, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--The city "speaking apparatus" is again in

session. The street railroads want to get rid of their contract to

pay one cent for every passenger carried, into the City Treasury.

This is about three thousand dollars a month from the railroads

now in operation. This is worth fighting about, and there is a

good deal of hubbub about it.

  Mother came down on Friday. She is in good health and

spirits, and will stay some time with us.  One thing I am in doubt

about. She really seems to think she would like to go to Ver-

mont. I fear it would interfere a good deal with our plans, but

if it is likely that it would be best for her to go, we will modify

our plans. If I had time at my command, I would certainly in-

sist upon trying to gratify her. The difficulty is, our time will

hardly allow us to travel, except railroad fashion--night and

day. What do you think of it?

  I have called several times to see Mr. Austin, but have not

found him at home. From all I can learn from others, I have

no doubt you are right as to his innocence of all connection with

the attempt to smuggle powder. Neither he nor his partner was

in the city, if my information is correct. I shall try to see him,

for if the facts are as I believe, the public ought to know it.

  By the by, if nothing prevents, I will come up and talk over

my trip with you next Sunday, or the Sunday after.

                            Sincerely,

             R.B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          557</B>



  June 24, 1860.--Yesterday the Democrats put in nomination

two tickets at Baltimore. Douglas and Fitzpatrick were nomi-

nated by the Northern wing and Breckinridge and Lane by the

Southern. Lincoln and Hamlin, nominated by the Republican

party, and Bell and Everett, candidates of the "Union" party,

have been in the field several weeks. Four tickets for national

offices. This is new in my day. My Republican friends are

confident that Lincoln and Hamlin will be elected by the people.

I have a good deal of apprehension on the subject. I fear the

election will go to the House. Let me cipher. There are three

hundred and three electoral votes; one hundred and fifty-two

are required for a choice. We may count for Lincoln the States

carried by Fremont in 1856--eleven States, one hundred and

fourteen electoral votes.  Add  Minnesota four, one hundred

and  eighteen certain.   Pennsylvania, probably,  twenty-seven,

Oregon, probably, three--one hundred and forty-eight.  Four

more votes are necessary to elect him. If California, New Jersey,

Illinois, or Indiana should go for Lincoln, the vote of either State

added to one hundred and forty-eight would elect. But all the

following States should, perhaps, be counted doubtful. I will

append my view of the chances.

  New Jersey (7), Pennsylvania (27), Oregon (4?), Illinois

(11), doubtful, but probably for Lincoln. Their vote added to

that of the Fremont States would give Lincoln a total of 167

votes.

  Indiana (13), California (4), Missouri (9), Delaware (3),

doubtful, but probably for Douglas--29 votes.

  Certain for Bell, Kentucky (12), Tennessee (13), Louisiana

(6), Maryland (8).  Doubtful, but probably for Bell, Virginia

(15), North Carolina (10).  A total of 64 votes.

  Certain for Breckinridge, Alabama (9), Arkansas (4), Florida

(3), Georgia (10), Mississippi (7), South Carolina (8), Texas

(4). A total of 45 votes.

  Lincoln's chance in New Jersey depends on having a small

defection in favor of Bell, and an equal or larger defection from

Douglas. The same in other States. That is, Douglas will carry

almost the whole Democratic vote in all the Northwestern States

I think certain. I estimate the defection from him to Breckin-









<B>558          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ridge as follows: In Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut,

three to five thousand each; in Indiana, five to eight thousand;

in Pennsylvania, twenty to thirty thousand; in New York,

thirty to forty thousand.

  On the whole I think Lincoln's chance the best, but not a

moral certainty; that Bell or Breckinridge will be next. All this

is on the supposition that Breckinridge will remain a candidate.

His withdrawal would change the programme toto coelo.





                                 CINCINNATI, June 29, 1860.

  DEAREST L--:-- Thank you for the nice little letter.  We were

getting fussy about you. Always will if we don't hear often.

One of you is, of course (!) of small moment but then you three

make a void about home--especially at mealtimes, going-to-bed

times, etc., etc. We do feel alone without you, but we'll be good

and patient if you will write frequently.

  Mother Webb  is much better--calls herself perfect again.

Webb sleeps with Uncle Joe--is a marvellously good boy; takes

teaching from his Grandma Hayes. Last night he rode the cir-

cuit with me on top of the street cars. . . . .

  The Fourth of July has broke out in the usual way--the

symptoms more violent than last year. Webb seems to think it is

his birthday and that the flags and uproar have some personal

reference to himself; insists on firecrackers, torpedoes, and the

like in great quantities.

                       Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                 CINCINNATI, July 2, 1860.

  DEAREST L--:--. . . . You need not feel anxious about

any of us.  Mother Webb is better than when you left--not

perfectly well by any means but improving and in very good

spirits.

  The failure of Dr. James is not a matter to mourn, and none

of us so feel it. He preferred a re-election, but I much doubt if

it was really desirable. He has got out of the place about all









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          559</B>



the good there was in it, and his re-election would I really think

have done him more mischief than benefit. Dr. Joe and his

mother so regard it and have no feeling on the subject. There

was nothing in the manner of the thing worth noticing. There

was a division among the commissioners, no two agreed on the

same candidate. The mayor voted for Dr. James, the auditor

supported him a part of the time, but no two happened to vote

at the same time for him. The argument of a needy family

was the point in favor of his competitors. I would not have

said so much about it, but you seem to have a good deal of

trouble about it and I write to relieve it. It has not been men-

tioned or thought of by any of us for the last four or five days.

He made six dollars the day after he left the office. . . . .

                       Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                 CINCINNATI, July 5, 1860.

  DEAREST L--:--The Fourth of July is over and we have

escaped. None even of our particular friends have been seriously

injured. As at this writing I have received no dispatch from you,

I suppose you also are all safe. Many eyes and limbs must have

been lost, but we do not know the particulars. The New York

Observer will be full of it the next few weeks.

  I devoted myself to Webb all day. He took to torpedoes at the

first introduction, but was shy of crackers. I succeeded in con-

quering his fears and he became as fond of it as ever Birch was.

At night Mr. Wilson and others had fireworks which even Mother

Hayes approved of.

  I spent the evening in a jolly, sensible way at the Club--got

home sober at 1:45 P. M. [A. M.] Felt lonely without you, and

ruminated how loving and confidential I would be if you were

only with me. There is one side of my nature which is not seen

at all times, which I sometimes think you do not know, a sen-

sibility to saddening influences, giving rise to very strong emo-

tions, when the requisite exciting causes are at work. A meet-

ing of old friends, when some dear ones are absent, possibly

dead, the occurrence of happy or sad anniversaries. I was yes-









<B>560          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



terday happy enough, and yet it was a sad anniversary. Four

years ago I was all day with Fanny, hardly expecting her to live

out the day. She died after I came home on the 16th.

  There was a long beautiful, jovial letter read last night from

George Strong, full of pat allusions to old times and friends now

gone or scattered, waking up slumbering trains of associations

which filled me full almost to overflowing. We are passing on

to the downhill side. We ought to be and shall be dearer and

dearer to each other. The affections scattered among so many

who are gone or going should and naturally will concentre on

each other, if we are true and good. One [member] recited the

affecting piece, "Twenty Years Ago, Tom." I had no sweethearts

in my schoolboy days, as Tom and his schoolmates had. No

sunnier face shines in my memory than the one I saw first about

thirteen years ago in the little cottage above the spring [at Dela-

ware] and which so often since has rested on my shoulder im-

parting comfort and joy always.

  Love to all and kisses for the dear boys. . . . .

                         Affectionately,

                                                     R. B. H.

  George Strong said: "I hear the Club has grown dignified and

orderly. Oh, don't. I long for the good old days when we called

the President, not Mr. President, but Rud or Billy."

  MRS. HAYES.

                                  CINCINNATI, July 21, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I ought to have written to you some days ago.

I went to Columbus a week ago--remained over Sunday and re-

turned with Lucy and little Babes Monday. Laura is in fine

health, happy and cheerful--looks and acts more like her mother

than ever before. Is improved in appearance and manners, but

not greatly changed. I doubt about Platt's marrying again.

Nothing said on the subject. Mother will return as soon as Mrs.

Solis' visit is over at Platt's--say in about two weeks.  Lucy and

I will start on the first of August, or within two or three days of

that time, if nothing prevents. We shall probably go by way

of Toledo and Detroit, and on our old route to Quebec, thence









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          561</B>



by railroad across to the northern part of New Hampshire, and

down the Connecticut River to Brattleboro. Possibly you can

meet us at Toledo, but do not put yourself out of the way to do

so. We would like it if you could go on with us. I have hunted

up two or three outside places to go to, of a good deal of interest.

  We are all very well. . . . .

                            Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  July 22, 1860.--Mother Hayes is here and tells me the follow-

ing particulars about her parents. Her father, Roger Birchard,

was born in Connecticut, emigrated to Vermont, died at Saratoga

on a visit for health 1806, and was buried there; aged about

forty-five. He was a country retail merchant at Wilmington,

Vermont. His father, Elias Birchard, was a farmer in Mansfield,

Tolland County, Connecticut. The brothers of my grandfather

Birchard were Amasa B., of Paris, New York, Israel B., of

Canandaigua. Mother's mother was Drusilla Austin, a daughter

of Daniel Austin, of Suffield, Hartford County, Connecticut, a

Revolutionary soldier, a captain under Washington. Daniel Aus-

tin, of Philadelphia, Cyrus A., of New York, and Linus A., of

Ohio, were grandmother Birchard's brothers. There were five

daughters,  all with  families.   Rowe,  Smith,  and  Debart.

Mother's grandfather was Daniel Austin and probably also Elias

Birchard. The Birchards are of French extraction--Huguenots.

[Their ancestor] took refuge in England, married an English

woman.

  July 31, 1860.--Day after tomorrow Lucy and I start on a

four weeks' trip to see the cities and scenery of the East.

Montreal, Quebec, and the ocean lie in our route. We anticipate

much pleasure. The children we leave with their Grandma Webb

and Uncle Joe. May we all get again together happy and well

as we now are

                          CINCINNATI, September 2, 1860.

                                           Sunday morning.

  DEAR MOTHER:--We reached home last night and found all

here in their usual health.  We  returned by way of Cleveland

and Fremont. We stopped two days at Fremont and enjoyed our

visit with Uncle quite as much as we did any part of our trip.

He is getting on very well with his house and except a cold is in

good health.

  I saw a great many who inquired after you and sent af-

fectionate words of remembrance. Aunts Emily, Martha, Ban-

croft, Aunt Noyes, and many more. I found Uncles Austin

and Roger both well and in good spirits. The visits to the dif-

ferent families of relatives were all pleasant enough. We were

at Granby, Chesterfield, and saw Aunt Noyes and John.

  Lucy got tired of the sight-seeing in the cities and we came

home a few days sooner on that account. . . . . We are

glad to get home. Our trip was in every respect a fortunate

one but we had enough of it. I will sometime talk over the

interesting parts of it with you.--Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                            CINCINNATI, September 8, 1860.

  DEAR MOTHER:--We are glad to hear you are so well. If

you knew the various ups and downs of our long trip, you would

have even greater reason to feel glad that you did not attempt

it than you now have. As I have told you, we enjoyed our jour-

ney as much as we expected--perhaps more. It was really a

great happiness. But we are [were] out in steamboats in two

storms--one on the ocean between Portland and Boston, and

one in a still worse place, the lower St. Lawrence, when the tide

was rushing like a torrent; lost one anchor, ran on a rock, were

between two or three days in a fog in the midst of rocks. And,

worse than all for a civilized being, we were three nights in

sleeping cars. I had rather risk a shipwreck than a sleeping car.

We rode nearly twenty-five hundred miles by railroad. Now,

this you could not have endured. Seeing New England and the









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          563</B>



relatives with nothing else in view, you would enjoy, and I hope

you may do it yet.

  Uncles Austin and Roger are but little changed and would be

glad to see you.  Aunt Bancroft is a fine-looking old lady; spoke

very affectionately of you. It would be delightful for you to

see her. Aunt Fanny is a beautiful old lady also. Lucy took to

her particularly. Aunt Noyes looks very old; is quiet and ear-

nest, reminding one of Uncle Russell. The cousins generally are

agreeable people and it was pleasant to meet them. I can tell

you more of them when we meet.

  I got a long letter written by my father in 1820 to Uncle

Russell which you will like to read; also one of your letters

written about the same time. You know I am prone to keep old

letters and relics and value them more than most people do. I

am to have the old Hayes clock. . . .

                       Affectionately,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                           CINCINNATI, September 20, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--Walstein and his wife had, I hope, a visit

that paid. We enjoyed it very much, but they totally missed the

Fair. The good part of the Fair has been this week. I never

was more agreeably disappointed than when I visited it yester-

day.  The greatest crowd I ever saw--the finest fruit, flowers,

machinery, implements of agriculture, etc., etc. The amount and

variety of stock was not great, but very superior in quality. In-

stead of being inferior to State Fairs, it was far beyond them.

  I have got Grandfather Hayes' old clock. It arrived safely a

few days ago. I shall have it fixed up to keep time. I am at

leisure again, and hope you are well.

                           Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.





 September 29, 1860.--About 4:30 P. M. the Prince of Wales

[later King Edward VII] passed here. He rode in a carriage









<B>564          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



drawn by four gray horses with the mayor sitting by his side,

the Duke of Newcastle and ---- Germaine sitting in the

front seat. All saw him from our front window, second story,

Birch, Webb, Babe, and all. He was dressed in the common

style. Black silk hat, blue frock coat, and light pants. A mild

agreeable face, long nose, fair complexion, light, slender, and

medium height.





                           CINCINNATI, September 30, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . . I have made a few little speeches

in the country townships, and shall make a few more. I cannot

get up much interest in the contest. A wholesome contempt for

Douglas, on account of his recent demagoguery, is the chief feel-

ing I have. I am not so confident that Lincoln will get votes

enough as many of our friends. I think his chances are fair,

but what may be the effect of fusions in such anti-Republican

States as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, is more than I can tell

or confidently guess until after the state elections. In this county,

the fight is doubtful, but probably against us.

  We saw the Prince yesterday as he passed our house. A mod-

est, decently behaved youngster. His visit has been without un-

pleasant incidents.--Love to all.

                            Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                              CINCINNATI, October 7, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I have not heard from you for so long that

I conclude that you are unusually busy this fine weather, and that

your health is good. I hope it will not be injured by hard work,

nor, when the weather changes, by exposure.

  I write chiefly to get your suggestions as to your room in the

third story. Our neighbor east, Mr. Johnson, has built a brick

kitchen which somewhat darkens my library room; besides, it

is a sort of passageway for the whole family. I am thinking of

moving my books, etc., into your room. I shall never be disturbed

by you, and I think I would not want to occupy it in a way to









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          565</B>



incommode you.     On  the contrary, it occurs to me that  it

might be agreeable to you. If I am mistaken, do not hesitate to

say so, for Dr. Joe wants me to take his room, but I prefer, on

some accounts, not to do so.

  We have had a pleasant, lively little election canvass. I have

enjoyed it well; no hard work and some sport. Our meetings

are prodigious; but for the American [Know-Nothing] element,

we would carry this county easily; as it is, we shall do well.

                            Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                             CINCINNATI, October 15, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--Glad to know that you will not object to my

traps in your chamber. I shall move up my books, etc., this week.

Mother has returned home from Delaware after a good visit with

Mrs. Wasson. Stem told me of your visit to Green Spring. We

have had jolly good times rejoicing over the elections. Lucy

and the boys had the best of it. On Saturday I dined out at

Joseph Longworth's. He has a few paintings--only ten or a

dozen,--but they are superb, some of them equal, no doubt,

to any in the world. He told me to bring you to see them without

fail. He likes to show and talk about them.

                            Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                            COLUMBUS, October 22, 1860.

                                          Monday morning.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I came up Friday evening and shall return

home today. This is my first visit here since early in July, be-

fore my trip East. I find Mother very well and in a more cheer-

ful mood than usual. She had a happy visit at Delaware and

feels glad to be again home, with some new recollections to oc-

cupy her mind. Laura is natural and agreeable--has a few

beaux--is "coming out" this winter, but will not, I think, be

much injured by any attention she may receive. Elinor Mead

[later to become the wife of W. D. Howells] is coming here in a









<B>566          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



month or six weeks to stay the winter. Fanny is in improved

health; the other children as usual.

  Thanks for the six barrels [of] apples; they arrived safely. I

have completed my removal into your room and like the change.

No change in friends here worth noticing.

                            Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  November 6, 1860.--Election day. Had a birthday feast in

honor of Birch's 7th birthday (Sunday 4th) today. Aunty and

Uncle Warren both present. Boys delighted with their presents.

  The Southern States are uneasy at the prospect of Lincoln's

election today. The ultra South threatens disunion, and it now

looks as if South Carolina and possibly two or three others would

go out of the Union. Will they? And if so, what is to be the

result? Will other slave States gradually be drawn after them,

or will the influence of the conservative States draw back into

the Union or hold in the Union the ultra States? I think the

latter. But at all events, I feel as if the time had come to test

this question. If the threats are meant, then it is time the Union

was dissolved or the traitors crushed out. I hope Lincoln goes

in. All now depends on New York. The October elections

settled Pennsylvania and the other doubtful States.





                                 CITY SOLICITOR'S OFFICE,

                                         CINCINNATI, 1860.

  Mr. E. T. Carson will be an applicant for the United States

marshalship in this district. I have been requested to write

you a few words in his behalf. Of his qualifications for the

office I need not speak. You doubtless know enough about him

to be satisfied on that head. He has done much good service

in the cause, and has suffered in consequence. Having two years

ago secured the nomination for sheriff of this county, after a

bitter and expensive contest, he gave up his place on the ticket

to promote what was thought then to be the interest of the









             <B>CITY SOLICITOR--CINCINNATI, 1858-1860          567</B>



Republican party. I might refer to other facts, but you are so

familiar with our local politics that I need not do so.

  There will of course be other applicants for the place, but

none I venture to say whose fitness for it and whose position and

services constitute a better claim than that of Mr. Carson.

  I have heard no facts from which to form even a conjecture

as to what course you will deem it proper to pursue respecting

appointments in Ohio under the new Administration, but in any

event mention of Mr. Carson's wishes this early day can do no

harm.

  Your speech in Covington was the right thing in the right

place. Your views of the way by which the Republican party

expects to preserve freedom in the Territories strike me as pre-

cisely right. Some of our leading Douglas men complain that

you are stealing their thunder. It ought to be taken from them.

They have shown their inability to use it.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R.B. HAYES.<B>*</B>



                              CINCINNATI, December 9, 1860.

  DEAR UNCLE:--It is three weeks since you wrote.  I do not

feel uneasy about your health; if you were sick, you would write;

but I am wanting in faith that bankers are ever safe, and I fear

these squally times may bring you worriment and losses. How

is it?. . . . .

  With me, matters are looking well. My health is not merely

good, but really robust. The bell rings for tea.--Good-bye.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  December 14, 1860.--Mother is here quite ill with a severe

cold; is able to sit up, but very weak. She fears she has the

consumption. I hope not. She talks of her relatives, of her early

days, and is fond of recurring to them. She is sixty-eight years



<FONT SIZE="-1">  *This letter, undated and unaddressed, was doubtless written in the

old; will be sixty-nine next ----. When seventeen or eighteen,

she spent a winter in New York City with her Uncle Daniel

Austin. Her complexion was very fair as now, but then with

rosy red cheeks. Once walking on Broadway with a young lady,

healthy and plump but pale, the contrast attracted the attention of

two ladies they met. One pointing at mother said, "Oh, see the

paint." Mother went home so mortified, she could not help

crying; but her aunt said: "All of our young ladies would give

anything for your natural roses." Mother was born in Vermont,

She was sent to New York to get her away from my

father who had been her beau. Soon after she came to New

York her Uncle Daniel brought in a letter from Brattleboro, Ver-

mont.  "Have you any friends in Brattleboro?"--"Yes, a school

friend, Miss ----."--"But this is directed by a gentleman."

--"Yes, I have a gentleman friend also."--"Does your mother

know that he is your correspondent?"--"No."--"Do you ex-

pect to marry him?"--"I shall, if I ever marry anybody." The

uncle inquired about him particularly and asked, "Do you intend

to reply to this letter?"--"Yes, unless you say I shall not."

The sensible uncle said, "I do not say so," and always after-

wards handed mother the letters written by my father so as not

to attract the attention of the rest of the family. On the return

of mother to her mother in Vermont, her mother made no ob-

jection to the marriage, and in due time it took place.

  December 24, 1860.--Christmas eve. Lucy gone to Chillicothe.

Mem.:--All ought to be at home to make home happy on these

festal days. Boys well; hardly know what they want "Old Chris"

to bring them. Eleven years ago tonight I came to Cincinnati.

A prosperous happy term of life I have had. I cannot anticipate

a happier in the years to come. Only one sad spot in all the

time--the death of my dear, dear sister.  Mother is with us.
