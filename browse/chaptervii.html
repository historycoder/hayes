  HAYES left the Law School at the end of his third semester,

early in February, 1845, and returned to Columbus.  A

month later, March 1O, at Marietta, he was admitted to the bar.

He established himself at Lower Sandusky (Fremont), where his

uncle and protector, Sardis Birchard, and a favorite cousin, John

R. Pease, were engaged in business.]

  Lower Sandusky, April 12, 1845.--I am now settled in my

new home. I do not expect much employment in my profession,

but while I am waiting I shall try to fit myself for practice. As

I shall not be likely to write in my journal a great deal, I shall put

down the ideas which occur to me in my miscellaneous reading,

and make extracts; note peculiar phrases, etc.

  April 15.--[According to] D'Aubigne's "History of the Ref-

ormation," Christianity has two features which especially dis-

tinguish it from all human systems: (1) That the only mediator

between God and man is Jesus Christ. (2) That salvation is a

gift of God--a matter of grace.  .  .  . D'Aubigne constantly

affirms that, in his opinion, the Reformation was the immediate

work of the Divine hand.

  Now, it seems to me that Providence interferes no more in the

greatest affairs of men than in the smallest, and that neither indi-

viduals nor nations are any more the objects of a special interposi-

tion of the Divine Ruler than the inanimate things of the world.

The Creator gave to every creature of his hand its laws at the

time of its creation and whatever can happen in accordance with

those laws He doubtless foresaw, and it cannot be supposed that

his laws are so imperfect that special interpositions are necessary

to render them capable of fulfilling their design, nor that it is

possible for them to be violated. The Reformation like other

revolutions was agreeable to principles which have existed since

the world began.

  May 7, 1845.--I am now fairly settled. Let me see how I will

arrange my plans for study and business. Read Greenleaf's "Evi-

dence" and Story's "Agency" so as to finish them both in six

weeks. Read a chapter in the Testament (German); one case a

week in Smith's "Leading Cases" touching some topic of

"Agency" or "Evidence." Read a little Bacon and Burke; study

Livy an hour in the morning, and logic at night. Poetry and light

literature Sunday. Attend church regularly, and do all my busi-

ness promptly.

  Now, of so much, some must many days be neglected. The

order of preference shall be Latin, Evidence, Agency, German,

Bacon, Logic, Burke, Smith's cases. Business first always.





                       LOWER SANDUSKY, April 20, [1845].

  DEAR SISTER:--I would have written before this if I had not

supposed that one or both of our cousins would have arrived

here yesterday. Austin expected that his sister would come last

week or he would have gone down after her. He is looking

for her every day. Uncle says that if Charlotte [Birchard, a

cousin from Vermont] does not choose to come with Dr. Rawson,

he will take his buggy and bring her up in a week or ten days

from now, making some stop at Delaware en route. The doctor

will be in Columbus about the middle or latter part of this week.

He went down the Muskingum and so around to Cincinnati.

  Enough for the family.--Now a little to Sister Fanny:

  I shall enjoy my  stay here finely.   I can study as much

as I wish to and feel independent.      The lawyers all treat

me kindly and the only ones I could ever think of dreading

are decidedly friendly. I can borrow all the books I want for

the present. (I would mend this pen, but my knife is too dull.

I left one at Columbus. If it is not found I wish William would

send me the best penknife in his shop and charge it to me.) When

I wish to see anybody I can go to Sandusky, Norwalk, or

Maumee. I have already made agreeable acquaintances in all









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1845          165</B>



the towns in this circuit. I shall spend this week in Lucas County.

Judge Lane passed through today. At Sandusky I met a number

of my old friends, among others Baker, who was at Cambridge

and is now settled at Toledo. So that you preceive I shall not

suffer for want of company, although there is no one here of

my own age who is fit for a "trusted cronie." Between you and

I, a little squad of girls have spent a great deal of time and pains

in trying to get acquainted with me--calling to see a young

married woman at our house and deputizing her to call me in,

but I have been so ungallant that they now despair of accomplish-

ing their object. Their messenger wanted me to explain why I

was so averse. I first told her that I was no lady's man, but as

that wouldn't do I then told her I was engaged to a girl in Colum-

bus, which has relieved me from all trouble. The point now is

to find out who my engagee is. This is to be discovered by learn-

ing who I write to, but as I don't write to any miss, I think they

will not be the wiser from a knowledge of my correspondents.

  I assisted in pettifogging a case last week and have hopes of

becoming quite a pettifogger in time. My prospects as to business

are better than are given to most young lawyers. The fact that

Lower Sandusky is what it is makes it just the place for me. I

have but little competition, taking industry and honesty as

among my qualifications, for with one exception (R. P. Buck-

land) those of our lawyers who are responsible or honest are not

industrious, and vice versa.

   You rather insinuate that our cousin Cynthia is not a Venus.

Now, I would insinuate that her brother, Austin, is not an Apollo.

You never saw "a homelier girl." I never saw so homely a man

by great odds. Oh, he passes caricaturing, and then he dresses

like sin. I hope Charlotte [Birchard] will please you. Uncle

wished her to come here before she went to Columbus.

   Pease and myself have fine times. We sleep in the same room,

have got up a good "washing machine" in which we take a shower

bath every morning as soon as we get out of bed. Quite as good

as a pill-box for health. You have no idea how he loved his

wife. I did not imagine he was capable of so much affection

for anyone. She must have had some sterling qualities. He

thinks she was the essence of perfection . . . . .   Give my love









<B>166          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to cousins in such quantities and in such phrase as will be most

likely to please; how glad I shall be to see them (!) and all that.

                 Your affectionate Brother,

                                                   R. B.

  P. S.--I forgot to say, I've been at Stemtown [Green Spring]

with Uncle and like the family well. I did not see her, tho

Uncle did. He has been out there again today. There's nothing

in it I suppose. It is about sixteen miles from here in a pleasant

part of Seneca County.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                            LOWER SANDUSKY, June 1, 1845.

  DEAR SISTER:--Charlotte, Uncle, and myself have each been

expecting that the other would write to you, and this is the reason

which I suppose each would give for not having done it. Char-

lotte seems to enjoy herself very well, and Uncle has formed a

high opinion of her good sense and discretion. They are both

boarding at Dr. Rawson's, which I think is a very pleasant place

for them. One or the other of us is in the habit of riding out

with Charlotte almost every day. She thinks the rides in the

country are very fine; but the appearance of the village disap-

pointed her sadly. She had formed her idea of the place from

Uncle's conversation; who, you know, is a lover, and speaks

like a lover of everything which he cares about from the chair

he sits on to the town he lives in. Expecting, therefore, some-

thing better than ordinary in Lower Sandusky, it was quite nat-

ural she should be surprised to find a town in which the houses,

fences, etc., (with one exception) were built not merely without

any good taste, but with apparent disregard of all taste and com-

fort.

   Charlotte has made a number of acquaintances among the

female women, some of whom she likes well, and others she

thinks are shockingly simple. I was introduced to one of the

latter sort a few evenings since. Excuse me if I describe the

bow or curtsey (I'll call it "manners") she made at me. It was

quite an amusing feat. I doubt whether Mr. Yeo has a pupil

who could equal it.  Certainly it would endanger the necks









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1845          167</B>



of most girls to attempt it. It begins with a sudden squat of

the main trunk of the body and a simultaneous dropping of the

head and arms. Then succeeds a violent trembling as if each

particular member and limb was making a most excruciating

effort to separate itself from every other. The performer gasps,

her lips curl up from her teeth, a frightened smile scampers over

her face, commencing at her chin, rising over her forehead, and

losing itself in her hair. She resumes her upright position with

a jerk, looks sober and satisfied; the feat is accomplished, and

the astonished beholder has liberty to go on breathing, as if noth-

ing had happened. I hope you will not think I am growing crit-

ical in regard to manners, but when people take such pains to act

the monkey, it is difficult to avoid noticing it.

  I have been at Sandusky City, Milan, and all about since I

wrote you last, hunting evidence to convict a very clever, genteel

knave (formerly one of Herman A. Moore's stewards, named

Clarke) for stealing Pease's wallet containing one hundred and

twenty-two dollars in money, three or four hundred dollars in

notes, and a watch, and also my watch.  He boarded with his

wife at Tompson's and came into our room in the night and

did the stealing. We are all satisfied he is the man, but we are

some afraid he cannot be convicted. He is now in jail awaiting

his  trial.  He  has  been  married  about  three months  to

a very fine girl who thinks our conduct in accusing him

is "diabolical."  Pease and myself sat at the table with her

two or three days after we knew her husband was guilty

before she had heard of the robbery, and she would jest about

his prolonged absence.  That was the most painful part of the

transaction.  Clarke was in the secrets of the Loco-focos. Wat-

son and myself examined his papers. We made some rich dis-

coveries. By the way, though Watson is a first-rate man in some

respects, he don't pay debts. I have dunned him for William and

think there is about an even chance of catching him with his

pockets full.

  It is still healthy here, but drought and frost frighten the timid

who are beginning to prophesy famine. I am still contented as

a clam. I have studied as much law since I have been here as

during any equal portion of time before I was admitted. Tell









<B>168          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Mother I have read five chapters in her present every day (when

I was at home) since I received it.

                      Your affectionate brother,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                         LOWER SANDUSKY, June 9, [1845].

  DEAR MOTHER:--Our sheriff, Mr. Burger, is to leave today

for Columbus to carry my friend Clarke to the State Prison,

of whom I told you in my  last letter.  .  .  .  I am sorry to

hear of Harriet Platt's misfortune. I hope she will not be lamed

by it.

  I do not know whether I can go to Gambier in August or not.

I was appointed to deliver the Master's Oration, but despatched

by the mail this morning a letter declining to accept the ap-

pointment. Do not mention this, as some of my classmates may

hereafter be appointed and would not be pleased to hear of a

previous appointment.    Charlotte  still seems  in fine spirits.

Uncle's health is good, ditto Pease's, ditto Hayes's.

                         Your affectionate son,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                        LOWER SANDUSKY, August 20, 1845.

  DEAR MOTHER:--Contrary to a long established custom,  I

have made up my mind to write you a letter on a week-day. I

do not feel like working, or doing anything that requires much

thought, but I think I can scratch off a few lines to you as easily

as I can do anything else and with as much pleasure to myself.

The Supreme Court has just closed its session without finishing

more than a third of the business on the docket. One of my

old friends, named [Stanley] Matthews, came from Cincinnati to

[be] examined for admission to the bar.  I was one of the com-

mittee to examine him. He graduated about two years before

I did and was beyond dispute a better lawyer than any of the

examining committee. The good lawyers were all too busy in

court to be sent off on such sham service.

  Uncle has just come in and wants to have you write imme-









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1845          169</B>



diately and tell him when William is going to New York. He

wishes to get to Columbus before he leaves home. Charlotte

can stay but a few days with you as the term begins so soon.

We have a preference for the Episcopal School at Granville as

the other young lady from here intends going there.

  I had a letter from Fanny at Berkshire [Ohio] the same day

Uncle received yours. I am glad she took that little trip. It

must be [good] for the health of the children as well as of

Fanny herself.....

  You see, Mother, I hardly have enough material to fill a letter

with. [If] I was in bad health, or lonesome, or homesick, or

greatly in want of something, I could probably write something

of a letter. As it is, I am sadly in want of information and the

wherewithal to fill a letter. It is, I believe, (as our parson ex-

presses it) "a time of general health," and since harvest business

is "looking up," Pease has gone to New York. I expect him

to return next week unless he should visit New Haven and Ver-

mont.

  I see you speak of Elizabeth Hulbord's going to Granville to

school. I believe she is one of the three or four girls that you

limited me to in choosing a partner from among the Columbus

girls. So I feel a great deal of interest in her as in duty bound

to do, but as I have never seen her nor even heard much of

her, I don't think I should be disconsolate if some other young-

ster should carry [her] off. Nevertheless I am open to convic-

tion on that subject. As I often tell Uncle, I'm determined to

marry young if I can find a lass that suits me, that I can please.

-Love to all.

                          You affectionate son,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                        LOWER SANDUSKY, August 27, 1845.

  DEAR MOTHER:--Uncle and Charlotte are going up to Mr.

Valette's this evening and will start from there early in the

morning for Columbus. I will not break in upon the venerable

custom of sending letters by friends instead of the mail whenever

there is an opportunity, although the reason for it has ceased









<B>170          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



under the new postage law. Besides, I hope by frequency of

communication to lessen the distance between us which accord-

ing to your last letter you still seem to deplore.  I will try to

clear myself of blame for not going to Gambier, because friend

Lane did not hear from me in time to go.     I would not at that

time have been away from here more than ten days.  In order

to make the trip in that time, my plan was to leave here for

Gambier by the way of Mansfield so as to be at Gambier on

commencement day and get to Columbus in four or five days.

I should then have staid with you a couple of days or so and

come home by Delaware. So that I never dreamed of your

having any notion of going to Gambier with me. You had never

intimated any desire to do so, and by my arrangement the thing

was impossible. As for those girls, I certainly cared nothing

about going because they were going.     And in looking at the

letters you wrote me I do not find that you urged me to go at all.

You spoke of wishing to see me at Columbus--but if the girls

employed you to induce me to go to Gambier, indeed, Mother,

they might bring an action against you for neglecting your trust.

So that all you say about having "to acknowledge that you could

not influence your only son" is founded upon a mistake, as that

influence was never exerted.

  I was a little surprised at the mournful strain of a part of your

letter and really felt a good deal grieved at it, but I was satisfied

that it wasn't me alone that was in fault, as little Laura came in

for a share of the scolding, and I know you were not really

offended with her, and am quite sure that you are not really

angry with me a great deal. At least I hope you will forgive

me as I am as innocent of intentional disregard of your wishes as

Laura was in scratching your letter.  Besides, from what you

say, I imagine you were not the only one whose feelings were

clouded the day you wrote.     I hope Dr. Hoge will give you

good sermons, for in every letter in which you speak of  the

doctor's giving one of his best I notice that there is a wonder-

ful flow of cheerfulness and good feeling.

  As to our seeing each other often in future, I shall visit

Columbus twice a year, making a good stay each time. Besides

that, some of these days, I hope to have a place for you here









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1845          171</B>



where you will feel quite as much at home as with Fanny. In

fact, I think, if you had accepted Uncle's invitation to come this

summer you would have found no great difference between Mr.

Valette's and your own home. Though Lower Sandusky is not

the most delightful village, I think you would find enough agree-

able ladies here to enable you to pass time very pleasantly.

  Pease has not yet returned from New York. I think he must

be making a visit to our friends in Vermont. Have you heard

from them lately? I could not come with Uncle conveniently if

I wished to do so, to say nothing of your sickly climate in Colum-

bus.  I fear I should run great risk in going from our healthy

lake air to the heated atmosphere at the south.

                    Your affectionate son,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                          LOWER SANDUSKY, August 27, 1845.

  DEAR  FANNY:--I  am greatly obliged for your letter from

Berkshire.  I had written to you some days before I received it

but directed my letter to Columbus, not knowing that you were

off rusticating, or "ruralizing," as you have it.  I am  perfectly

willing to write you very early and often but the want of gossip

and other matters fit to communicate prevents me from doing

it, though I think I am  not a very great delinquent.     I could

write a sheet over 'most any time in expressing my affection,

good feeling, good wishes, etc., for in that I think I abound;

but after writing that once, one hates to be repeating it on every

occasion; it is only permitted in love letters which are always

said to be interesting to nobody except the parties.

  I do not know whether Charlotte has written you often or not,

but as you will have her in your jurisdiction as soon as you get

this, I can only advise you to hold her to strict account for her

various shortcomings. Badly as some folks think this delightful

village deserves to be spoken of, I suppose you will think Cousin

Charlotte has not suffered in manners, disposition, etc., etc., by

her sojourn here; indeed we think she has gained greatly by

naturalization.  There was certainly, as in most of people, some

room for improvement, and she appears to have enough native









<B>172          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



good sense to encourage friends in their endeavors to supply de-

fects and remove faults. . . . 

  You need have no fears that the little intervals between our

interviews face to face will be enough to destroy the feeling

which as sister and brother we have mutually felt for each other.

The time when that might have happened has passed away.

Separation soon cools the affection which children have for each

other, but after that period it requires some more active agency

to affect it.  Anger and rivalry may lead to indifference, or

perhaps a stronger feeling, between those who have loved each

other from childhood, but nothing of that sort can come between

a sister and brother.  You are too ambitious in your anticipa-

tions concerning my fortunes.     That I shall not "make an ill

figure" in the world, I feel confident, because I think I have a

pretty perfect knowledge of my own ability (considering how

partial I must be); and Macaulay says:      "It is an undisputed

fact that no man ever made an ill figure who understood his

own talents, nor a good one who mistook them." The idea that

I have an unusual degree of talent (which I am afraid you

fondly imagine) is little short of ridiculous; but that with health

and ordinary good fortune, I shall be able to make a respectable

lawyer and acquire friends, influence, and property enough to

pass life with a fair share of rational enjoyments, I have too

much self-esteem to allow myself to doubt.       Beyond this my

wishes do not go. Those who really have excellent parts ought

to have an ambition corresponding to their superiority.      Such

men I can admire, can with good heart assist, and can never

feel like envying or pulling down. You have my ideas of the

future. One cannot easily talk on such matters without exhibit-

ing some vanity, but if none but friends discern the weakness,

little mischief is to be feared if the person interested is aware

of it, and regulates his conduct accordingly. . . . Good luck

to you.

                         Your brother,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1845          173</B>



                         LOWER SANDUSKY, October 12, 1845.

  DEAR MOTHER:--Court week has just closed and I have

nothing of importance to look forward  to before the time of

visiting home.   It is impossible for me to leave here, for so

long a time as I should wish to spend in visiting you, before the

middle of November, as I have several little matters to be at-

tended to at different times between now and then.  Will Lane

paid me a visit this last week.   He has improved considerably

since I last saw him and is really a glorious fellow.    He will

visit Columbus about the same time I wish to.       I had not a

world to do in court, but I got through with what business I had

to my satisfaction.   I had often been told when I was study-

ing law that the study was very pleasant, but the practice dry

and tedious. I have thus far found the contrary nearer true.

The study the first year was certainly the most vexatious and

tedious of anything  I ever attempted; the practice (I think

I may speak for the first year now) is, upon the whole, quite

interesting. Much more so than I ever anticipated.

  Uncle has been to the land sales at Upper Sandusky and pur-

chased a little more land. He thinks something can be made by

the speculation. His health is very good now. We hear from

Charlotte about as often as could be expected.   She thought she

had a slight touch of the chills and fever soon after she went

to Granville, but is bravely over it and seems to herself well.

She has found a stray cousin or two in the Baptist college named

Austin.

  I have not your letter at hand and do not recollect whether

you said anything requiring particular notice or not; if you did,

write soon and mention it again. It is raining for quantity today

and the roads will soon be so bad that we can't get out of town

in more than one direction, except by water.      However, that

is an advantage which most towns in the interior cannot boast

of. By the way, I believe you said in your last that you never

were really convinced that I was pleased with my present resi-

dence until you received my last letter.  Judge Tilden and Judge

Lane both told me this court that I deserved success for the









<B>174          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



wisdom I [had] shown, in spite of appearances, in selecting my

location. Love to the family. Write soon.

                    Your affectionate son,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                      LOWER SANDUSKY, December 11, 1845.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I have just thought I ought to write you once

more before I leave for Columbus. We now have beautiful

weather and excellent sleighing. I shall be busy while the snow is

on the ground visiting the justices of the peace, etc., etc.  If

nothing occurs to prevent I shall leave for Columbus a week

from tomorrow, and if I do not stop at Tiffin or Delaware shall

be at home one week after this letter reaches you.

  Uncle wishes you to take notice that he will expect you to go

East with him next summer, and leave you there as long as you

wish to stay; and when you have enough of visiting, either he or

I will come after you. I think you will enjoy such a trip. Travel-

ling is so cheap and easy that there seems almost no objection to

it and you now have timely notice of Uncle's invitation so as to

enable you to make your preparations leisurely.

  I had written thus far when called to other matters. Since

then the southern mail has arrived and, greatly to my gratification

and somewhat to my surprise, it brings me a letter from you and

Brother William. I will attend to your request as to matters at

Delaware and William's Walter Scott (whew!) at Marion. As

to his friend here, you may tell him the less he expects the less

he will be disappointed. As [Lorenzo] Dow [a famous evangel-

ist] said: "Blessed is he who expects nothing for he shall not

be disappointed." Now, Watson is one of the cleverest men alive

but his "financing" is a standing joke with Rawson, Pease, and

Uncle. If his sins of omission were not clearly unintentional, he

couldn't live comfortably a week.

  Uncle's health is good. He and Pease talk of going to Colum-

bus about the 8th of January ("Loco Convention").

  I am in the greatest hurry imaginable tonight or I'd write more.

I received a letter from Tiffin which I was looking for very









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          175</B>



anxiously and which gives me a few hours of busy but pleasant

exertion.--Love to all. Good night.

                      Your affectionate son,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                      LOWER SANDUSKY, February 28, 1846.

  MY DEAR SISTER:--For a wonder I've commenced you a letter

on a secular day. I was out sleigh-riding until almost daylight

this morning. My office is swept out, books and papers all in their

places, and I'm just sleepy enough to write letters and too sleepy

to do anything else. For two weeks we have had most excellent

sleighing; during the past week the best I ever saw. It was

beginning to wear off some, but this morning it commenced snow-

ing and there is now a deep snow on the ground and the weather

growing cold, so I think we may feel sure of another lively week.

I was at Sandusky City a week ago. The town was very dull

compared with ours. We see nearly a hundred sleighs in our

streets to their one. Will Lane will leave for his trip across the

water in about a month. By the by, Mrs. Follet was here yester-

day. I called on her of course. She said many things very flat-

tering about you, Mr. Platt, Mother, and the little ones, and hinted

very broadly that I was probably quite equal to the rest of the kin!

[She] talked some about her daughters and gave me a pressing

invitation to visit her and them. . . . .

  I've been on two sleigh-rides this week out half-way to Perrys-

burg. I took Charlotte's friend, Sarah Coles, to the last one.

They are the first of the kind I ever enjoyed. They "paid"

reasonably well, but I think I may say without disparagement to

our girls, that if Miss W., or even one or two younger girls of

your acquaintance, had been of the party, I should have been

quite as much delighted with the whole affair as I was "under

existing circumstances." I wish Charlotte was here. I really

believe we could make sport for her. . . . .

  I haven't your letter at hand, but you may tell Miss W. that if

I do happen to meet her this summer in any car, stage, or steam-

boat, and there is no one else about to help me kill time, no









<B>176          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



books or papers to read, and the weather is gloomy so that nothing

pleasant can be seen, and it is impossible to do anything else,

perhaps, to while away the time, I'll speak to her. But I see no

reason why she should threaten to snarl or bite, or be anything

else than amiable since she knows where I spent that evening and

can easily infer the strength of the attraction that prevented me

from meeting her! Now, if she were ignorant of the fact she

alluded to, and really supposed that carelessness or indifference

led me to neglect my engagement, her anger would be excusable;

but "under existing circumstances," it's altogether preposterous.

  I rather suspect that all your efforts to fix the orbits, etc., of

those other "lesser" lights will be in vain. No difference: I shall

probably pick up a figure nearer home though you may keep an

eye to 'em and particularly reconsider your notions about that

crazy little sister of Mrs. Sparrow's.  She may come out yet.

She is a bright scholar for her age though she don't sing. There,

if I haven't repaid you for your flattery by a dish of sparking

so as to stop your mouth in the future, try me again. . . . .

  Good night.--Love to all.

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                             LOWER SANDUSKY, July 7, 1846.

  DEAR SISTER:--Mother left here yesterday in company with

all the cousins and Uncle for Sandusky. I've not yet heard

whether or not they took a boat last evening; if they did their

little trip has been pleasant. I expect Uncle back this evening.

He is to bring Mr. Bebb back with him, who speaks here to-

morrow.

  We had quite a Columbus fair here the Fourth, in the evening.

I could almost fancy that I was in Mechanics' Hall again. The

chief difference was that there were fewer strange faces. Mother

seemed to enjoy it, especially as it was for the benefit of the

Presbyterian Church. Charlotte officiated as postmistress.

  I've looked for your letter but don't find it.  I think you said

something which looked like disapprobation of my want of zeal

in not hastening to Sandusky to see  Miss W.           But  this is

not the first sin of the kind I've committed.  I had  from a









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          177</B>



good authority, a short time ago, an account of one of the most

perfected of the last work of creation, and was urged to go a few

miles to visit her, and though I believed the story most religiously,

I refused to go. However, I shall pay this last divinity a visit

in a few weeks and if she comes within drum-beat of the descrip-

tion I have heard of her, I shall be sure to fall a conquest to her

charms.

  Upon turning the sheet over and coming to the top of this

page, I stopped to think what I commenced this letter to you for,

and I now remember that it was Mother's pressing solicitation

that I should write by the first mail that she was getting along

well on her journey, and that she missed Laura very much and

hoped Laura wouldn't feel so sorry to be separated from Grandma

as Grandmother is to be away from Laura. Mother's account of

Laura's feelings was really quite touching.

  Charlotte seemed to be as glad to start for home as could be

expected, considering that she is leaving sundry beaux behind

her, and none of them more than half "fetched." Speaking of

"fetching" brings to mind Hatty as naturally as the sight of ice

makes one thing of cream. I wish I was with you about these

times.  Perhaps I shall go to Gambier this next Commencement,

and if I do I'll certainly spread myself as far as Columbus.

There is no certainty that I'll do the like but may be I will.

  It is a mighty warm afternoon and I don't feel very vigorous

so "excuse haste and a bad pen."

  Love to all.--Your affectionate brother,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                          LOWER SANDUSKY, August 7, 1846.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I  promised Uncle to write to you today,

or I am quite sure you would never have been troubled with this

scrawl.  We  are all well; eating, drinking, and sleeping as

usual. This is no news and yet it comprises all that need be

told to give you a complete idea of our situation. I've no doubt

but there is as much small gossip about town among the retailers

of that commodity as usual, but bachelors, you know, are not in

the way of knowing such matters, and my taste runs so little

   12









<B>178          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



in that direction that I wouldn't step out of my way for all the

precious "titbits" that a lean old maid could pick up in a week's

gadding. . . . .

  I wish I were with you about two weeks to visit all our friends

in Vermont with you. You must tell my little cousin at Grand-

mother's not to forget her bargain with me about copying in a

book for me all of Grandmother's writings that she can lay her

hands on. I think from appearances I shall be fortunate enough

in business to pay her all I promised. I'd give more for that

little volume than anything else I can think of in the State of

Vermont. Not but that Vermont has a great many fine things

in it, and although it may be true, as we often tell Pease in teas-

ing him about his brag State, that Vermont has more acres to

the square mile than any other State in the Union, yet as Grand-

mother is the only genius in the blood, we must save her writings

or we shall never have any worth saving.

            . . . .  Remember  [me]to such of our friends as care

anything about me. I shall see them if I live within a year or

two, I presume,             Your affectionate son,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--Uncle wishes me to say further that either he or I will

come on after you, whenever you send on after one of us.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

     Fayetteville, Vermont.

                          LOWER SANDUSKY, August 20, 1846.

  DEAR COZ:--Don't be distressed at the sight of this formid-

able sheet of foolscap, for I've no thoughts of inflicting on you

a letter of more than ordinary dimensions; but "the facts are,"

as John R. [Pease] would say, that there isn't a sheet of letter-

paper in the office except some that's so slippery that it would

bother a Matamoras fly to walk on it; and as this writing letters

to a lady not nearer of kin than cousin is rather a slippery busi-

ness at the best, I thought it wouldn't do to make the attempt

upon such dangerous paper. But I want you to understand that

I've got some letter paper, and it looks as smooth and blue and

saucy as heart could wish; so don't make any reflections to the









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          179</B>



disparagement of us abrogoins on account of our letters, for we

are up to the genteel, and would willingly give you a specimen

if it were not so mighty inconvenient.

  There, Janette, if you are half as glad to get through

that rambling sentence as I am, you'll feel under some obliga-

tions to me, I'm sure; for commencing a letter, like beginning an

acquaintance, is usually more embarrassing than interesting; but

when the "ice is broken" and the tongue loosed (or pen), it goes

off "as merrily as a marriage bell."

  I suppose by this time a query has grown up in your mind as

to the why and wherefore of my writing to you. Well, I'll tell

you.  John R., that is to say, Mr. Pease,--Mr. that sounds

oddly enough at the beginning of our cousin's name (I ask par-

don, I believe he is your brother [half-brother, in fact]; but it

don't seem natural that he should be any nearer relation to any-

body else than he is to me, seeing that I've slept where I could

hear him snore any time in the last eighteen months). Here

I am snarled up in another long sentence, but to begin again:

John R. received a letter from you two or three days ago which

he thinks ought to be answered, and as he has some three or

four tons of stoves, and an everlasting sight of tin, sheet-iron,

and Yankee notions to haul up from the landing, a new shop and

store to fit up, arrange, etc., etc., not to mention a batch of mis-

cellaneous duties which have to be attended to at stated intervals,

--such, for instance, as shaking like an aspen leaf in a hurricane

with ague a couple of hours daily, together with the pleasant

accompaniments of a burning fever and parched tongue, things

which you know in this climate are regarded as among the neces-

saries of life (not rarities as with you) and must be attended to

"will ye nill ye,"--he thought I'd better take your letter and

reply to it in such wise as seemed to me meet and proper.

  On reflection I've determined to write you a long letter--one

so long that you'll never want to see another from under my pen.

So, to begin, I'll go clear out to the margin (thus).

  John is in fine health and excellent spirits; never enjoyed a

trip home so much in his life, and is full of regrets that he didn't

stay longer.  He had told me all about those glorious girls be-

fore we had been together two hours--not exactly in love









<B>180          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



with either, but highly pleased with both; though I think he

rather preferred the one whom I suppose you allude to as "A."

Uncle and myself (by the way, you must know that Uncle, John

and myself form a family trio in which there are to be no secrets

--what interests one is known to all; in fact each one is more

solicitous about the weal of the others than of his own) were in

favor of posting him back to Vermont to finish his business;

and we agreed to throw dust in the eyes of all inquisitive neigh-

bors as to the object of his journey, even if we had to suffer the

wear and tear of conscience requisite for telling three score

white lies a day for a month.     But you know that the strong

point in John R.'s character is inertia, so that if he once stops, a

forty-horse-power can't start him again; and if he starts in a

certain direction you can't turn him "no more nor" a locomotive.

For example, he set out in life, like the blacksmith in "Waverley,"

with a mortal dislike of "all Whigs and Presbyterians," and

though his nearest connections are Presbyterians and his most

intimate friends Whigs, yet he still clings to his ancient prejudice

like a miser to his gold.    Well, he had come home, left the

lovely girl without quite falling in love with her, and though I

know he was sorry and would have given all his old boots and

shoes to have the thing to do over again, yet it was past; and

all hope of anything of that sort is dead as a herring.

  As to that "partly promised" article you speak of, I'll bear it

in mind to jog his memory if he should show any signs of for-

getfulness.  It's just such a pleasant little trick as he would like

to be guilty of in behalf of a sister whom he thinks a strain or

two higher than perfection itself and loves as well as I do my

sweetheart, but then that standstill inertia feature of his may

prevent him from doing what he would delight to do, unless

some of us prick him on a little.

  You speak of Sophia (your sister and my cousin) and her

husband Gilbert.   Sophy is indeed one of the "great" girls and

if she has a lord worthy of her--they say she has,--their

little home ought to contain as much happiness to the cubic foot

as any other house under the moon. No doubt it does. I can

see her "in my mind's eye" as real as life as she slipped along

over the shining snow which cracked under our feet as we









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          181</B>



trudged down from Grandmother's to her then home last winter

a year ago. I'd go without my dinner to see you and her once

again tonight.  I hardly remember when I saw you last.  The

most distinct recollection I have of you is about the time we took

that ramble on the mountains and saw the horrendum monstrum,

etc., and how crazy we all were with delight!  But those times

are past.  Not but that just as good times are coming in the

future.  But then we all love to talk about the good old times.

"All times when old are good," and I expect one day to look

back on the enjoyments of the present with as much of regret as

I now do upon the past. Why not? To be sure, we've no girls

here,--sisters, cousins, or sweethearts, absolutely none,--that I

ever expect to remember with any other feelings than those of

the most perfect indifference; yet, still, this free and easy old-

bachelor sort of life is quite full of fun and jollity.  Pease and

myself room together; and everything like order and neatness

is banished from our presence as a nuisance--old letters and

old boots and shoes, duds clean and duds dirty, books and

newspapers, tooth-brushes, shoe-brushes, and clothes-brushes,

all heaped together on chairs, settees, etc., in dusty and "most

admired confusion."    Now, what is there imaginable in clean,

tidy private life equal to this? Do you wonder that John R. is

slow to leave such happy quarters?  If you could but see how

like "pigs in clover" we live, you'd never speak of the girls to

him again.

  A Mr. Stem, a friend of ours, went from these "diggin's" to

B. [Brattleboro] to try the water cure. If you should happen to

become acquainted with him, he can give you a particular descrip-

tion of our mode of life in this "mud village."

  I would have left a line for John R. if I had thought he would

write a word, but though he appreciates the luxury of reading,

writing is altogether too much like work for his temperament.

--Love to Sophy and Grandma. Write to us bach's again, do.

              Sincerely, your affectionate cousin,

                                              RU'D B. HAYES.

  MISS JANETTE ELLIOT,

     West Brattleboro, Vermont.









<B>182          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                    LOWER SANDUSKY, September 2, [1846].

  DEAR  SISTER:--We  are very anxious to hear from you.

Write a few words at least to let us know that you are well. I

have taken up my pen a dozen times in the last two weeks to

write to you and then postponed it for the next mail. It is said

Columbus is quite sickly. We fear you are suffering in some

way from sickness. We are all well. Not heard from Mother

in a month. If you or brother William are taken much sick, let

us hear from you, and Uncle or myself or both will come down--

I am just starting for Tiffin.

            In haste.--Your affectionate brother,

                                            R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                    LOWER SANDUSKY, September 27, 1846.

  MY  DEAR SISTER:--Uncle urges me to write today  for he

says General Bell has heard it is very sickly in Columbus and

he is anxious to hear whether you are all well or not; and I

was thinking that perhaps you had heard similar reports about

our place and might be pleased to hear that we are "well and

hope these few lines," etc.

  I was at Sandusky City a few days ago; called [on] Lizzy, of

course; found her looking remarkably well and happy and so

glad to see me, apparently, that an hour slipped off in about five

minutes' chat, dissolved in about ten minutes' laughter.  I did

not see her liege lord, but suppose he spends his time impartially

in attending to his own and his lady's "externals." They live in

a large old-fashioned brick house painted a deep velvet red; well

furnished in the old style, with musical instruments scattered

about in all the apartments,--at least, in all that I peeped into,

--with a great profusion of handsomely bound volumes of

"works" lying on the tables, etc., etc.  You can easily see how I

had an opportunity to make these observations, for relying upon

"old experience," I bet with the girl, in whose company I called,

a pound of sugar that if we were the first callers that morning,

we should be compelled to wait twenty minutes before Lizzy

would make her appearance.      Of course, I won the bet, and

employed the anxious time in taking "notes." The mother-in-









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          18</B>3



law, Mrs. Campbell, is a well appearing Episcopal old lady whose

faith in the divine perfections of her minister seemed much re-

vived--if such faith as hers is capable of revival--by a remark

of my lady's that she thought him "a very evangelical (?)

preacher." Upon hearing the word "evangelical" in that con-

nection, I could not but think of old Polonius' soliloquy upon an

expression used by one of the players in Hamlet--"mobled

Queen  of Troy."     "Aye,"  says he,  "mobled--mobled  is a

good word.     Mobled queen is good."

  Lizzy says she expects Julia Buttles to pay her a visit soon.

Julia is reported to be a "great go" in Cleveland--a striking il-

lustration of the scriptural adage, "a prophet is not without honor

save in his own country."

  We have not heard whether or not Mother has left Vermont,

nor whether William has gone East or not. Said [Uncle], "You

sit straight down and tell us about these things." I'd give a

couple of shillings to be with you a while next month, but probably

shall not. By the by, tell us when Hatty'll be married, whether

she is to be given enough to have a "flare-up" on the occasion,

etc. Her favorite of the Delaware lassies is on Kelly's Island,

I've understood,--Webb, I forget her first name.         [Not the

Lucy Webb, who was six years later to become his wife.] She

is said to be a perfect steamboat, or rather "a propeller," like

Dalila in "Samson Agonistes," sailing,



           "With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,

            Canvas [sails] filled, and streamers waving,

            Courted by all the winds, etc.";

"with a feather in her cap, like a flag in her top, to tell, I think,

which way the winds will blow."

  I'd like to see Hatty again before she goes into exile forever.

What a sacrifice she will have to make in giving up her "fetch-

ings" and her "catchings," her coquetry and her conquests,--or

will she give them up?  As William's Connecticut friend says of

Wilcox's piety, "I hope so. I don't know, but I hope so."

  I've not yet made up my mind whether to go to Columbus in

November when the United States Court sits, or wait until about

New Year's. I am quite in a humor to see you as well as my









<B>184          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



"quiet girls" again, not meaning Lolly and Will [his sister's chil-

dren]. Love to 'em.

                  Your affectionate brother,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--I wrote to Janette Elliot just "for case" one day and

got a letter in reply which I just thought I'd send ye.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.





  Lower Sandusky, October 4, 1846.--I have looked back through

my diary to see what I said on other birthdays. I do not find that

I wrote anything a year ago. If I did not let the day pass off

without recollecting that I was then entering on my twenty-fourth

year I must have written something. I hope I shall find it some-

where.

  I hardly know what to write today. A year ago I expected to

be married before this time. I wish I were now a married man.

I have had no loves as yet. Before another birthday I am resolved

at least to make a choice. I've said enough on this topic to show

what is now uppermost in my thoughts. I know of two fine

girls, either of whom I might love. F. G. P --, who is engaged

already to another, I fear, and Car'l W--, whose acquaintance

I made last winter.

  I still have the same or similar feelings, desires, hopes, and

views in looking forward into the future that I have had for

several years. I still feel young, cheerful, and boyish. Still make

good resolutions in regard to study, habits, etc., etc., and still

break them as of old. In the practice of law, I am in partnership

with Ralph P. Buckland, a sound lawyer, without ostentation or

brilliancy; of excellent principles, strict integrity; an inveterate

politician, Whig (of course); every way an estimable man, but

with a slight infirmity of temper which makes him enemies, but

which has never been exhibited towards me.

  What of the past? I have succeeded, in all the senses of that

word, as well as I could desire in my professional career; but

I have not by labor, application, and energy deserved success as

I ought. I've studied less, trifled more, been changeable, fickle-









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          185</B>



minded, and heedless in many things. This is partly in conse-

quence of certain incipient courtships; smitten, but not in love;

fancy pleased and tickled and heart untouched. Reflection and

observation prevented anything serious, at the same time that

there was enough to unhinge the fixed habits of the mind, etc.

Besides that, for the last two months or three, we have, in com-

mon with the whole West, suffered here from the prevalence of

fevers, etc., which destroyed everything like systematic energy

in any pursuit.





                          LOWER SANDUSKY, October 4, 1846.

  MY DEAR FANNY:--I am writing with my partner's gold pen.

and if I write you a cold, stiff letter you must not attribute it

to a muddy head or a hard heart. It's the pen that's to blame

not me myself. Two notions have induced me to write you again

so soon.  I am twenty-four years old today--only think of it!

--and then as your husband is away and the evenings lonesome,

I thought a poor letter now would be better than a very good one

a couple of weeks hence. If I could think of anything right

pretty to say about my birthday, I'd certainly say it. It is an

occasion to make one look backwards and forwards, to call up

sad thoughts, strange and mournful feelings, "thick coming fan-

cies of the future," and "a' that." Well, if you were where I am,

or I were where you are, or if we were together anywhere, I

might perhaps talk off in quite a sentimental strain to you, but as

it is, the thing can't "be did" (Pease). So if you want to be filled

with sensations "a'most" like mine, just read some fine piece of

poetry of a mournful cast and you will probably catch the infec-

tion.

  The notion that is uppermost in the medley of ideas that are

rolling about under my hair, is that before a year runs round I'll

get me "a wifey" or at least a sweetheart, if I can find one who

agrees with me in thinking that I'm one of the "sunniest" fellows

in the world; and along, quite a piece behind that notion, is the

notion that I'll try to be a little better lawyer at the end of an-

other year. Then there are a lot of fancies making quite a bulk.

  News! The sick folks are all well (a little Irish) or getting









<B>186          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



well. No more fevers this year. People who suffer from colds

are now getting their portion. Uncle is a little unwell today in

consequence of the change of weather. No other news "perceiv-

able."

  You should have had Pease with you to enjoy your convocation

of Presbyterians. He hates a Presbyterian worse than he does a

Whig. I mean, of course, in the abstract. In the concrete he

admits he occasionally finds a clever Whig and a tolerable Pres-

byterian; but the "clargy" and deacons you had were very ab-

stract, I take it, from your description.

  I am going to Sandusky again tomorrow. Mrs. Campbell did

"impress" me a good deal as she did you. What I meant by "an

Episcopal lady" was "a female embodiment of propriety," and

"nothing else." I suppose "evangelical" does mean something. I

was afraid it might when I heard it, and so I said nothing. I

only thought what I wrote you.

  The young lady's name is Fanny--a well sounding name in

my ear; but not Fanny Hayes and probably never will be. The

other name might be Smith or Snooks, you would be none the

wiser if I were to tell it to you.

  I'm obliged to Mrs. Sparrow  for her offer of her eleven-

pounder, but I'd prefer a sister she has if it's just the same to

her. You speak of my not enquiring of or about Miss Willis.

Why, I think more of and about her than I do of or about any

girl of my acquaintance, with one exception. What more would

you ask?

  Oh, pshaw! I don't feel like writing, especially with this vile

pen. It's worse than the gold one I threw down a minute ago,

and I've no knife in these Sunday breeches' pockets and can't

mend it, so good-bye.

                Your Twenty-Four-Year Old-Brother,

                                                      RUD.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.





  October 9, 1846.--I have been travelling about the country

several days and do not feel like employing myself about any-

thing serious this evening. In looking back to the 3rd of July,









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          187</B>



1841, I see that I then spoke of a difficulty between the North-

erners and Southerners at college, that it began by some differ-

ence between "a noble, warm-hearted Kentuckian and the orator

of the day."    That  "noble,  warm-hearted  Kentuckian" was

Thomas M. Kane. Last winter he was killed in a duel at New

Orleans. The difficulty arose out of a dispute in a ballroom

about positions!  Kane  left college before graduating, com-

menced studying law in the office of an uncle at New Orleans,

was admitted to the bar, had begun practice under the most

favorable auspices, and his friends were full of hope that a career

of honorable professional success was before him, when he was

thus cut off.

  I remember his parting words to me. We had walked through

the mud from Mount Vernon to Sunbury in the spring of the

great political year (1840). I was about to leave for Delaware.

Kane spoke of his sorrow at parting, but was sanguine of meeting

me again somewhere. His ambitious hopes were expressed in his

farewell. "Good-bye, Hayes, we shall meet on the floor of Con-

gress."  He is the first college friend whose death I have had to

mourn. His best epitaph would be, "He was a noble, warm-

hearted Kentuckian."





                       LOWER SANDUSKY, November 2, 1846.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I see by your letter of the 22d ult. that you

seem to expect me to visit Columbus about the middle of this

month. If I said in my last anything looking that way it must

have been that I could not leave here before that time, for I have

never intended to go down until the fore part of December. I

cannot conveniently leave here until that time; besides it will be

pleasanter at Columbus about that time than earlier in the winter.

  Uncle and John R. are both in fine health. I think cousin John

will come to Columbus about the 8th of January. He is afraid

that his party will desert the hard-money issue, and being himself

one of the hardest of the hards he could not bear to see such

dereliction from duty!!

  I am going to Perrysburg in the morning, and to Maumee again

in two weeks. I am enjoying myself excellently well these days.









<B>188          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



It is church time and I must quit. I go regularly to church.

Good-bye for the present.

                        Your affectionate son,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  We are of course very glad that the State of Ohio has gone

Whig again, not so much because of the good the Whigs will be

likely to do, as because of the mischief which they will prevent.

Besides it will make Columbus more gay and pleasant. The new

editor of the States appears to be an able writer, but a poor tac-

tician. I am glad to see him scalping that old pagan, Ben Tappan.

What is Mat Gilbert looking forward to as the Ultima Thule

of his political existence?

  I hope Brother William will soon be rid of anxiety on the

subject of his lawsuit.--Love to all,--R. B. H.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                      LOWER SANDUSKY, November 22, 1846.

  DEAR FANNY:--I intended to have seen you again Tuesday

morning before I left, but I did not see the coach leave the office

until it was too late. There were six passengers in our stage,

Dr. Case, a Mr. Whittlesey to whom I was introduced at Mr.

Andrews', two members of the Board of E. [Education] and

another very well-behaved man in whom Mother would have

found an able ally in the temperance cause. The company being

so good the journey was of course pleasant. At Sunbury I

stepped into Mr. Bennett's but found the bird was flown and then

recollected to have heard at Columbus that she was visiting her

friends at Marion. Arrived at Mount Vernon early in the

evening, we (Dr. Case and myself) went into a barber shop to

trim up a trifle, when we learned (barbers you know are gossips

by profession) all that was said and thought of Sarah Shepherd's

wedding, etc. etc., and that she had a great party there that eve-

ning; but Dr. Case could not be persuaded to be very anxious to

bolt in uninvited, so the information was of no benefit in the

concrete.

  The next morning we went out to Gambier and spent the day

most gloriously. Kenyon seems to be flourishing again. I need









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          189</B>



not say that I was pleased to see the improvements made and

making. The students were the most genteel in appearance of

any equal number of youngsters I ever saw. Among other new

things is a military company, trained by Professor Ross, which

is far superior to anything I ever saw of the kind. They, by

constant practice, have become so skillful in handling heavy artil-

lery muskets, that they can load and fire by platoons when running

at the top of their speed, and can load and fire when lying flat

upon their backs as rapidly as if upright. This exercise, I think,

has done much to give them that manly bearing which particularly

struck me. In the evening I visited one of my old societies. I

felt like a sophomore again--all things conducted as of old.

'Twas very pleasant--very.      I shall not fail to visit Gambier

often, if I am always as much gratified as I was this time.

  Next morning I posted off as fast as a horse could carry me in

the rain to reach Mount Vernon in time for the stage. Found

Judge Lane and some four or five Board of Education folks

fellow passengers and reached Sandusky in the cars in a heavy

snowstorm about supper time. Spent evening and forenoon of

the next day running about Sandusky, and in the afternoon came

up the river in Billy Webb's boat, gossiping all the way up with

him about my pickings-up concerning our common acquaintances.

Altogether, I set the trip down as one of the pleasantest. Gam-

bier, you perceive, fills a much larger place in my affections than

Delaware. There is no mystery in the love which mountaineers

always bear for their mountain homes; those great natural ob-

jects do not change with time; but a level country if in the prog-

ress of settlement becomes a stranger's face after a ten years'

absence. They can improve Gambier, but it will only be my old

friend in a new garment; the "old Hill" will always stand.

  I found Uncle and Pease in good health, and amused them

"some" in giving a secondhand edition of Mother's travels and

a specimen of her apostrophes on hearing my tales about Pease's

brandy tippling.

  There was a fair got up this evening to pay a preacher which

went off in good style. I spoke to but one lady and but one word

to her--her name, "Mrs. Eddy."  I beg pardon, I did ask Mrs.

Edgerton to bring me a spoon! That was social! I forgot to









<B>190          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



mention how glad some half dozen old maids at Gambier, who

have been courted by the gallants of ten classes in succession,

were to see me, etc., etc. Love to all. Peek-a-boo to Lolly and

Willie. It is raining dismally and you can imagine how glad I

am to find myself at home.

                               Your affectionate brother,

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.                               R. B. HAYES.



  [With reference to the "brandy tippling" spoken of in the

foregoing letter, it is to be remarked: Hayes's mother was in-

tensely devoted to the temperance cause. Hayes, who was always

most temperate, in his love of fun, took delight in mildly teasing

his mother by hints of his own libations and wild exaggerations

of his friends' convivial habits. This is to be borne in mind in all

such instances as the present.]



                       LOWER SANDUSKY, December 14, 1846.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I received Fanny's letter a couple of weeks

ago and, having nothing in particular to reply, I thought I would

direct this one to you. If you can't read it, it's all one. I do

not intend to say anything; and even if I should spill ink over half

a sheet and cut it out for fear of blotting the rest, don't feel

troubled about it for I will this time take good care to save it un-

til it gets dry and send it on by the next mail. If you will send

me the dimensions of the piece that was missing in my last I

will blot you a piece of equal size and send it on. It will answer

just as well.

  I don't care anything about shirt-bosoms or patterns as long

as I stay at home.  I only want them for the sake of my friends

when I visit you at Columbus. If you will see that I am well

supplied while there I'll not tease you about any others; and, if

you can't furnish me them during that time, I can't come. No-

body here knows anything about shirt-bosoms! When I am

away from you I am, as Prince Henry said Poins was, "at a

low ebb for linen, and the inventory of my shirts is, one for

superfluity and the other for use."

  As for documents left by Mr. Gregory, the mails are open,

and my credit at the postoffice is still good. At all events I guess









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1846          191</B>



the statistics are worth the postage, so if I don't come down I

wish you would send me by mail anything he may have left of

that sort.

  Fanny speaks of your frequent allusions to what I said about

Pease's drinking. Now Pease wishes me [to] set your mind

entirely at ease about him as he is only a moderate drinker;

but he wishes me to add, you have a brother and a son here

who might, he thinks, "be benefited, if not too far gone, by

some of your advice." Indeed, he feels at times a good deal of

apprehension about them; and he would be glad of an oppor-

tunity of discussing the matter with you over a bottle of Ma-

deira,--or do you prefer cordial?

  Uncle's health is about as usual.  People generally healthy.

Our place presents quite a contrast with Sandusky City and

other places of the same size these days.  Our streets look as

Columbus does market days--crowded with Abs  [?].

  I was at Sandusky a few days ago but had no time to call on

Lizzy. Her lord said she was glad to get home again. I was

told that the only difference which marriage caused in Mr.

Campbell was that his hair is now so combed as to hide a little

bald spot there was on his crown! Slander, of course.

  By the way, Mother, there is an extract from "Punch's Pocket

Book for 1847" in the Intelligencer for December 1, which if

you have not read, I hope you will hunt it up and give it a serious

hearing. It contains my notions "to a T."

  I do not know when I shall go down to Columbus. I have

no business which requires me to be there. My partner has a

little child very sick or he would go down tomorrow. He will

probably go down soon. He is a good lawyer and in every par-

ticular one of the best men in the world. His appearance is about

as much against him as Seabury Ford's, but he is a much big-

ger man in point of mind. I don't know of a man whose main

traits of character would come so near meeting the ideas of the

different members of Mr. Platt's family. In matters pertain-

ing to business, politics, etc., he is brother William exactly. In

his habits and notions about temperance, early rising, etc., etc.,

he'll suit you, and in having things decent and in good taste,

Fanny will find him to her mind. I think he will be down in









<B>192          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



the course of a week, but he is now in some fear of losing his

youngest child; he is a sickly little fellow and can hardly live,

I think.

  We cannot both be away at once, so I fear I shall not be able

to gad about  New  Year's--the day  I would most prefer to

spend in Columbus.

             Good-bye.--Your affectionate  son,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--Pease wishes me to say further that I am a good

deal bloated; thinks it strange you did not notice my red face!

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.





  December 23, 1846.--The old year is waning, the new draw-

ing on. My partner has gone to Columbus and several days past

I have spent alone.  There is but little office business at this

season of the year and the days and long winter evenings pass

off slowly, almost too slowly. I read some law, some poetry

(Shakespeare), and play chess occasionally. Somehow my facul-

ties are so dull that nothing but chess seems to excite the atten-

tion enough to arouse them [at] all. It surprises me when I

think of it. What a world of time and brains are wasted in

idle daydreams, castle-building, visions of happiness too rap-

turous for reality. Am I in love, that it grows on me, or is it

habit rioting unchecked? Strange that one should know the

folly, nay, the fatal influence of a pernicious habit on the mental

energies and yet cling to it when a simple act of will would

leave one free! If in love, where's the sweetheart? Is it the

noble-hearted  F--  or the giddy, young, black-eyed  E-  who

fills my thoughts? Do feeling and judgment go together? I

feel the strong longing, but not the fixed attachment which be-

longs to the true love. The settled object is wanting. It is use-

less to attempt to cast myself free from the cords which a too

warm imagination throws about me. The only cure is mar-

riage. If that is not the specific I may as well despair of ever

making even a respectable figure in life; for now in spite of all

my  advantages,--a happy disposition, fair abilities, and good









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          193</B>



principles,--I am almost wholly worthless.  The end of the

week finds me no wiser than the first day, no more fitted to dis-

charge the duties of my profession, no more able to be useful in

the ordinary walks of life.

  I feel as if something was approaching in the future which is

to determine my fortunes hereafter, and over which I have no

control. What an ecstasy this is! With me too, believing as I

do, or have, that it was a part of my patrimony to be gifted

with more than the ordinary allotment of what is called "com-

mon sense." I must be in the chrysalis state, neither a boy nor

a man; not in love and yet not whole of heart. Well, I hope I

shall be safely delivered soon, for if I am not, woe to the future!





                     LOWER SANDUSKY, January 24, 1847.

  DEAR MOTHER:--The weather has been so beautiful today

that I almost failed to give you a letter. It has been too cold to

be caught out for more than a week, and now that it is once

more tolerable one feels like improving it.

  Nothing has occurred since the flood worth naming except

the dedication, etc.,  of the new Presbyterian house.  It is a

very pretty one. So pretty, and the minister is such a clever

fellow, that I've already heard seven sermons in it although this

is but the third Sunday of its going off. This you will admit

is doing well, especially as there are no pretty girls there. It

would raise your opinion of Lower Sandusky to see what good

congregations--good in numbers--meet there.  We  are im-

proving in that particular. I have hopes of living to see the

place at least half civilized one of these afternoons.

  Uncle's health has been better than usual this winter.  He

talks of going to Columbus when the weather is milder, but his

talking about leaving home means no more than yours does.

  John R. is as happy as usual; very anxious to get a wife;

would take e'en a'most anybody that any friend would recom-

mend, provided always that she isn't more than seventeen

years old and has no "poor relations"!

  The decision of our lawsuit, of which you have heard enough

I suppose, caused about as great rejoicing in some forty families

   13









<B>194          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



as the success of Brother William's did in his. We better "a' died"

than lost it and there was proportionate glory in success.

  I've not been away from home since Christmas. Quite a

stay-at-home sort of a body I'm growing to be,--"quite domes-

tic," as they say of housewives, or quite domesticated, as they

say of wild beasts. I shall not be likely to run about much until

in the spring. Just when I shall stray off to Columbus I couldn't

tell, but probably not until I enlist for the Mexican War; a

thing I have a notion of doing, for it looks very much as if they

couldn't get along without me.

  Nothing more to say at this time. Hope you will venture out

here now that we have a fine Presbyterian Church.

                   Your affectionate son,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--Whatever you do with the Delaware  folks don't sue

them. None but very green people ever go to law to get their

rights.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



  February 1, 1847.--When I last wrote [in my diary] I must

have been in a murky mood. Since that time I've had an un-

derstanding with my "n. h. [noble-hearted] F--," and though

present circumstances put an end to "a' that," still there is a

"fixed" prospect ahead! Now, being free of such distracting in-

fluences, what is to prevent my applying myself heart and soul

to my profession? Or rather have I not every encouragement

for resolute, patient, continued exertion? Then, let me master

perfectly every case we now have in court, still try to increase

my familiarity with the German, and apply myself to the faithful

study of the law. If I cannot do it now, I never can expect to

do it. . . .



                     LOWER SANDUSKY, February 16, 1847.

  MY DEAR MOTHER:--Your letter written to be sent by some

one who was at Columbus from here was received on the same

day with Fanny's letter. I wish I was at Columbus now to run









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          195</B>



about with Leonora. I am afraid though that I should be fall-

ing in love with her, which would be quite inconvenient at this

time. . . .

  I am sorry to hear that your eyes appear to be failing. Uncle

is troubled in the same way. That is the reason why he does not

write oftener to you. He relies upon me to do up the genteel

with his correspondents. You will perhaps have to rely in the

same way upon Fanny, and as I write a very blind scrawl, she

will have to be reader-general for you; just as in the navy there

are tasters-general to try the quality of the cooking done for

the common sailors. . . .

  We are jogging along as usual here, except there is a great

dearth of weddings, funerals, and parties. I believe there are

sewing societies at which some of the young folks try to "spark"

a little, but I have not attended any of them. We had a few

sleigh-rides into the Swamp while our late snow was on the

ground, and if I thought it would be interesting, I might try

to describe to you the eating, kissing, playing button and blind-

hood, screaming, giggling, singing, and the other elegant diver-

sions, which were resorted to [to] give spice and pith to the

aforesaid sleigh-rides. But as a description of such scenes would

hardly interest you as much as the dedication of a church, and

inasmuch as such solemnities are of rare occurrence hereaway, I

am likely to send you a very dry letter today.

  Uncle comes down every good day and teases Cousin John

about the war, lieutenant general, etc., etc., and about a pair

of fancy chequered pants which Pease had the assurance to get

into the last time he was at New York. Pease has no retort to

the political slants, but in the wardrobe assault he makes vigor-

ous defence by describing Uncle's "consumption coat," as he

calls a certain drab (yellow) fur-collared overcoat which he says

Uncle keeps nicely brushed to wear only in fine weather. Pease's

drinking and gambling are also excellent topics for raillery

which forms an important item in the intercourse of these two

old bachelors.

  I am glad to learn that you have a couple [of] new shirts for

me. It will be likely to take me to Columbus to get them, for I









<B>196          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



am sadly in want of such things, whenever I have business which

compels me to go down into the settlements.

  Poor Hatty! She ought to write a book. A belle gone into

a mud-hole where there is nobody to "fetch" and where it would

be thought improper for her to try to "fetch" anybody!  It

must be perfect misery.

  Uncle has set all our heathens, who read anything except the

Statesman and Democrat, to reading Swedenborgian tracts and

Professor Bush's writings. The views of the New Church are

extremely popular. Men who were unwilling to believe their

own existence, swallow these sublime mysteries without a

"strain." We shall probably not build a church consecrated to

the new views just yet; but we may come to that complexion

hereafter. We shall be a pious folk when all our infidels and

atheists become "disciples." . . . .

  I see by Fanny's letter that my favorite little girls have all

"come out," as they say.  I should have to look about for new

sweethearts. This "coming out" seems to spoil the best of 'em.

Miss Willis is still "out" too. It is time, I should say, that she

was "off." Now, to hear that Lizzie B. is still in the field seems

quite natural and proper--one is used to it. But Miss W.

ought to beware or she will find herself an "old girl" some day.

  What has gone with Julia Buttles this winter? Has she not

honored Columbus with her presence? There must have been

a void in the space she was wont to fill and it may not be too

much to presume that said void "ached." At least I should

think it would.

  I rode about twenty miles this forenoon in a cold driving rain

that froze as it fell, and got home so late that I've had no din-

ner (but it's 'most time for tea), and though in the best of

humor "tongue-ward," I find that "pen-ward" I am, like Iago,

"nothing if not critical."--Good-bye.

                   Your affectionate son,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          197</B>



  Lower Sandusky, March 10, 1847.--"Nor am I sure, not-

withstanding all the sentimental flights of novel writers and the

sage philosophy of moralists, whether we are capable of so in-

timate and cordial a condition of friendship as that one man may

pour out his bosom, his every thought and fleeting fancy, his very

inmost soul with unreserved confidence to another, without

hazard of losing part of that respect which man deserves from

man; or from the unavoidable imperfections attending human

nature, of one day repenting his confidence. For these reasons

I am determined to make these pages my confidant."  [Source

of quotation not given.]

  To these seemingly invidious but too just ideas of human

friendship, I would make one exception--the connection  be-

tween two persons of different sexes, when their interests are

united and absorbed by the tie of love.

      "When thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,

       And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart."

  Then confidence, confidence that exalts them the more in one

another's opinion, that endears them the more to each other's

hearts, unreservedly "reigns and revels."



      LOWER SANDUSKY, Sunday Morning, March 22, 1847.

                                             "Cold as ice."

  MY DEAR FANNY:--Mother in her last says you are waiting

to hear from me before you write again, and she also says I

owe her a letter or two on arrearages. I have been in the habit

of thinking that the last sheet balanced all "gone-bys," and that

a letter to one of the household was the property of all, except

under certain peculiar circumstances when there is a special sav-

ing clause to meet the case.

  This lovely (?) village has been dirtier than usual this spring,

the roads worse than before in years, and the weather as un-

certain as a woman. Natheless I am enjoying it well. We

have had a good many soirees within the past six weeks, all

which of course were honored with my presence. They were

in some respects quite like the same article in Columbus and









<B>198          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



in others as unlike as well could be. If I were in your big rock-

ing-chair and you sitting in William's lap at the right time of

day--or night rather--for elated spirits, we might smile over

the items of curious matters that I could give you a history of.

I'm quite sure that you never saw just such doings as we have.

Ditto of our rowdy sleigh-rides.

  But perhaps the best sport I have had in which the women-

kind were concerned was in an examination of witnesses in the

case of our late Presbyterian minister's lady against her lord for

divorce. Extreme cruelty and neglect of duty were the causes

assigned. The real difficulty was Mrs. B. had some property

which [the] Rev. Mr. B. was resolved to get and she equally re-

solved to keep, and there was an eternal squabble between them

for it. Finally her "sistren" in the church persuaded her to apply

for a divorce and trumped up for causes a dispute about peas,

a chicken, some rain water,--a quarrel in which the word "old

hag" was used, etc., etc. In short, the causes set up were a

string of old women's gossip, and during the week past we have

been taking the testimony of all the pious old Presbyterian ladies

as to what they knew or have heard of the matter.  The story

began with the first interview the parties ever had and so traced

them through the courtship up to their final voluntary separa-

tion.  Each of the old ladies was anxious to tell what she said to

Mrs. Backus, and how she gave Mr. Backus a bit of her mind,

and how she foresaw it all, and so on, and so on for four pages

of the richest sort of gossip. We had to take with us as our

officer a young lawyer, who left the rod of the pedagogue for

the law, and who was constantly trying to twist the answers of

our respectable old ladies into good grammatical English. This

we insisted was all wrong--that the answers should be written

as they were given, etc. The ladies too felt a little piqued at the

notion that they couldn't reply for themselves; so that we suc-

ceeded in getting it down "ses I" and "ses she" equal to a Mother

Caudle's lecture. It fell to me to read over one old lady's deposi-

tion to her before she signed it. There were three young ladies

present. I tried to make it sound as nicely as possible, but pretty

soon the girls began to giggle, and at one peculiarly fine passage,

lawyers, girls, and all, unable to keep it down, burst out into a









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          199</B>



most boisterous and unanimous laugh. It took hard coaxing to

pacify the lady but we succeeded in getting her name to it.

  Tomorrow is the first day of court and my mind is too full

of business to get up a good letter. . . .  You must not

expect any more long letters from me until next winter. We

are too busy in the summer.

                  Your affectionate brother,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--We had a most glorious Irish supper got up by the

ladies at the court-house. Raised two hundred fifty dollars for

relief--St. Patrick's Day, 17th. [It was the time of the great

famine in Ireland.]

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                        LOWER SANDUSKY, April 13, 1847.

  MY DEAR FANNY:--I should not write you this beautiful

week-day afternoon, if it were not that reading the accounts

given in the last two  Intelligencers of the recent battle at Buena

Vista and the sad reflections contained in several articles on the

deaths of Hardin, Clay, Lincoln, and other noble spirits, to-

gether with General Taylor's letter of condolence to Clay, has un-

fitted me for ordinary scribbling.  The  southern mail reached

here at noon today, and as I had not read any of the war news

since a week ago Saturday, when we received the first authentic

account of Taylor's victory, I undertook to read up after dinner

and have just finished the perusal of all that seemed inviting

with feelings nearly akin, I imagine, to those which Mother is

in the habit of indulging. I will spare you any attempt at the

melancholy for if you have read the Intelligencer you have cer-

tainly had enough.     Besides, aside from all this, I am--or

should be--in one of what you term my most unsentimentally

jolly moods.

  I received a letter from "Brother John" (Little) a few days

ago telling me of his intended visit to Lizzy. I took the hint and

went to Sandusky Saturday, spent Sunday and returned home

last evening. Miss Julia Buttles was there and intends going to

Columbus with Lizzy and John. She is looking somewhat bet-









<B>200          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ter than when I last saw her but has not lost her unfortunate

habit of courting all the youngsters who come within her sphere.

My visit was of course a very pleasant one. Sunday afternoon,

instead of going to church, we paraded the streets and dove

down among the wharves, schooners, etc., John doing the gen-

teel for Miss Julia and Lizzy looking to me for the same in the

absence of her lord, who as a strict Episcopalian and organist

was of necessity compelled to forego the pleasure. I thought he

(Mr. Campbell) for a few moments lost his wonted good nature

when he heard of our ramble, especially when Julia informed

him that his lady was in charge of one of her first and most

favored admirers! But he soon regained his good humor and

we spent the evening in a most uproarious and jolly manner--

receiving smiles of approbation from Father Campbell and des-

perate imitations thereof from Mother Campbell at each un-

usually noisy burst.

  You will hardly recognize John on his return as he lost those

whiskers. He is "one of 'em," as the b'hoys say of glorious good

fellows, either with or without that appendage.

  I have formed no plans for the summer; do not expect to

leave here more than a day or two at a time except on business

unless I should be troubled with some of our river complaints.

As for study, elegant literature, and the like, you know I do not

expect ever to become a literary man in the sense that you and

I understand the term,--no, nor even according to Hatty's no-

tions which you remember were a little singular. I shall never-

theless try to be enough of a scholar to be a gentleman, fit to

associate with gentlemen and ladies too. More than this I do

not expect nor care for. "Laughing and cracking jokes" is cer-

tainly one of the 'scape-pipes for exuberant spirits which I am

fond of patronizing, but very far from being my "main occupa-

tion." If not making very striking progress in knowledge, I yet

think there is no fear of a backward motion for some time even

in this atmosphere, which I confess is not unfavorable to the

"retrograde" movement you speak of. If, however, you had

chanced to write sagely on such a topic, I would have lent a

willing ear to your "woman's wisdom" and not attempted to

terrify you with a caricature of your views. There are some









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          201</B>



things, nay  many things, connected with all the squabbles  of

poor mortals, from the wars of nations down to the petty war-

fare of gossiping tongues, so intrinsically ludicrous that nothing

would induce a man of plain good sense to speak seriously of

them, if it were not for the misery which they cause.  I had

not much respect for disputation when I commenced the study of

law; but had it been much greater than it was, a year's ob-

servation in a law office would have fairly cured me of it. And

so it is that in speaking of such things, it is as natural to fall into

a vein of ridicule as it is for the rivers to seek the sea.

  "Despatches de l'Orient" I have not looked for nor even

thought of since the last received from you; nevertheless the star

"the wise men" saw is likely to be as "bright and particular" as

ever, so long as the morning star of hope shines brighter to my

eye than the evening star of memory.

  Mother's temperance documents were "thankfully received,"

as country merchants say of "small favors"; but Pease was

afraid to read them lest they should make him dry and thereby

place him in the path of temptation. But you can assure Mother

that all of her friends here will vote right whenever they have

an opportunity to vote at all; not that we consider it a matter

of great moment whether spirituous liquor is sold legally in

consequence of lax laws, as is now the case, or illegally in con-

sequence of lax officers as would probably be the case (at least

hereabouts) if no licenses were granted. But we should vote

"anti" for the looks and name of the thing.

  I find I am spinning quite a yarn about nothing at all. We

have no local news except in the way of "sad accidents." Mrs.

Bell (Sarah's Mother), an elderly lady, was very badly burned

by her clothes taking fire yesterday or the day before, but is

not thought to be in danger.

                   Love to all. Good-bye.

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--I was thinking the other day of the tendency which

some creeds have to cultivate a fondness for the horrible in re-

ligion as distinguished from the lovely--contrasting Methodism

or Presbyterianism with Swedenborgianism. One sentence in









<B>202          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Mother's last, which perhaps you did not see, struck me as il-

lustrating this distinction. She says "our soldiers and all other

persons should be prepared for death and all the other horrors

that await them!"

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                          LOWER SANDUSKY, May 30, 1847.

  DEAR MOTHER: -- It is almost church time, and as here every

one counts, I must not spend much time in letter writing. We

reached  home  Friday  afternoon.     Uncle's health  much  im-

proved--better in fact than before he was taken sick.

Pease and all our other friends here were rejoiced at our re-

turn. The high prices for produce makes our village very lively

and money plenty.

  There is also a world of gossiping about our fine military

company. I am afraid more clever, companionable fellows are

going to Mexico than will be left behind.  I am strongly tempted

to go with them. A year's absence from the office would proba-

bly give me a solid constitution besides the experience in a new

and strange sort of life that I should get.

  Buckland is talking some of going to Sandusky City to open

an office. If he goes we shall continue in partnership. I shall

remain here until our business is settled up in this county and

he has made a good start there, when I shall also pick up my

duds and go to Sandusky City, too. This would probably take

a couple of years. Sandusky City is growing rapidly and this

plan does not seem to be a bad one.

  Speaking of picking up "duds" makes me think of my cloak

about which you were some troubled. I had lent it and it was

duly returned, in my absence.



                                     Monday Morning, 31st.

  DEAR MOTHER:--Since writing the above "a change has

come over the spirit of my dream." I did not tell you--because

I did not wish to give you trouble--when  I was at Columbus,

that for some time I have been suffering from a sore throat,

brought on, as the physicians say, by confinement, etc., in my

office. I did hope that it would be relieved by the applications I









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          203</B>



was making when on my visit home; but I now  find that it is

bleeding again and the doctor says that the relief was but tem-

porary, and that to effect a perfect cure I must leave the office

for a year or two and try an entire change of habits of life, diet,

climate, etc.--such as going to sea or something of that sort.

After consultation with friends and Drs. Rawson and Brown,

it is agreed that the best way I can take is to procure an ap-

pointment in the volunteers, which will clear me from the

drudgery and hardships of a common soldier and at the same

time give me the best opportunity of trying a change of climate

and mode of living, together with pleasant occupation for mind

and body.

  The principal difficulty will be in obtaining such an appoint-

ment as I want. I prefer a lieutenancy to any other appoint-

ment, but I fear I am too late. When I began this letter I thought

there was no chance at all of getting a commission, but there is

some hope for it, I learn, by the promotion of one of the officers

in our company. Uncle thinks I better go down to talk with you

about the matter before making any great efforts about it, but

I do not apprehend much opposition when the advantages and

necessity are understood of my changing habits for a year

or so.

  Do not say a word about this to anybody--the Gilberts es-

pecially--for I may not go at all, etc., etc.

  As soon as the Saturday stage I will either be in Columbus or

you shall hear from me. Do not speak to anyone about expect-

ing me; but seeing I can't be a lawyer I guess I better be a

soldier.--Good-bye.   Affectionately,            

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                         LOWER SANDUSKY, May 31, 1847.

  DEAR BROTHER:--Uncle, I believe, mentioned to you that

confinement in the office during the past year or two had some-

what impaired my health. On my return home the doctors dis-

covering that the remedy I had been trying had done little good,

advised that I must quit the office entirely for a year or two and

begin some new way of life, and Uncle and my other friends

resolved that I should do so. Whether this is wise and neces-









<B>204          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



sary or not, I cannot tell; but as I must quit the office, I choose

to enter the army if I can get a good appointment; and friends,

learned and unlearned, agree that the step is a good one under

the circumstances. Nothing, of course, would tempt me to it if

I could be allowed to remain in the office. But this seems the

cheapest and easiest way of carrying out the plan. If I find it

does not agree with me, or that I am to be sent to a sickly place,

I shall resign. The health of all who went from here a year

ago has improved. I think mine will; if it does not, I shall soon

know it and come home. I wish you and Fanny to do all in your

power to reconcile Mother to it. It is certainly better than going

to sea as a common sailor, which is now constantly tried at the

East. Say nothing at all about this to anyone, and if you can

form an opinion as to the probability of my being able to obtain

Mother's consent in time to send me word by the return mail,

please do so. I shall either write or come down myself Friday

so as to be at Columbus Saturday. The matter must be de-

termined soon or I shall be too late to get such a place as I

wish.  Love to all.           Yours,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  W. A. PLATT.





  Lower Sandusky, June 1, 1847.--I have just determined upon

a very important step--to go to Mexico, if my health will per-

mit, and in case there is any post within my reach, the duties of

which I shall be able to perform. I am induced to this by a

mixture of motives. My friends and those whose advice I was

bound to listen to, have resolved that I shall leave the office for

six months or a year to come, and I can think of no way of

spending that time which is half so tolerable as the life of a

soldier. If I can enjoy health, I shall be most happy and re-

ceive benefit, I am sure. I have no views about war other than

those of the best Christians; and my opinion of this war with

Mexico is that which is common to the Whigs of the North--

Tom Corwin and his admirers of whom I am one. My philoso-

phy has not better principle than that of the old woman who,

while she mourned over her neighbor's calamity, was yet re-









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          205</B>



joiced to be able to witness the conflagration. Whatever doubts

I might otherwise have of the morality of this feeling are en-

tirely swamped in the love of enterprise, etc., etc., which I share

in common with other young men of my age.

  During my school and college days and the last two years'

initiation into the mysteries of practicing law, I have applied

myself with at least an average degree of industry to books and

regular, systematic efforts to improve.      Of  this  I am,  for

a while at all events, full; and feel a satiety similar in some

points, though widely different in its origin, to that felt by Childe

Harold when bidding his "native land good night." I must

sow my wild oats, according to the vulgarism on this subject.

Had I married, as I wish I had, a year ago, I am persuaded this

would not have occurred. My health might have been safe and

myself a well-behaved civilian instead of a rough volunteer.

But as it is, so is it. I now have my eye in a direction which

prevents any immediate consummation of that sort, and I must

be in a strange way of life to keep my thoughts on this subject

from leading to bad results. Whatever other evils may befall

me, I shall now remain as pure as need be. My only regret in

this course, after looking over the whole ground, is the pain it

will give my friends, especially Mother. Uncle will soon view it

as I do and be reconciled; but I fear Mother. God grant that

she may be calm and resigned under any affliction it may bring to

her bosom. I mean to be cool and cheerful in her presence, but

now the thought fills my eyes with tears. Enough--enough.





                                    COLUMBUS, June 6, 1847.

  MY DEAR UNCLE:--I arrived here in good time; found Mother

recovered from her illness, and the rest of the family in good

health. Contrary to my anticipations, I find that Mother is not at

all shocked at my intended Mexican expedition, and though she

would have chosen a different course, will not say a word against

it, if the physicians think it will be safe. Fanny was so nervous

on the subject, that she would not tell Mother about it the first

night of receiving the news, but when told of it, Mother laughed

at Fanny's nervousness, and took it quite as philosophically as I









<B>206          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



could have desired. Fanny's trouble, too, was chiefly on account

of an exaggerated idea of the extent of my ailing. As soon as

she understood that I was not seriously ill, and only needed a

little rusticating, she came over quite easily.

  So, there is nothing in the way now but the advice of physicians

and the risk of obtaining such a post as I can safely venture to

fill. I have not had time to visit anyone yet, and cannot speak

as to the chances of getting such a place; but do not think them

good. I shall leave here Wednesday or Thursday, so you may

direct your letter, in reply to this, to Cincinnati. Notwithstanding

all I have said above, my wishes as to the whole matter are the

same as when I left.           

                              Yours sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                                  CINCINNATI, June  13, 1847.

  MY DEAR UNCLE:--I have been here two or three days enjoy-

ing myself as well as the rainy weather would permit. Dr.

Dresbach is here, and has done  his part in making my  stay

agreeable.  My letters, furnished by Sandusky friends, enabled

me to get favorable introductions from Medary & Beeb to the

leading military characters here; and although there are appli-

cants enough for the crumbs, my chance, if I were to push my

claims, is probably as good as the average; but Dr. Dresbach and

Mussey have so far spoken very discouragingly of the proposed

trip to Mexico. I have not yet given up, and intend to have an-

other talk with Dr. Mussey tomorrow; but there is scarcely any

doubt that I shall have to give up the soldiering after all the

bother of getting friends' consent, etc., etc. A very kind letter

from Judge Lane, in which he speaks very warmly of the matter,

has done more to satisfy me with the doctors' decision than any-

thing else I have received or heard. The judge gave me a very

flattering letter of introduction to Mitchel. [Professor Ormsby

Macknight Mitchel, the famous astronomer, Director of the Cin-

cinnati Observatory.]

  It has been too wet for me to be out much, but there is no fear

of our company's acceptance, even though they lack many men

of the full complement. Brough is certain of being colonel, I









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          207</B>



think; Captain Lilley of Columbus, lieutenant colonel or major. I

fear Thompson has no chance of promotion. Eight or nine com-

panies are here and have settled all the elections, as they think.

They are some vexed at being delayed here by the Sandusky and

Millersburg companies.

  I got nothing new from Dr. Mussey, as to my health except

the probable debility and danger which would result from ex-

posure to the extreme heats of the South. He thinks that a few

months of starvation, and outdoor loafing will set all to rights.

I shall remain here at least a week, and then go into Kentucky,

if my Mexican trip fails. [I] shall not get home again before the

10th of July, if so soon.

  I find friends abundant here between my letters and my old

acquaintances. I received your letter the day of my arrival. I

am glad our company has started. It would be a little too shame-

ful if they were to "cave" now. We shall look for them tomor-

row.                    Yours sincerely,          R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                                 CINCINNATI, June 13, 1847.

  MY DERA SISTER:--You were so anxious about my proposed

plan of spending the next few months that I thought a few words

announcing that the doctors have disapproved of that scheme

would be some relief to you. Dr. Dresbach introduced me to Dr.

Mussey and after having given him a history of the matter they

were of opinion that the trip at any other season would be a very

good one, but at present, by no means advisable. I shall have

another talk with Dr. Mussey (who wishes to starve me to death)

as to what course is best, but I have no doubt that the Mexican

stock is down, at least for the summer. It is possible that fur-

ther consultation will change matters, but, as I assured you before,

I shall not go unless it is for the best and it is pretty certainly

not advisable.  Dr. Mussey thinks a few months of outdoor loaf-

ing will restore me.

  I shall remain here at least a week longer. If you write, direct

to care of Pearl Street House.

                          Yours, in haste,

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.                               R. B. HAYES.

                                    COLUMBUS, July 1, 1847.

  DEAR UNCLE:--William leaves this side for me.  I have noth-

ing to say of especial interest. I am still taking Dr. Mussey's

medicines and they are certainly doing good. The throat is healed

a good deal; not bled any for almost a week. I shall go home

as soon as I can get away. I am to stay with Mother at Dela-

ware a few days. I want, I think, to go East with Pease, though

I shall make up my mind when I have had a talk with you and

him.

  I am very stupid and sleepy this evening, so good night. I

will write when you may expect me.

                           Yours,              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.





  Lower Sandusky [July] 1847.--I have been to Cincinnati,

taken the advice of Dr. Mussey, and given up my design of going

to Mexico. I disliked to leave the company of volunteers, but I

had promised my friends not to go if Dr. Mussey thought it

would injure rather than benefit my health. My excuse, made to

all friends, for going was ill health, and I could not avoid pledg-

ing myself to abandon my intention if medical advisers thought

unfavorably of it. I am advised to take certain remedies, and if

I travel to go north instead of south. I remained at Columbus

until July 6; came on to Delaware with Mother and Laura; at-

tended a Sons of Temperance celebration; visited Miss Lucy

Webb and left for here Friday, July 8, intending to go East in a

week or ten days with cousin John R. Pease.





                           LOWER SANDUSKY, July 19, 1847.

  MY DEAR SISTER:--Pease and myself will start tomorrow for

Brattleboro. Shall reach there by Saturday evening with good

luck. We have not yet fixed upon the route we shall take in our

cousining campaign, but we intend to make clean work of it,

making a short visit to all the kin. After finishing this part of

the fun, I shall leave Pease and go to Cambridge to be there

commencement day if possible, spend a short time on the coast,









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          209</B>



and then home by the way of New York City. If you write,

direct to Brattleboro, where I shall be likely to get your letters.

Pease, if he has time, will court some Yankee girl, but he is sure

not to have time. As for myself, it will depend on the appear-

ance of things when I get there. Mother and Mrs. Lamb selected

a clever little schoolgirl named Webb for me at Delaware and

it would not do to defeat their plan by seeking another sweet-

heart in New England.

  A week ago I was at Sandusky; had a fine visit with Will

Lane and Campbell. Lane has not changed much since he left

for Germany. He has now gone to work in good earnest, prac-

ticing law with his father.

  My health is so good now that I hope to be at work again as

soon as I return from the East. Yesterday (Sunday) Pease,

Uncle and myself were all out at Green Spring (Stem's) and

had a pleasant visit, spending the hottest day ever was under

the cool shade around the finest spring in the State.

  Uncle is full of the bank these days. It is uncertain whether

he will succeed, I suppose, but all are quite confident here.

  I shall write you occasionally while I am gone. Hope Mother

and Lolly had a pleasant visit.

            Good-bye.--Your affectionate brother.

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.





  [This trip began July 20. Hayes reached home September 26.

On his birthday, October 4, he wrote in his diary brief notes of

his itinerary and of his doings while away. Hayes and Pease

went down the river on a little steamboat to Sandusky. There

at 3 P. M. they boarded the Constitution which landed them at

Buffalo the next night at nine o'clock! Thursday morning they

took the train for the East and reached Troy about noon Friday!

Saturday morning they went by stage over the mountains, "dining

at Bennington and supping at Wilmington, and reached Brattle-

boro at 12 midnight." The whole journey now would be made

in twenty hours or less. The letters tell the story of the summer

with sufficient fullness and detail.]

               WEST BRATTLEBORO, VERMONT, July 29, 1847.

  MY DEAR MOTHER:--Pease and myself arrived here Saturday

evening after a most delightful trip of five days, including about

thirty-six hours' stoppages at Buffalo and Troy. We spent Sun-

day here, Monday with Sophia, where we found Janette and

Belinda with her husband; Tuesday at Uncle Austin's; yesterday

at Putney with the Noyeses, and today we shall spend in the

east village.  We found our friends everywhere in good health,

except a sick child of Belinda's. Charlotte and Mary were both

at home appearing very well; Uncle Austin is in finer health than

usual.

  I was agreeably disappointed at Putney. There are more sin-

cerity, charity, and refinement there than in any family ex-

clusively given up to religion that I have been in. George Noyes

was married a short time ago to one of the converts at Putney.

Mrs. Noyes (aunt) said that "reasons of state" (perfectionism)

were at the bottom of it; but when I saw his intelligent and

beautiful bride, I could easily believe that other "reasons" had

quite as much to do with the match.

  Returning from Putney, we called on Uncle Roger, found him

"the same old two and six," etc. Belinda's husband, Mr. Mc-

Lelland, is one of the best of the cousins. We shall visit him

at North Adams the last of this week. We shall leave tonight

for Chesterfield, Massachusetts. I shall return here again and

make longer visits at Uncle Austin's and elsewhere, but at pres-

ent I move to keep pace with Pease's wishes. Uncle Russell's

little girls are very pretty indeed.

  I receipted for Fanny's $17.50 left her by Grandmother and

will hand it over when I go home.

  I am told that Mr. Charles Converse, Trimble, and S. J. An-

drews, with a dozen more from Ohio, are at Dr. Wesselhoff's

establishment in the east village. John Mead enters college at

Cambridge this fall. He promises well.

  All send love and forty messages which I'll not remember.

Direct, if you write, to Brattleboro. Do not write anything not

for the eye of all the cousins.

                     Yours affectionately,

                                               R. B. HAYES.









             <B>VACATION IN NEW ENGLAND, 1847          211</B>



  I find your monstrous story of my sickness has gone every-

where. I deny its truth in toto. I shall be careful not to tell

such facts again.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



                      BRATTLEBORO, VERMONT, July 29, 1847.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We had a fine trip; reached here Saturday.

Uncle Russell lent us his horse and buggy; we went to Fayette-

ville, Putney, and Dummerston and returned yesterday evening.

Uncle Austin is in better health than usual; was astonished to

find me so well and appeared to enjoy our visit. Charlotte and

Mary were both at home. Mary had just returned from Boston

with as much beauty and as little intelligence as ever. Charlotte

appeared to good advantage by the side of her sister. The

screaming when we entered the house was quite equal to Mrs.

Valette's conjectures. It might have been heard a mile. Aunt

Birchard showed herself in quick time. We had not been in the

house five minutes before she began to exhibit Mary for Pease's

benefit--apparently wishing to have Mary captivate him! So

she forced her to play and him to listen to some half-dozen tunes

on the piano. Mary performed her part in a half-fretting, half-

willing manner, and Pease, to do him justice, suffered with the

patience of a martyr. The day was raw and cold. We found

Mary dressed in a very neat, becoming style, but her mother soon

had her rigged out as if for a ball, arms bare to the shoulder and

the rest in keeping. Strange to say, Pease's heart was untouched;

even the naked arms, chilled into goose flesh, didn't fetch him!

           We are going to North Adams.  I guess Pease will

find a sweetheart courted for him and possibly may marry.

  If you write, direct to Brattleboro. I will write again in a

fortnight.                   

                            Yours,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

                     NORWICH, CONNECTICUT, August 8, 1847.

  MY DEAR SISTER:--I wrote to Mother about ten days ago

from Brattleboro, but as you may be more anxious than usual









<B>212          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to hear from me now that I am travelling about at loose ends,

another letter may be acceptable. From Brattleboro Pease and

myself took the stage to Greenfield, the cars from there to North-

ampton, and thence in a buggy to Chesterfield. We happened

there at a lucky moment. Helen and her two children and Aunt

Fanny and her son, George, were all there, making with our-

selves a large circle of relatives. Harvest and haying, both bet-

ter than common, were first discussed. Uncle Bancroft and the

whole family were in high spirits and our visit was as happy a

one as any we had made.

  One of Uncle's boys--William, I think, the one intended for

a scholar, at any rate--had given up going to college, and after

some consultation it was agreed that he should spend the winter

in Lower Sandusky where Pease is to use him as a tinker, a ped-

lar, clerk, or whatever he pleases, and see what he is good for.

He looks like a tolerable sort of boy, but was as solemn as a

gravestone, owing in part doubtless to a stiff neck in consequence

of a cold caught in haying. But I doubt whether a stiff neck

could spread such a doleful expression over his features if it were

not habitual.

  They all spoke of you, their desire to see you; also of Mother,

and the pleasure they had in her visit last summer. Uncle Ban-

croft, with characteristic bluntness, speaking of Mother, said:

"She is grand company. She talks a perfect hailstorm, faster

and faster, and never was tired. Oh, it did me good to hear her!"

He is a curious old philosopher. I was amazingly pleased with

him. Somehow, with the exception of Uncle Austin, who is

first in my regard, our Yankee relatives by marriage are nearer

kin than our blood relatives. Witness Aunt Russell Hayes, Mr.

Mead, Mr. Bancroft, and Mr. McLelland (Belinda's hus-

band). I like them better than any of the rest. It shows, at

least, that our family are good judges of character in selecting

their partners.

  After visiting at Chesterfield we returned to Northampton and

took the cars for the south. I stopped at Springfield and Pease

went on to New York. Pease is to return about this time to

North Adams to see a girl his sisters had selected for a wife. He









             <B>VACATION IN NEW ENGLAND, 1847          213</B>



told me he would court her if her looks suited. I expect to find

a letter from him on the subject when I get back to Springfield,

and if anything of the kind is going on I shall immediately go

up to North Adams. There would be sport in watching a court-

ship of his. I had almost forgotten how unmercifully he man-

gles the king's English. At home, among men and intimate

friends, he is quite blunt and occasionally speaks a grammatical

sentence.  But among strangers--females--such strangely awk-

ward expressions as he "bulges" out would drive Lindley Murray

to despair. But I have no fears of his success if he undertakes

to court. He is really "sound corn" (Buckeye) and one with

half an eye cannot fail to see it.

  After parting with Pease, I stopped at Springfield several days

with my favorite Cambridge friend (Bond), seeing and enjoying

all there is in that part of Massachusetts. Springfield is a splen-

did town. It has all the spirit and improvement of a Western

city with the beauty of a New England village. Its population

has doubled in eight years. The whole town now contains near

twenty thousand people.

  From Springfield I went down to the Sound and spent the

balance of the week in fishing and sailing. I fished about four

hours on the rock where the Atlantic was wrecked last winter.

There is no lack of company and the expense, avoiding the great

places, is trifling.

  I only looked into Newport, saw the name "K. Thomas, Ohio,"

on the register, and joined a sailing party; was out in a storm;

caught myself blackfish, sea bass, porgies, dogfish, and flounders.

  I left my trunk, taking nothing but a carpetbag and umbrella,

and so wandered about as independent as a midshipman on half-

pay. Tomorrow there is a pleasure excursion going from here

to New Haven to return at night.  If Uncle William is there I

shall stop a few days, and if not, a longer stay than a few hours

would be a bore.

  I forgot to say that my health is perfectly good. I have not

thought about [it] before in a fortnight. The only part of Dr.

Mussey's prescription that I stick to is cold water and bathing.

  I presume Uncle will be with you when this reaches Columbus.









<B>214          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



If not, please let him know of my doings for I do not wish to

write to him today. There are no conveniences for writing.

                   Good-bye.  Love to all.

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  I shall not come home till the hot weather is over,

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.



             WEST BRATTLEBORO, VERMONT, August 30, 1847.

  MY  DEAR FANNY:--Day before yesterday I returned from

wandering to and fro through the land of the Pilgrims to the "old

eyrie" of our fathers and was rejoiced to find two letters from

Columbus (albeit they were somewhat old) [giving] the first

news I had received from home.

  First, to give you my purposes: Tomorrow I shall go up to

Fayetteville, stay about four days, return here and start for New

York next Monday, one week from today, and thence, after a

stop of a couple of days, home by the northern route. I may

change the route but do not expect to do so. On my way to New

York I shall perhaps stop a few days as I have not visited New

Haven yet. I certainly shall, if Uncle William arrives. He is

looked for daily. When arrived at home I shall go to work in

my office as usual. I think I can safely do it, but if I find it any-

wise hurtful I shall be ready in November to resume my travels

southward.

  I am sorry to hear that Uncle's case goes to Washington. This

is the only bit of news I have heard as to affairs at Lower San-

dusky. If you write me at New York, care of Dr. Hickock, I

shall probably get the letter.

  Since I wrote you from Norwich, Connecticut, I have travelled

in this wise: I went to North Adams, Massachusetts, (Belinda's

home) to see how Cousin John succeeded with his courting;

found him at Pittsfield with Janette just starting for Troy and

in great doubt whether he should return to North Adams, after

doing up his chores in Troy, and finish the work he had begun,

or wait till another year. I returned with Janette to Adams,

staid three of four days, paid my respects to the girl Pease had

commenced to court, and returned to my friend's at Springfield.









             <B>VACATION IN NEW ENGLAND, 1847          215</B>



Caroline Adams  (for so is hight Mrs. Pease that is to be) is a

girl about twenty or twenty-one years of age, quite tall, dignified,

and handsome. Not very bookish, but intelligent enough and

ladylike. All in all, a very reputable cousin. Though I fear

Cousin John will defer his opportunity till his flower is plucked

by some other hand. He seemed hardly to know whether he

"fancied" Caroline or not. I told him he did and he "thought he

ought to"!

  From   Springfield  with  two  friends--young lawyers--I

started for the White Mountains; reached there in good time;

ascended Mount Washington one beautiful day, and had a noble

view of the lakes and hills; visited all the noted  lions--the

"Notch," the "Basin," "Pool," "Flume,"  "Bridge," and "Old

Man of the Mountain." Without going off in a frenzy of admi-

ration, it is enough to say that the White Mountains are "some

pumpkins."

   [Hayes in his diary adds some interesting details of his Mount

Washington experience.    He  says:--"Saturday,  August  21,

passed through Littleton to Fabyan's Washington House.  Found

my friends, Norton and Knox, had gone on to the mountain.

Day clear and beautiful; concluded to go up and spend the night

for sunset and sunrise; companions, James Kelly, a young broker

of Wall Street, Britton of Richmond, Staten Island, and the

guide. Two blankets, two bottles of brandy, pork pie and bread,

and a bag of oats for our two nags, [and] an axe to cut fuel

completed our equipments. Reached the summit in time for a

grand view of sunset. Then cold rain and horrors during the

longest night I ever saw. A door for a bed, a stove-pipe for

a pillow, and no shelter to speak of. Horses frightened. Stone

wall blown down and the deuce to pay; but we lived through

it."]

  From Mount Washington [I] went to Boston; found Mr. Mead

there with John, who had just entered freshman at Harvard, and

friend Camp who had joined the Law School We were there

at Commencement; saw Will Niel's class graduate. Niel was

among the graduates but had left at the end of last term. George

P. Marsh, the famous Vermont scholar, delivered the Phi Beta









<B>216          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Kappa Oration--a great one too, the more interesting from his

connection to a pretty girl (?).  Camp and myself paid our de-

votions to the Puritan shrine at Plymouth; found it a pleasant

and interesting spot for pleasure and curiosity seekers. After

having renewed my acquaintance with the Boston lions, I came

back where I now is: "to wit," "viz," "that is to say," the old

homestead, northwest chamber, etc.

  I did not ascend Mount Holyoke though I amsure we should

either of us be as much delighted with it as in the days of our

"small experience."   I visited the highest mountain  in Massa-

chusetts, Greylock; the highest in Vermont, Ascutney; and

the highest in the United States, Mount Washington, and have no

doubt that a more beautiful pleasing scene is spread out before

the eyes on the summit of Holyoke than on either of the other

three.

  You should publish your "Song of the Cradle." It must be

quite equal to the preacher's parody, the "Song of the Quill."

  When a person is forced to comment on what is contained in

one of your letters, I believe you take it as evidence that he is

out of timber, so I'll make an end "on't" by saying that I have

nothing to add to my Norwich letter on either of the great sub-

jects which occupy the minds of the youngsters of this age--

war, politics, and love.

  Hope Mother's face is well again.--Love to all.

                Your affectionate brother,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                            NEW YORK, September 19, 1847.

  MY DEAR FANNY:--William  [Platt] is writing on the other

corner of the table and as there is room for another scribe on

this, I will have a talk with you about my visit to New Haven.

  Last Monday morning early, [I] trudged down to the boat for

New Haven in the rain; had just got my baggage stowed and

fare paid, when I came upon Mr. Ford and his lady, who, having

heard of Uncle William's arrival from the West Indies, had come

East to visit him. Mr. Ford was about as interesting as usual,

occasionally entertaining me with a "yes mom" or "no mom" in









             <B>VACATION IN NEW ENGLAND, 1847          217</B>



reply to inquiries of his wife, until our arrival at the wharf at

New Haven, when quite an exciting scene occurred between Mr.

Ford and some dozen or fifteen hack drivers who were all bent

on assisting Mr. Ford in the easiest and shortest manner to the

exact place he wished to reach. Mr. Ford was sadly puzzled what

to do. He could not bear to refuse anything to such polite and

hospitable persons, and at the same time he must of necessity

select one and disappoint the rest! How to do it without wound-

ing the feelings of any of his attentive friends was the problem.

The drivers, seeing his trouble, redoubled their importunity. One

seized a trunk, another a bandbox, a third his wife, and two

actually contended for the possession of Mr. Ford himself! But

our Governor (?) that is to be finally reached the Tontine in

safety but, like James  Fitzjames after "the combat,

breathless all."

  I found Uncle and Aunt in good health, together with their

little adopted child. I cannot repeat all the kind things they said

of you and Mother. You know Aunt E. has a large stock of

affectionate adjectives always ready to scramble out of her mouth

whenever it opens, and she seemed nothing loath to give them

utterance when speaking of you and Mother. Uncle William

too was quite prolific in the same sort of expletives. I took up

your portrait, as a substitute for your own sweet perfections,

and that came near converting the whole family to idolatry. They

seemed to have a suspicion that you were flattered, but I assured

them that the image fell far short of the original. Little Annie,

the adopted, is a graceful, affectionate child of Laura's age, and

is very dear to them.

  I was greatly pleased with the Trowbridge family. Even the

old gentleman is not at all times a savage and Mrs. Trowbridge

is an excellent woman and thinks Mother is a little more after

her own heart than anybody else she is acquainted with. The

three girls are all charming. I might, perhaps, fall in love with

the oldest, Caroline, or the little witch, Ellen. The middle aged

is a fine girl but red-headed. I was beau to Caroline at one of

the largest weddings they have had in New Haven in a long

while. It was much like a Columbus wedding.

  As for New Haven, it might, fifteen years ago when it got its









<B>218          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



name, have been the prettiest town in New England, but there

are now at least half a dozen much superior to it in beauty. The

elms are all that give beauty to New Haven. It is as level as

Columbus and has very few elegant buildings. It is now begin-

ning to be called an antiquated belle in the other fine towns in

the East, and it is certain it has had its reign.

  I called on Clara Baldwin, found her looking extremely well.

She does not grow old fast. How she missed having some fine

fellow for a husband, is one of the mysteries; but she appeared

quite as happy in her single blessedness as many women in mar-

ried misery.

  I remained at New Haven until Thursday evening, enjoying

my visit as well as any I have made. When I come East here-

after I'll not omit to visit those beautiful cousins. They are

not well educated in books, but have seen enough of people who

are, not to exhibt ignorance of such matters and they have more

unsophisticated simplicity of character than I have before seen

in persons who are at home in "the upper ten thousand."

  Uncle William returned with me to New York to see Brother

William and remained till yesterday evening.

  I do not yet know when I shall start for home, but think I

shall go before William does, say Wednesday next.

  Love to all.

                   Good-bye. Your brother,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                       LOWER SANDUSKY, September 27, 1847.

   MY DEAR MOTHER:--I arrived at home last evening, found

all of my friends here well and the town quite healthy. Mr.

Buckland left this morning for Mansfield before he had time to

tell me anything of the business of the office, so that after having

set the house to rights and arranged my own papers and books,

I am left without anything to do until his return. During this

leisure time I am a-going to write to all the friends who have any

claims on me so as to start fair with the world, as far as corre-

spondence goes, upon beginning business again.

   Although I did not write home very often while I was on my









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          219</B>



excursion, I believe you must have heard of all my visits. My

stay at Dr. Hickcok's in New York was quite as pleasant as any

part of the whole trip. I staid there until Wednesday morning

last. I came up the Hudson River by daylight for the first time.

I need not attempt to tell how much I was delighted with the

noble scenery. . . .

  I believe I have not written to you since I was at New Haven.

Mrs. Trowbridge seems really to have fallen in love with you.

She talked as if she had never found any one quite so much

after her own heart as you are. It might have been partly from

a habit of talking kindly which some folks have, but I think the

most if not all was sincere. . . .

  Uncle has just returned from a trip of about two weeks down

into the Wabash country in Indiana. He is in excellent health

and spirits.

  I have received a letter from Bryan urging me to visit Texas

this winter and Uncle thinks I would do well to go; but my health

is so good that I prefer to resume my profession. I am a-going

to continue in the office until after our fall terms of courts, and

then, if I feel like it, I will pack up and take a ramble into the

wilds of Texas.

  I have seen several letters from my friends who volunteered.

They are all pleased and very healthy, and say I better come

down yet on my own hook; that the climate and life is just the

thing for me, etc.  But that fever is now worn off and I hardly

regret not having gone.    I have certainly spent the summer as

pleasantly and, so far as everything except health is concerned,

with more improvement than I should have found in a soldier's

life.

    . . . William intended to leave New York in time to reach

home next Saturday evening, but there is so much irregularity

about the boats on the lake that he may not reach Columbus until

Monday evening next.

                    Love to all. Your affectionate son,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.









<B>220          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                         LOWER SANDUSKY, October 16, 1847.

  MY DEAR MOTHER:--It is Saturday night and we have been

quite thronged all day with people inquiring for, and giving, in-

formation about their business in court next week. I do not feel

fit to do anything else and so think myself in the right frame

of mind to write a letter.

  Uncle has been busy all the week attending to some dozen

hands and teams who are working out their road tax on Buck-

land Avenue--the street leading from town to Mr.  Valette's

and which passes by Uncle's favorite building spot [Spiegel

Grove]. He is very proud of his work, and threatened Pease

and myself with most direful punishment if we did not visit and

praise it as he thinks it deserves.

  Pease is doing a great business with his traffic and barter and

is constantly affirming that this is the greatest place for a smash-

ing business to be found west of the mountains. In the mean-

while, I am sorry to say, law business is diminishing or at least

at a standstill. But these flush times are swelling the bubble at

whose bursting we shall find employment for our "pickers and

stealers."

  I see Mr. Gilbert is again a defeated candidate and from some

occasional sallies in the papers I imagine he has made himself

appear more ridiculous than ever. I hope Willie Gilbert will not

be infected with his father's follies for he has too much good

stuff in him to be spoiled.

  I wish I had a wife to take charge of my correspondence with

friends and relatives. Women of education and sense can always

write good letters but men are generally unable to fish up enough

entertaining matters to fill half a sheet. By the by, I hope you

and Mother Lamb will see to it that Lucy Webb is properly in-

structed in this particular. I am not a-going to take a wife on

recommendation unless her sponsors will fulfil to the utmost what

they assume.  Don't forget now. . . . . .

  Buckland has come in feeling in the best of humor--the effect

of good news from one of the doubtful districts, which he thinks

settles it that Ohio is Whig for another year. This was not ex-

pected in this part of the State, though we had the good luck

to carry this town for the first time in ten years.









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          221</B>



  There was a great soiree at one of "the neighbors," evening

before last. I did not attend and am in some doubt whether to

go to any this winter. There are a-going to be (from present

indications) a good many such gatherings this winter, and as I

vote them a bore I thought it best to begin with a safe precedent.

I shall not, however, avoid merry meetings in toto. For instance,

there is to be an oyster supper tonight at which my stool will not

be empty.

  Our Episcopal church has shut up shop, so I have turned coat

and come out Presbyterian. I presume you will not feel any dis-

satisfied with the change.  .  .  . Love to all.

                     Your affectionate son,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



                        LOWER SANDUSKY, October 23, 1847.

  MY DEAR FANNY:--. . . It is Saturday afternoon--the

close of court week. Buckland started for Buffalo this morning,

leaving me alone. The office is swept clean of the leavings of

loafers and business.  I too am "fixed" for Sunday--shaved,

boots blacked (two pair), best duds on. Affairs have gone nicely

in court, and I find myself as tranquil and satisfied as a clam at

high tide.

  The only news I can tell is the arrival and installation as a sub

in Pease's tin-shop of our cousin, Edward Bancroft. He seems

to be a very sensible boy and will, I think, enjoy his new home

and employment.

  I spent a Sunday a fortnight ago at Stemtown with the girls

and Miss Gardiner of Columbus. This is the only act squinting

towards gallantry that I have been guilty of since my return home.

In fact, I have been too busy to think of such things. . . .

I remember my thoughts matrimonial-wise of a year since but have

no very fixed notions on the subject now. Mother in her letter

to Uncle says she thinks the choice she made at Delaware is not

just the one. Well, I am content to go on or stop as she prefers.

If Lucy is too young she must find me an older one. Youth,

however, is a defect that she is fast getting away from and may

perhaps be entirely rid of before I shall want her (?).









<B>222          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Besides attending to business I am doing very little at present.

While travelling, I often thought of the pleasure I should derive

from a superficial knowledge at least of geology. Anything be-

yond this my habits and pursuits place out of the question. I

have chosen a few books and have gone into it vigorously since

my  return home.     I find the study very interesting and the

little I shall acquire will be of some benefit by way of putting

something where nothing now is. I have never had an inclination

to study anything of the sort before, and I mean now [to] push

my way into the natural sciences far enough to be able at least

to comprehend others when conversing on such subjects. I am

also brushing up my smattering of French and German so as to

be ready to read with ease divers works which Will Lane brought

home from Europe and which I have promised to read this

winter.

  Uncle still talks of my going to Texas this winter, but as I

have got into the way of using his famous Watson horse horse-

back riding, I am in hopes to keep out of the reach of medicine

and medical advisers. Mother occasionally lets fly a paragraph

which looks as if she was still harping on that subject; but if

she will only not talk about it to every one I am likely to meet

when I visit you, she may write to me as much as she wishes

and I will read, mark, and inwardly digest it all. But if she does

not wish to banish me from Columbus, she must not talk in such

strains that the first question I shall hear will be, "Why, how

well you look; when did you recover?" etc.  It is pesky vexing

to be forced to tell people that you are well and have been well,

and then be told that so-and-so had said that so-and-so heard

your mother say that you were in feeble health--far gone with

consumption. I would much rather have some terrible disease

than to be suspected of it when I am well. . . .

  Tell Lolly I know she must have been disappointed not to have

her letter sent, but we know all about it now and we are just as

much obliged to her as if we had received it.

  Uncle and Pease both well.--Love to all.

                  Your affectionate brother,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1847          223</B>



                      LOWER SANDUSKY, November 5, 1847.

  MY  DEAR  FANNY:--I of course  smiled--I always  do--

when I read Mother's cogitations on the subject of health, place

of residence, and good wives, and was well pleased, too, to find

your opinion agreeing with mine on the last mentioned topic.

  The  "real name" of the author of "Mosses  from an  Old

Manse" is given, I think, in the book. It is Hawthorne. He

was educated at Harvard and though a great student studied no

profession, and having enough of this world's goods to live

without labor has spent his life in a philosophical lazy way

("learned leisure"), occasionally rewarded for his witty contri-

butions to the Democratic Review by  some of the crumbs at

the disposal of "the powers that be," of whose policy he is a

moderate supporter. He at present holds some post in the cus-

tom-house at Salem. When I was at Cambridge some years

ago, he was living in the old parsonage--"the Old Manse"--

at Concord.

  Uncle and Pease are both well. Pease has quite forgotten

his Yankee sweethearts--all of them--in the hurry and hubbub

of business. Our town never before was as busy as it has been

this fall, and Pease has reaped a full share of the golden har-

vest.

  We  have a new cousin here, Edward  Bancroft--a good-

looking, intelligent fellow, of fine humor and disposition, but

with singularly solemn features which lead those who are un-

acquainted with him to think him sour-tempered or melancholy.

He is making tin cups and doesn't care a fig what he does or

what becomes of him, if he can only raise money enough to

travel. That is his hobby.

  Our  Captain  Thompson has  resigned  and  returned  from

Mexico, satisfied that he is too old for campaigning. It is really

a treat to hear his yarns, but a still greater one to see the in-

terested, longing air with which our new cousin listens to them.

He wants to go to Columbus, Rio Janeiro, and Canton! and

doesn't much care which he visits first.

  We have two new jokes on Pease about his gambling. One

is, Captain Thompson was telling in his honest way marvellous

stories of the gambling done in camp among the officers. He









<B>224          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



said: "I never gambled any. I couldn't, but I used to think If

Pease was only here he would skin you!"  Uncle and I repeat

this with the embellishments often enough to keep it in remem-

brance.

  I have just read a notice of the death of Father Espy. He

will be a great loss to our church. I can't write a eulogy on the

good old man for the River Committee are in the office engaged

in a warm debate on sundry matters of interest to the fishermen

and navigators of our Sandusky waters. . . .

  River Committee is breaking up. Pease says it is time to be

going. I have written this by snatches "between the showers," or

rather the storms, of the committee's discussions.--Good-bye.

                           Your brother,                  RUD.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.



                    LOWER SANDUSKY, November 22, [1847].

  DEAR SISTER:--. . . Uncle has again taken up his quarters

for the winter at Mr. Valette's. Cynthia is teaching school. Pease

is planning a new building for his business (which has grown

very profitable) and intends to erect the first tolerably good

store and warehouse ever built in the place. I've been rather

busy of late (it is a fact) in the way of my profession, but a

couple of weeks will see that off my hands and then I shall keep

on as usual. . . .  I cannot say to a day when you may

expect me, but I shall not leave here before the fifteenth of next

month, and I shall, if no accidents prevent, be at Columbus be-

fore Christmas. . . .

  I ate (or helped eat) a fine oyster supper at Mr. Cutter's last

evening. The supper passed off with a natural gentility not

often exhibited by the female portion of the household, upon

whom, of course, the responsibility of such affairs always rests.

I am satisfied there is at least one lady housekeeper in town.

Mrs. Cutter cooked the oysters, set the table, and presided at it,

acting each part as if she were bred to it. There are an abun-

was another person in the room, but not one in a score who can

serve in that department and be a lady at the feast. . . .

  Our church (the Episcopal) goes off finely now, as the Pres-

byterian minister (who was a great knave) nearly broke down

his congregation. Even Austin Taylor bought a pew and goes

regularly to church. Both strange events considering what a

close-fisted heathen he is, a sort of relation too! The bishop

was here a few days ago and had a confirmation of fifteen, con-

secrated the church, etc., etc. Everything went off to the satis-

faction of the vestry who are the six finest men in town; but not

one of the six has or pretends to have any more religion than

Mr. Gilbert or William. But they are all honest (in the business

sense), liberal, and whole-hearted, and before they had families,

a few years ago, were the rowdies of the town. They have

built the church with the same spirit that they used to go into a

spree. Mrs. Eddy, who is a glorious [woman] and notices all

the funny things, says there was nothing out of the way in all

the performances of consecration, etc., except that part of the

quire sung a psalm and the other part a hymn of the same num-

ber and to the same tune, but they were all so frightened it was

undiscovered among the singers! I was at Maumee when the

bishop was here. We passed him in the Swamp as we came this

way. He made us a very gracious bow. Our Democracy were

well pleased with him. In the meanwhile, Judge Lane says that

in Washington City the office-holders, retainers, etc., "Lokies"

one and all,--are Episcopalians; and through the country gen-

erally it is the favorite church with the party leaders. He thinks

it must be from a desire to be genteel one day in seven, which

is as near piety as can be expected of a full-blown, unterrified

Loco-foco.

  Love to all. I often try to imagine to myself Laura and Willie

as they must be now.

                  Your affectionate brother,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                       LOWER SANDUSKY, January 28, 1848.

  DEAR FANNY:--Pure  selfishness--if anything so  foul can

be pure--prompts me to write you at this time. If I supposed

there was any probability of hearing from you until you hear

from me, I would see this dirty sheet in Tophet before I would

fill it with my scribblings. I did not give you or Mother the

promised letter on the first Lord's Day after my return home,

inasmuch as all anxiety on my account must have been removed

by the note to Uncle which I mailed the first leisure moment

after my arrival.

  We have had two very goodish sort of balls within a fort-

night--also a few deaths!  But except the mud there is noth-

ing else you would be particularly pleased to hear of.

  Pease utters a chapter of lamentations every noon when he

goes behind the bar, and is thereby naturally reminded of Uncle's

absence! At night after supper he slowly draws on his over-

coat, lights a candle to stick in his lantern, looks carefully out

into the street, draws back, and with the ejaculation, "What a

country for white folks!" begins to pull off his coat, blows out

his candle, and sits down to play chess with "Put" till mid-

night. At the ball, Pease soon got weary of dancing, hunted up

a pack of cards and played the balance of the evening! . . .

  We  (that is Buckland's family, Pease, and myself) begin

to look forward to the day when we shall all be "Governors"

Ford (vide the song about Governors Tod), Buckland by vir-

tue of his wife's relationship to Mrs. Ford, and Pease and

myself by virtue of Uncle William's "chumship" at college.

Verily, we are a great people, and Dick was right when he told

the loafers at Goose Tavern that "they were all good enough

for Governors." When the porters at New Haven were joking

about "the good-natured man," they didn't know they were

handling a Governor.

  I was glad I started home when I did. The roads were then

tolerably good and I had excellent company, Loco-focos tho' they

were. As to health and all that ar, which gives Mother so much

worriment  (give me credit), I can't say anything interesting.

I am perfectly well and hearty (good Saxon --vide Johnson.)

  Since I have been at home I have been busy reading the books









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1848          227</B>



I brought along from Riley's. You must tell Uncle not to buy

any books I bought. Mr. Riley will be able to tell him my list.

Headley's "Letters from Italy" are quite interesting, also Dar-

win's "Voyage of a Naturalist." "Half-Hours with the Best

Authors" has some good things in it--how could it be other-

wise ?--but  is on the whole a mere  catchpenny. . . .

Love to all.       Your affectionate brother,

                                                         R.

  P. S.--Tell Uncle to come home quickly or Pease and myself

will join the Odd Fellows to keep out of mischief. Very suicidal

weather--dangerous to be much alone.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                      LOWER SANDUSKY, February 12, 1848.

  DEAR FANNY:--Yours of last Sunday by some lucky acci-

dent wormed its way through the mails and reached here in the

same length of time that was occupied in the creation of this

"terraqueous globe." I find no difficulty in imagining and ap-

preciating Governor Ford's grotesque politeness and the music

of the spirits. But I can't conjure what friend N. could have

found to say that would have smacked of "Spiritualism." He is

really a matter-of-fact, "material" sort of person, and to try to

ape the opposite character is "not wise."

  We have been looking for Uncle every stage since our treas-

urer returned and reported that he was coming the first fine

weather, and we have had several days of really charming

weather for the season within a week.

  The Sunday that you wrote your letter, one of my old college

chums, Trowbridge of Michigan (you remember him by the

baby jumper), was here. In the afternoon we walked up to

Mr. Valette's and teaed. The weather was so bad that I thought

Uncle might perhaps have returned Saturday evening without

our hearing of it. We of course found no Uncle, but were

agreeably entertained by Mrs. Valette whom I had not seen

before since my visit to you.

  Pease is becoming quite disconsolate without Uncle's com-

pany. In his desperation he sometimes goes so far as to talk









<B>228          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



of sparking a certain buxom country damsel who resides about

twenty miles from here, and at other times he threatens to go

to Columbus after him.

  We are beginning to have our hands full of business, getting

ready for the approaching courts. By the by, I wish Uncle

would tell our member to send us word if there has been any

change in the law as to this circuit, and the times of holding

courts. We are still in the dark in this matter.

  Uncle will be pleased to hear that John L. Greene was elected

to the high judicial office of "squire" yesterday. There was

quite a spirited little contest, and the cause of good government

and pacific counsels triumphed gloriously by the overwhelming

majority of one vote!

  The political elements are beginning to simmer preparatory

to the great bubbling which we soon shall have. Buckland would

like to be a delegate to the National Convention or to have some

other Scott man sent from this district. He wants Uncle's in-

fluence to quiet the Tiffin folks, who can and will get the ap-

pointment unless coaxed off by some kind-hearted friend of

theirs. So that Pease is not the only one who will be glad to

see Uncle.  As for myself I am in funds again.  Fellows come

in every once in a while wanting to pay a little money to Uncle.

I tell them my receipt will answer as well! So, as I said before,

I am in funds. There now! If all that fails to bring Uncle

home, I give it up.

  Ed Bancroft sits near me reading Shakespeare. I notice his

hands are decidedly rusty, though he certainly doesn't soil them

with labor.  Speaking of "soiling"--that's why I spoke of it--

I am afraid he'll soil my Shakespeare--but 'twould be uncou-

sinly to tell him so, therefore I must e'en be silent. He reads

about half a play, gets weary and goes off, and comes back to

take up another. Thus he goes over the beginnings of plays but

never finds the ends of 'em.

               Yours sincerely and affectionately,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1848          229</B>



                         LOWER SANDUSKY, April 16, 1848.

  DEAR FANNY:--I was very glad to receive another of your

"ho bone" letters last Thursday evening. It found me still busy

pettifogging.  Since I wrote you I have had the pleasure of

contributing my mite towards sending one of our colored fellow

citizens to the manual labor institution a few rods west of

your abode, there to spend the remainder of his days in repent-

ance for the past and preparation for the future breaking stone

--not to mention other worthies who are now dieting on bread

and water at the public expense. These and other such like

benevolent acts occupy the most of my attention this beautiful

weather.

  I am enjoying as good health as could be expected--seeing

how recently I broke off using liquor! By the by, Uncle has

quit the use of tobacco--chewing forever, and smoking till he

is in good health. . . .   Love to all.

                              Your brother,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.



                          LOWER SANDUSKY, June 18, 1848.

  DEAR MOTHER:-- . . . .     Court has been in session the

last week and done much more business than usual. Mr. Buck-

land's absence made it a hasty-pudding time for me, but it's

safely over and I shall be as clear of trouble and work as the

laziest youngster could wish for the next month.

  I am sorry Minor is so afflicted. I would like to spend a few

hours with him to drive away the blues if they trouble him.

That is one thing I am good for.

  I see you have converted Fanny to your good opinion of

Lucy W. [Webb]--except the freckles, and she says they may

be washed out.  Never mind about faults only skin-deep.  I can

easily forgive such, not being at all fastidious in matters of that

sort. Uncle and Pease have made a choice for me here. There

are many points about their selection which would please you,

some that please me, and a very few that Fanny would like.

As I must suit you all, our Sandusky girl will hardly catch me

at present.









<B>230          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Uncle was delighted to find so many complimentary things

said of the Gardiners.  It is quite possible that we may induce

Pease to visit Columbus when I do, in which case there is to be

a match made for him with some of 'em. Pease's and Uncle's

better halves are well-looking full-size oil paintings.

  I can't come down until after Buckland gets home, say mid-

dle of July, and then I can stay all time and perhaps longer--

make visits in Delaware and all that, if my money holds out,

and I intend to start pockets full.

                    Your affectionate son,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.

                            LOWER SANDUSKY, July 9, 1848.

  DEAR FANNY: -My pen is so poor that it would only har-

row up Mother's feelings if I were to direct my letter to her, so

I write to you in reply to her.

  I am sorry to hear that the little ones are unwell so often.

Really it is a miracle that any of us escape the "ills that child-

hood's heir to." Perhaps it's a wise dispensation. We always

value the good things of earth according to the care and labor

we spend in getting them. If the little folks were no more

trouble than apple-trees we should perhaps love them less.

  During the last month I have dabbled a little in law, a little

in politics, and a little in temperance reform. Yet with all these

matters, I have had to fall back on Shakespeare and miscellane-

ous readings to get happily rid of these long days.

  Buckland will not reach here for a week or two yet, and then

we must prepare for the Supreme Court which will keep us

busy until after the first week in August. From that time until

October I am at your service, or that of my friends, for all

that I now can think. Stem (the lawyer) is urging me to

go with him up the Missouri to kill a buffalo, etc., etc. There

are several other plans suggested to get rid of dog-days, such

as a trip to the upper lakes or Niagara Falls. So I can occupy

my thoughts studying upon these plans until the time for doing

arrives and then act as "circumstances" require.  I want to

spend another fortnight in Cincinnati to satisfy myself whether









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1848          231</B>



an attorney of my years and calibre would be likely to get busi-

ness enough to pay office rent in that growing village.

  As the period I had fixed for my pilgrimage here is within

a year or two of its close, it is about time to determine what

community shall be next blessed with my presence. Besides,

that pretty brunette, Miss. Johnson, dwells somewhere down in

that quarter of the State (Piqua, I think), and I might at the

same time look after my interests there too, if she is not al-

ready captivated.   Since the late Revolution in France, "too

late" has become a phrase of warning often heard; perhaps so

in this instance. But "no odds." I'd like to live in Cincinnati

if I could get "a fair start," and that I mean to look after with

two eyes if I make a visit there this autumn.

  Pease has gone East; will be home in a fortnight unless he

also gets the marrying mania, which is quite unlikely. Uncle

busies himself with his farms, his flowers, and politics, the flow-

ers having by far the largest share of his time and care.

  Have you ever had daguerreotype likenesses of Lolly and

Willie taken? They certainly are old enough to sit now if they

ever will be.

  We shall have a telegraph office here in a week or two, so we

shall be within speaking distance of the great world hereafter.

--Love to all.

                   Your affectionate brother,    R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.



                      LOWER SANDUSKY, September 18, 1848.

  DEAR FANNY:--[Beginning of letter, six lines mutilated.]

The excitement about the railroad was at its height all along our

route. People were constantly stopping the stage to make in-

quiries as to the route selected. I was glad to hear at Mansfield

that the route through Delaware was adopted. This for the sake

of "auld lang syne."

  Reaching home, found all our friends well. Uncle had dropped

his flowers and was diligently employed road making--improv-

ing Buckland Avenue, as the road leading to Mr. Valette's is

called. He has really made a fine road, but with his singular









<B>232          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



pride in whatever interests him, he would think such moderate

praise almost an insult and imagines it the finest road which has

been built since the Appian Way.

  Uncle, Buckland, and quite a gang of our Whigs came home

about midnight last night from Norwalk where they heard Cor-

win make one of his fine speeches. As I had heard him once this

fall, it was voted nem. con., that I should stay at home and keep

house.

  Pease has gone to Massillon; will return in a few days and

start after his little wife about the 10th of October. Our gossips

are very busy selecting him a spouse. The purchase of the farm

settles the question of his intention to wife someone, and he

can't look twice at the same girl without satisfying somebody that

she is [The next nine lines are mutilated. They contain some

reference to the proposed trip to Texas, and they make it clear

that the picture spoken of was a daguerreotype (probably) of

his niece, Laura, and his nephew, Willie.]

  Their picture is greatly admired. It is at Mr. Valette's, and is

much prized by Uncle.

  I have nothing to say and plenty to do, so "ad-yea." Write

and give me "the items."--Love to all.

                       Your affectionate brother,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                         LOWER SANDUSKY, October 8, 1848.

  DEAR FANNY:--Uncle reached home  in fine spirits a week

ago and has been out in the Swamp kissing babies and all the

et cetera of county electioneering ever since. The Whigs had

done nothing in this county until last week, but since Monday we

have done nothing else but serve the country. All this stew and

pother doesn't change a hundred votes, but the interest and sport

attending that sort of work is pay enough for those whose gam-

bling propensity leads them into politics.

  Mother wrote me a little letter by Uncle in which [she] seems

fearful that my interests may suffer for want of proper attention

in your quarter. I know the importance which in legal matters

if often attatched to what is called "constant claim" and would









             <B>IN PRACTICE, LOWER SANDUSKY, 1848          233</B>



have no objection to putting in my oar either by pen or word of

mouth if I thought it necessary or that it would be successful.

If there is no call for haste, or if it is probable that I shall see

her in November at home, I would prefer [to] do up that sort

of business face to face.

  Pease will start after his little young wife day after tomor-

row. He came out today in his new boots. They pinched his

gouty bachelor feet cruelly, but he took it philosophically as

part of the penalty for entering the married state.  Sunday

though it is, I am so often interrupted by politicians running into

the office that I must give up writing you much of a letter. I

promised to send three dollars to William for Uncle but haven't

the change "past me" now.          Yours,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.

                        LOWER SANDUSKY, October 22, 1848.

  DEAR FANNY:--The elections and court have kept our office

in a stew for the last fortnight. I suppose Seabury [Ford] is

Governor at last, but what an experience of ups and downs the

poor man has had. How the creams and oysters will have to

suffer next winter to pay for his anxiety!

  I shall be stirring about the circuit for the next three weeks,

and it will be out of the question for me to visit you until we

start on our trip South.  This weather  is favorable  for such

enterprises, as that you speak of. Yesterday and today are of

the very best of Indian summer weather. However, I have not

much faith in influences of that nature. I shall be coming down

about a month hence and will probably stop a week or fortnight

with you.

  Uncle, who is all taken up with politics, feels proud of what

we have done and perfectly outraged with the shameful manner

in which the Franklin Whigs have allowed things to go. Sweet-

zer for  (?)  Congressman is however punishment enough,  I

should imagine, without reproaches from abroad.

  I have an invitation to some part of the wedding arrange-

ments of Dr. Case, whether to the wedding party or not  I

cannot tell. It was from Mrs. Dr. Jones. I paid Dr. Little a









<B>234          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



visit last week. He has a pleasant office for loafers and time

enough to devote to his friends. Both agreeable things for my

purposes ..... Write.

                             Your brother,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. W. A. PLATT.





  [There is no entry in the Diary after that of October 4, 1847,

for more than a year. Then we have the following undated

paragraphs briefly summarizing the activities of the long period

of silence.]

  From the 26th of September, 1847, in my office with R. P.

Buckland, hard at work making up for lost time until the last of

December. Spent the holidays at home, Columbus. New Year's,

1848, call with John G. Miller Jr. During this visit make the

acquaintance of Helen Key. Attend small gathering at Mr.

B---'s, for the first time play "Ship from Bordeaux."  Janu-

ary 1, 1848, Little Red Ridinghood gathering at Sullivan's, see

Miss M. J---and----. [On the] 8th of January, enjoy that

convention. Return [on the] 10th with Jack Dickinson, Jim

Steadman, and Henderson--jolly crew.

  Stay at home hard at the desk until August 1848. Go to

Columbus by way of Mansfield. With Mr. Blynn to hear Corwin

at Xenia; party at H---'s and home in the night.  [This was in]

September--day of Whig county Convention.

  Work like a trooper for "Old Zack" [General Zachary Taylor,

Whig candidate for President,] and enjoy the victory. Remain

at home until November 21. Off to Columbus and thence to

Texas.
