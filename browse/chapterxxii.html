   CAMP  Joe Webb, Near Fayetteville, West  Virginia, Sun-

day, July 12, 1863. -- We  are starting on an expedition

to Raleigh County and perhaps further. I do not fully approve

of the enterprise.  We are too weak to accomplish much; run

some risks; and I see no sufficient object to be accomplished.

  I wrote to Lucy yesterday. I shall not write to Mother or

Uncle until my return. It would only cause them anxiety and do

no good. Of course this book will be sent home in case of

accident, and they will here see that they were not forgotten.

Dear boys, darling Lucy, and all, good-bye! We are all in the

hands of Providence and need only be solicitous to do our duty

here and leave the future to the Great Disposer.

  [July 16, 1863].--We reached Raleigh Tuesday, 14th, about

12:30 P. M. Found the enemy strongly fortified at Piney River.

It was deemed unsafe to assault in front, and finding it would

take much time to turn the position, it was resolved to leave

without attempting to storm the works. During the night the

Rebels kindly relieved us by running away!  P. M. We started

for Fayette on the 15th.





                        FAYETTEVILLE, July 16, P. M., 1863.

  DEAREST:--We  reached here today; left Raleigh yesterday.

The Rebels were fortifying beyond Raleigh on Piney. They

were already annoying us a good deal from there. We reached

their works Tuesday, 14th. After feeling for their position we

withdrew for the night. In the morning they were gone. A

force is destroying their works and we are so far on our way

             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          419</B>



back. We may go on another expedition before returning to

Charleston, but not one involving much risk.

  Morgan is in Ohio. I wish we were there also. Possibly we

may be if he remains long. Very queer, these last struggles

of the Rebs. They are dying hard, but it seems like the con-

vulsive and desperate efforts of the dying. . . . Love to all.

                Affectionately, dear one, your

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.



                               FAYETTEVILLE, July 16, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER: --We have been into Dixie and are safe out

again into our own lines -- a very lively and pleasant raid.

  I see Morgan is raiding in Ohio. I hope he will be caught.

It will not surprise me if we are called home to look after him.

I regard this as one of the reckless efforts of a despairing and

lost cause. Certainly the Rebel prospects were never before so

dark, nor ours so cheering.

  I am very well. No time to say more.

                       Affectionately,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



                               FAYETTEVILLE, July 16, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We are on our return from beyond Raleigh.

Rebs we were after left their stronghold without a fight, and our

troops destroyed their works. Shall probably return to Charleston

soon. Morgan in Ohio! I wish we were there also. All things

look well. The escape of Lee does not disappoint me. To get

rid of him so easily is a success. We shall get him some day.

I enjoyed this last little campaign very much indeed.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

  [July 22, 1863]. -- [On the] 16th, at Fayette, heard that Mor-

gan was in Ohio at Piketon, leaving there for Gallipolis. Gen-

eral Scammon wisely and promptly determined to head him [off]

by sending me. (This was after a sharp controversy.) [The]

Seventeenth with [the] Twenty-third and Thirteenth took steam-

boats from Loup Creek for Gallipolis. [The] 18th at Gallipolis

heard Morgan had pushed by up the Ohio as if to cross at

Pomeroy.

  Sunday, 19th, [at] Pomeroy. Halted; found the militia wait-

ing in position for Morgan. About noon he came; the Twenty-

third went out to meet him; found him in force; sent for [the]

Thirteenth; formed lines of battle. Morgan ditto. Seeing we

were "regulars and not militia" (words of inspection of Rebels),

he hurried off, with some loss. We had one wounded, in his

hand--Clemens, Company B.

  [The] 20th, at daylight, found Morgan at Buffington Island.

He was here attacked by General Judah's cavalry and the gun-

boats. Not much fighting by Rebels, but great confusion, loss of

artillery, etc., etc.

  On to Hockingport; guarded the ferries over the Ohio at Lee's

Creek, Belleville, and Hocking.

  [The] 21st, back to Gallipolis. Morgan's army gone up. We

got over two hundred prisoners. Everybody got some. No fight

in them. The most successful and jolly little campaign we ever

had.

  [The] 22nd, Wednesday, home again in Camp White. [The]

Thirteenth left at Point Pleasant; [the] Fifth sent to Gauley

Bridge.



           STEAMBOAT VICTRESS, OHIO RIVER, July 22, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We have been after Morgan for a week.  The

Twenty-third was in all the fighting at Pomeroy and Buffington

and took two hundred and six prisoners. The Rebs couldn't fight

soldiers at all. We lost one man.  We had a most glorious time.

We go up the Kanawha again today.

                          Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                 R. B. HAYES.

                               CAMP WHITE, July 22, 1863.

  DEAREST:--Home  again after an absence of two weeks,

marching and hurrying all the time. The last week after Morgan

has been the liveliest and jolliest campaign we ever had. We

were at all the skirmishes and fighting after he reached Pomeroy.

It was nothing but fun--no serious fighting at all. I think not

over ten killed and forty wounded on our side in all of it. Un-

luckily McCook, father of Robert and the rest, was mortally

wounded. This hurt me but all the rest was mere frolic. Mor-

gan's men were only anxious to get away. There was no fight

in them when attacked by us. You will no doubt see great claims

on all sides as to the merits of his captors. The cavalry, gun-

boats, militia, and our infantry each claim the victory as their

peculiar property. The truth is, all were essential parties to the

success.  The cavalry who pursued him  so long deserve the

lion's share. The gunboats and militia did their part. We can

truly claim that Morgan would have crossed and escaped with

his men at Pomeroy if we had not headed him there and de-

feated his attempt. It is not yet certain whether Morgan him-

self will be caught. But it is of small importance. His force

which has so long been the terror of the border, and which has

kept employed all our cavalry in Kentucky is now gone. Our

victorious cavalry can now operate in the enemy's country.

  I thought of you often.  We were quartered on steamboats --

men were singing, bands playing. Our band was back and with

us, and such lively times as one rarely sees. Almost everybody

got quantities of trophies. I got nothing but a spur and two

volumes captured from the Twentieth Kentucky, Captain H. C.

Breman, and now recaptured by us. Morgan's raid will always

be remembered by our men as one of the happiest events of their

lives.

  Love to the dear boys and Grandmother. Joe is unwell and is

in a room in town.

                        Affectionately,

                                                         R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                               CAMP WHITE, July 24, [1863].

  DEAREST: -- The happiness of this week's operations is dashed

by the death of Captain Delany and the probable loss of a num-

ber of other good officers and men in our cavalry. Captains

Delany [and] Gilmore, the Thirty-fourth mounted infantry, and

Second Virginia Cavalry left Raleigh, on the day we returned

from there, to cut the Tennessee Railroad at or near Wytheville.

On the very day we (the infantry) were gaining bloodless (or

almost bloodless) victories over Morgan on the Ohio, our cavalry

were fighting a most desperate battle with superior numbers

three hundred miles off at Wytheville. Our men were victorious,

carried the town by storm, but they lost Colonel Toland, Thirty-

fourth killed, Colonel Powell, Second Virginia, mortally wounded,

Captain Delany, killed, his two lieutenants, mortally wounded

(you know them both), and four other lieutenants, wounded;

thirteen privates, killed, and fifty, wounded or prisoners. It was

a most creditable but painful affair.

  I am expecting my two companies, the survivors, back tomor-

row. Wytheville has been one of the most violent Rebel towns

from the first. They always talked of "no quarter," "the black

flag," etc. The citizens fired from their houses on the troops as

they rode in. Colonel Powell was shot in the back. The town

was burned to ashes. I will write you more about it when they

get in.

  We are cleaning camp and getting settled again. The old lady

moved into the cottage when we left; I occupy the tent Captain

and Mrs. Hood were in. Captain Zimmerman went today to

relieve Captain Hunter as commandant of post at Gallipolis.

  Uncle Scott and Uncle Moses will feel very hopeful in view

of this month's work. We have taken, as I reckon it, seventy

thousand prisoners this month besides killing or disabling per-

haps fifteen thousand to twenty-thousand more. A pretty big

army of Rebels disposed of.

  Morgan is not yet caught. He may get off, but his ruin is very

complete. -- Love to all.

                      Affectionately, your

  MRS. HAYES.                                              R.









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          423</B>



  Sunday, [July] 26. -- The cavalry of General Scammon's com-

mand left Raleigh on Wednesday,  15th, to cut the [Virginia and]

Tennessee Railroad. On the [18th] they reached Wytheville

and had a desperate and bloody encounter. The Rebels occupied

the houses firing from them on our men. Our loss is serious.

Colonel Toland, Thirty-fourth Ohio Mounted Infantry, killed.

Colonel Powell, Second Virginia Cavalry, wounded mortally.

Captain Delany, a brave and valuable officer of my brigade, killed.

He was wounded in the body as he rode into town; dismounted

and stood by his horse firing his revolver when he was shot

through the head and killed instantly. The ball came from a

house hitting the eagle ornament on the side of his hat. Two

of his lieutenants badly wounded. The Rebels used the houses as

fortifications. They were burned.

  Captain Delany was killed at Wytheville on the 18th.  It was

near the entrance to the town from the northwest. His horse

had been killed and he stood by her firing his revolver. He re-

loaded after firing all his shots. A ball from a second-story

window struck through the eagle ornament on his hat and ranging

down through his head came out at his lower jaw on the opposite

side. Colonel Toland was at the bottom of the ascent leading

up into town, urging the men to go in and fire the town, when he

was shot through the breast. It is thought the same citizen, a

man of wealth living in a brick house at that end of town, shot

both Colonel Toland and Captain Delany. He (the citizen) was

killed by a [man of the] Thirty-fourth. His house was burned.

One citizen, a large fleshy man, in specs, was killed.

  The Second Virginia Cavalry behaved shamefully. They

would not go in to the support of Captains Gilmore and Delany.

The Thirty-fourth did nobly. Major Huffman, Second Virginia,

said with a smile as Lieutenant-Colonel Franklin and the Thirty-

fourth passed in: "That's right Colonel, go in"! but [he] didn't

offer to go in himself.





               CAMP WHITE, WEST VIRGINIA, July 26, 1863.

  MRS. DELANY:--I have seen several officers and men who

were with your husband at Wytheville. His company led the









<B>424          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



attack on the town. Captain Delany's horse was killed under him

and some think he was slightly wounded soon after the attack

began. Captain Delany continued the attack, encouraging his

men by his example until he was killed instantly by a ball in his

head. His body was taken to a house outside of the town, and it

is a gratification to know that it was left in charge of Father

Heidekamp, a friend of your husband, who is in charge of a

parish at Wytheville.

  I will get together the property of your husband and send it to

you as soon as practicable.

  A flag of truce will be sent towards Wytheville when further

particulars will be known.

                          Sincerely,

                                        R. B. HAYES,

                      COLONEL COMMANDING FIRST BRIGADE.



                                CAMP WHITE, July 26, 1863.

  DEAREST:--I got yours of the 18th last night. Morgan's

embargo having been removed, we may now expect less delay

in our correspondence. . . .   Your description  of the

militia doings is amusing enough.  We saw the same things on

our route in Ohio, but they were really very useful in blocking

roads, carrying information, and the like.

  Dear little Joe, it will be a long, long time before you will even

know in how many ways he was dear to you. There will be a

loneliness in the house at Cincinnati greater than anywhere else.

It was fortunate for your present feelings that we lost him as

we did, instead of at home. The other boys are, I hope, enjoy-

ing themselves.

  We are likely, I think, to remain here some time. The great

successes of this month, if the Potomac Army meets with no

great reverse, will be likely, I think, to substantially end the

Rebellion during my original term of service. It is two years

ago yesterday since we left Camp Chase.--Good-bye, dearest.

Love to all.

                       Affectionately,

  MRS. HAYES.                                              R.









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          425</B>



                                CAMP WHITE, July 28, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . We are again in our old camp.  We

have lost some valuable officers and men since we left. Captain

Delany, commanding one of my cavalry companies, was killed

in storming Wytheville. He was a man to trust. He received

his promotion on my recommendation and was one of my best

friends.

  We hear Morgan is himself taken at last. This is important.

At least ten thousand of our mounted men have heretofore been

kept busy watching him. They will now be at liberty to push

against the weakened enemy.

  It now seems probable enough that the war will be substan-

tially ended with our original enlistment.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  August 1, [1863].--Our best scout, Corporal Jacobs, and

Private Fenchard, Company F, were murdered last night at

Morris' mill on Gauley River, twelve miles above Gauley Bridge.

Jacobs was an awkward, pigeon-toed youngster, cool, shrewd,

brave; could walk fifty miles a day, go without food or sleep

longer than most men; very fond of scouting. Poor fellow! I

have long feared that he would be caught in this way. He was

made one of the color-guard but was so awkward -- never could

keep step -- that we usually let him be excused from all ordinary

duty. Ordered Morris arrested, to be kept if no proof against

him; hung if guilty of the murder in any way.





                              CAMP WHITE, August 5, 1863.

  DEAREST:--Yours from Elmwood, dated 2nd, reached me

this morning. You were not in as good heart as it found me.

I am feeling uncommonly hopeful. The deaths of officers and

men to whom I am attached give me pain, but they occur in

the course of duty and honorably, and in the prosecution of a war









<B>426          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



which now seems almost certain to secure its object. If at any

time since we were in this great struggle there was cause for

thanksgiving in the current course of things, surely that time

is now.

  Our prisoners left at Wytheville were well treated, and a

chaplain has been allowed to go there to see if the bodies of

Colonel Toland and Captain Delany can be removed.

  I am grieved to hear that Uncle Scott is in trouble about Ed.

If he recovers from his present sickness it is likely he will be able

to stand it better hereafter. The process of acclimating must

have been run through with him by this time. If he gets good

health he will soon recover from the trouble about the promotion.

Let him make himself a neat, prompt, good soldier and there

need be no worry about promotions. It was not lucky to put

so many cousins in one company.  I could have managed that

better, but as it's done they ought to be very patient with each

other. Ike Nelson was placed in a delicate position, and while

he perhaps made a mistake, it was an error, if error at all, on

the right side. Too much kinship in such matters does not do,

as Governor Dennison found out a year or two ago.

  I am glad you are going to Columbus. I had a chance to send

one hundred and eighty dollars by Colonel Comly to Platt where

you can get it as you want.

  By the by, who has the money left at Cincinnati? I sent an

order to Stephenson and he had none.

  Poor boys, they will get to have too many homes. I fear they

will find their own the least agreeable. Very glad Birch is get-

ting to ride.  Webb will push his way in such accomplishments,

but Birch must be encouraged and helped. Rud will probably

take care of himself.

  Yes, darling, I love you as much as you can me. We shall

be together again.  Time is passing swiftly. . . .

  Joe was never so jolly as this summer. He is more of a

treasure than ever before.--Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

                                                          MRS. HAYES.

  CAMP WHITE, CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA, August 6, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I received yours of the first yesterday morn-

ing. Lucy writes that she expects to go to Delaware and Colum-

bus about the middle of this month, and to visit you before her

return. I begin to feel about those visits to you a good deal as

mother does--that the care and trouble  they make for you

more than overbalances your pleasure in them; but you ought to

know best.

  The money that I supposed was in Stephenson's hands, is

somewhere, and I'll inquire until I find it and let you know.

  I think it probable that we shall remain in West Virginia. The

enemy has become alarmed by our movements against the Ten-

nessee Railroad, and has been strengthening their posts in front

of us until now we have twice our numbers watching us. To

keep them out of mischief, it is more likely that our force will

be increased rather than diminished. A gunboat has come up to

help us within the last half-hour. Our Wytheville raid did the

Rebels more harm than was reported. Five thousand suits of

clothing, over four thousand new arms, and quantities of sup-

plies were burned. I think they will not attempt to drive us

out in their present scarcity of men and means.

  The Kentucky election pleases me. I hope Ohio will do as

well.

                          Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                   R. B. HAYES.



                CAMP WHITE, CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA,

                                 August 9 (Sunday), 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER: -- It is a quiet, pleasant Sunday morning. A

large number of the officers and men have gone over to town

to church, leaving a few of us here "to keep house."

  Our Rebel friends are gathering in pretty strong force in our

front. Many think it is with the intention of driving us out as

soon as the roasting-ears are in condition to afford them food. I

think, however, that they are merely concentrating to prevent

us from making raids to destroy their important railroad to the

Southwest. Whatever they mean, it is a comfort to know









<B>428          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



that we are giving occupation to a larger force of Rebels that

they can well spare at this time.

  Uncle writes that he expects to meet Lucy at Delaware or

Columbus, and as she intends to visit you soon, I suppose you

will see them all in a few days or weeks. I would be glad to be

with you, but I am not expecting to be my own master before

another year. -- Love to all.

                   Affectionately, your son,

                                              RUTHERFORD.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



      CAMP WHITE, August 15 (Saturday afternoon), 1863.

  DEAREST:--Hottest day yet. All busy trying to keep cool.

A dead failure all such attempts. A year ago today we set out

for Maryland and east Virginia. A swift year.

  You don't write often these days. You don't love me so much

as you did. Is that it? Not much! You are as loving as ever,

I know, only it is a bore to write. I know that. So it's all right

and I am as fond of you as I was when you were only my sweet-

heart. Yes, more too. Well, write when you can comfortably.

  I am going to inspect the Thirteenth at Coal's Mouth tomor-

row; take the band along for the fun of it.

  I ride about, read novels, newspapers, and military books, and

sleep a power. We shall go up to Lewisburg, I guess, in two

or three weeks to see after the Rebels in that quarter. All quiet

in our borders now. . . . Love to all.

                  Yours, with great warmth,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.



                            CAMP WHITE, August 17, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . .  It looks as if we  should be very

quiet here for two or three weeks, after which it is probable we

shall push up into the mountains again for a campaign of three

or four weeks.

                          Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                  R. B. HAYES.









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          429</B>



  August 19. -- Mrs. Comly returned with her husband a few

days ago. I wish Lucy was here also. Foolish business to send

away our wives as was done. A very queer man when he gets

into a state of mind on any subject!

  The hottest of weather for the past three weeks or so. Mother

made a visit to Fremont with Laura and Colonel Mitchell.





                             CAMP WHITE, August 23, 1863.

  DEAREST: -- Very glad to get your good letter from Columbus.

I wish I could travel with you a few weeks now. Everybody

praises our nephew and his wife. That last phrase means Laura.

  You must tell me more particulars about Fanny and Minnie,

or do they call her Emily now? If she is growing into a young

lady as fast as I suppose she is, Emily is the best name.

  I got a letter from Mother at the same time with yours. She

is very contented and happy at Fremont. You will be together

soon. I hope you will manage to have the boys like her. She

is not likely to have much time to enjoy with her grandsons, and

I hope the most will be made of it.

  I see that our beautiful little lost one is in your thoughts a

great deal -- much more perhaps than you thought he would be

when you left here. If it does not sadden your life, as I think

it does not, I am not sorry that you remember him so often. He

was too lovely to be forgotten. Your moralizing on your want

of dignity and all that doesn't disturb me. You'll do for your

husband, and I love you so much, darling. Be cheerful and

happy. Do as well as you can by the boys, but don't worry

about them. They will come out sometime. -- Love to all.

                    Affectionately yours,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.



                             CAMP WHITE, August 24, 1863.

  DEAREST:--I write you again so soon to speak of a man we

lost on Saturday. Joseph Kramer was drowned while sailing on

the river. The sailboat (that pretty one of Captain Warren's)









<B>430          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



was swamped by a severe gale and poor Kramer sank after

swimming several rods. You will remember him as a good-

natured sailor who rowed boat with Archie at Camp Reynolds.

He got a furlough to see his family near Columbus. He was a

good soldier; leaves a wife and three or four children. They

live near Georgesville on the farm of the Harpers, a few miles

southwest of Columbus. Lieutenant Abbott was nearly lost with

him. He sank near shore and was senseless for a time.

  Kramer is buried on the beautiful hill above the White

monument. He was so good a man that I hope his family will

not be forgotten by those who are interesting themselves at

Columbus in the welfare of soldiers' families. His widow will

need the aid of a lawyer or claim agent to get her allowances

from [the] Government. Platt can perhaps name the right per-

son and otherwise assist her.--No news.-- Love to all.

                       Affectionately,

                                                        R.

                            CAMP WHITE, August 25, 1863.

  DEAR  UNCLE:--. . . I  keep  my  cavalry  moving  as

much as possible. The infantry has little to do. The prisoners

taken and deserters coming in all talk in a way that indicates

great despondency in Dixie.  If the movements of Rosecrans on

Chattanooga, Burnside towards Cumberland Gap, and Gilmore

at Charleston are reasonably successful, the Rebellion will be

nearer its end by the middle of October than I have anticipated.

A great contrast between the situation now and a year ago, when

Lee was beating Pope out of the Valley and threatening Wash-

ington. Beat the peace men in your elections and the restora-

tion of the Union is sure to come in good time.

      . . . There will be no need of your going to Delaware

or Columbus merely to get Lucy. If she goes to Fremont she

will be able to travel without other escort than the boys.--Love

to Mother. I enjoy her letters.

                          Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                 R. B.  HAYES.

                            CAMP WHITE, August 30, 1863.

  DEAREST:--. . .  These cold nights and autumn  storms

remind us of winter quarters. If we remain in this region I

mean to have you with me if possible all winter, and I feel like

beginning winter in good season. Already men are putting

chimneys in their tents. A few weeks will probably settle the

question as to where we shall spend the cold weather, and I

shall send for you at the earliest possible moment.

  My little sorrel in a savage fit bit Carrington very severely

yesterday. In one snap he cut ten large gashes, several of them

to the bone, in the muscular part of the right arm between the

shoulder and elbow. The bone is not broken, but he will be

disabled for a month.  He shook him as a rat is shaken by a

terrier dog. Charley Smith and two others were looking on, and

jumped in, or it is possible he would have been killed. As soon

as he was taken out of his stall the sorrel was as good-natured

as usual.

  I see it stated that very few are to be drafted in Ohio on this

call. I am glad if it is really not necessary, although it would

be pleasant to see our ranks full again. If we are not filled up

we shall of course be mustered out of service at the end of our

three years.--My love to all. Good-bye.

                  Affectionately, ever your

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.



                           CAMP WHITE, September 4, 1863.

  DEAREST:--Yours mailed 31st came last night. McKinley

(the former sergeant), tearfully and emotionally drunk, has been

boring me for the last half-hour with his blarney. He uttered

a great many prayers for "madame and those little boys, God

bless them." So, of course, I was civil to him.

  We are less and less likely to be moved from here as the fall

weather sets in. The change to cold weather was a most grate-

ful one in our hot camp. It takes the long cold rain-storms of

November to make our camps put on their most cheerless aspect.









<B>432          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  You inquire about Mrs. Comly and how we like her. She is

an excellent sweet young woman, and all who get acquainted

with her like her. She is affable and approachable, but of course

she can't make friends as you do. Your gifts are rare enough in

that line. The colonel is not well. He is living too luxuriously!

  I would be glad enough to see you enjoying a faith as settled

and satisfactory as that of Mrs. Davis, but really I think you are

as cheerful and happy as she is, and that is what is to be sought,

a cheerful and happy disposition.

  Tell the boys that Dick and Guinea are still fast friends. They

travelled with us up into Dixie as far as Raleigh, and down into

Ohio after Morgan. Dick has a battle with each new rooster

which is brought to headquarters, and with the aid of Guinea,

and perhaps a little from Frank or Billy, manages to remain

"cock of the walk." . . .

  Love to all--girls and boys. Tell Fanny [Platt] if she ever

gets time in her Yankee school to write to outsiders, I wish her

to remember me.

                     Affectionately ever,

                                                         R.

  September 5, 1863.  8 P. M.--Lieutenant Abbott, Sergeant

Clark, Sergeant Stoner, and seventeen other Twenty-third men

go into Dixie to destroy iron-works, bridges, etc., etc.  A

perilous task. Great hardships and exposures to be encountered.

Good luck to them!

  EDITOR CATHOLIC TELEGRAPH:--In the Catholic Telegraph

of August 26, I am mentioned as the commander of the expedi-

tion to Wytheville in which Captain Delany lost his life. This is

an error. The expedition was planned by General Scammon









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          433</B>



and was under the command of Colonel Toland until he was

killed early in the action at Wytheville, when (Colonel Powell,

the next officer in rank, having been disabled by a severe wound)

the command devolved upon Lieutenant-Colonel Franklin of the

Thirty-fourth Regiment, O. V.  This daring enterprise was so

ably conducted, not only in the advance and attack, but also in

the retreat, that it is due both to the living and the dead that

this correction should be made. Captain Delany was in the

brigade under my command until temporarily detached for this

dangerous service. Upon hearing of his death I sent the melan-

choly intelligence of the loss of this most gallant and meritorious

officer to his friends in Cincinnati. It was no doubt in conse-

quence of this that the mistake of the Telegraph as to the leader-

ship of the Wytheville expedition occurred.

                        Respectfully,

                                     R. B. HAYES,

                           CAMP WHITE, September 6, 1863.

  DEAREST: -- How will it suit you to come out here as soon as

you have visited Fremont, say in two or three weeks? I would

like to have you here before the weather gets too bad. You can

leave the boys with their grandmother somewhere and after

it is known where we are to winter, I can send for Grandmother

and the boys to come also. If we stay here, I will want to keep

house for "you all" this winter. If we go too far into the bowels

of the land for you to follow, you can return to Grandma and

the boys after a suitable visit here.

  As things are now it would be very agreeable for you here.

I prefer not to have the boys come out until it is quite certain

they can stay. If you only staid a week or two, it would be

worth while to come. If any change occurs to make it not

desirable for you to come, I will write you. In the meantime

I hope you will be able to cut your visits short so as to get here

by the last week in this month, or sooner if convenient.

  I send you enclosed a letter from Mrs. Delany as one of the

memorials to be kept with slips from the Catholic Telegraph.

<B>434          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I shall direct this to Columbus hoping however you have

started for Fremont. -- Love to all.

                      Affectionately, your



  MRS. HAYES,

       Columbus, Ohio.



                           CAMP WHITE, September 11, 1863.

  DEAREST:--Glad to get letters both from you and Mother

last night. Bless the boys, how they must enjoy their first family

visit to their new home! I would be as happy as any of them

to be there.

  We hear good news from Burnside in Tennessee. If true it

makes it more desirable that you should come here soon. If he

moves along the railroad into southwestern Virginia, we are

likely to push forward to cooperate, in which case we shall

probably get too far into Dixie for our families to winter with

us. I will notify you if anything occurs to make it imprudent

for you to be here a couple of weeks hence. This is the month

in which the Rebels can come into the valley with the least dif-

ficulty on the score of supplies, but I don't think they will come.

If there is a probability of it, I will telegraph Uncle Scott in time

to stop your coming, or have Captain Zimmerman stop you at

Gallipolis. I do not decide against the boys coming, but as you

will be compelled to come to Gallipolis by railroad and stage

(steamers don't run on the Ohio now) and will perhaps only

remain a fortnight or so, it will perhaps be as well not to bring

them. If after you reach here it turns out that we shall winter

in the valley, I shall send for Mother Webb and all the boys and

keep house, or you can go back after them.  In that case you

can rent the house, or if you prefer to winter at Fremont or in

Chillicothe, in case you can't do so here, you may rent the house

at once.

  My reason for wanting you to come here as soon as you are

through visiting at Fremont, is, that perhaps we shall be ordered

forward as soon as east Tennessee is firmly in our possession.









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          435</B>



I think, however, the chances are in favor of our wintering on

the Kanawha.

   Get me a lot of silk handkerchiefs and about three or four

pair stockings, not very heavy, but so-so. You can get them at

Fremont and do it before you forget.

  Mrs. Comly is greatly pleased with the prospect of your com-

ing so soon. Mrs. Ellen is expected soon. She is supposed to

be on some sandbar between here and Cincinnati on the Ohio,

praying for a rise of water. Mrs. Barrett is the only other

 officer's wife now here and she talks of going home in a fort-

night.

   Let me know by telegraph when you will be at Gallipolis

and the doctor or some one will come there after you.

   Since writing we have further news of gratifying successes

in east Tennessee. If all continues to go well there, it increases

the chances of a forward movement here, and furnishes addi-

tional reason for you to come on soon before it is too late.--

Love to all.

                       Affectionately,

                                                        R.

   P. S. -- You may get me a good pair of gloves -- citizens', not

 gauntlets -- warm.

   MRS. HAYES,

      Fremont, Ohio.





   September 13.--Sunday a year ago was the 14th.  South

Mountain and its losses and glories. How the sadness for the

former fades and the satisfaction with the latter grows!

   General Burnside has east Tennessee. Knoxville ours; Cum-

berland Gap taken, and our forces on the railroad nearly to

Bristol. Knoxville to Bristol one hundred and thirty miles;

Bristol to depot at bridge one hundred and seven; total two hun-

dred and thirty-seven.   Charleston to bridge one hundred and

sixty-six.









<B>436          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  September 20. -- Abbott and party returned. Found the moun-

tains filled with deserters and refugees, the roads and paths

patrolled by Rebel soldiers in pursuit of them. Food scarce;

returned in consequence of difficulty of getting food and the

great number patrolling all routes. Many very desperate gangs

of Union men in the mountains.

  September 21, P. M. -- "Rosecrans [at Chickamauga] has

been badly beaten"! Such is the shock the dispatch gives us this

evening. After months of success one of our great armies is de-

feated. A concentration of Rebel armies has overwhelmed our

noble Army of the Cumberland. How these blows strike my

heart!  I had just read a joyous dispatch from "L. W. H.",

"Billy Rogers has a baby." But nerve ourselves, we must. We

shall recover from the blow.

  I have thought over it and feel easier. I suffer from these

blows more than I did from the loss of my sweet little boy. But

I suffer less now than I did from Bull Run, or even Fredericks-

burg.  Can Rosecrans hold Chattanooga?  Has he lost his army?

Will he be driven across the Tennessee? He ought to have

stopped his campaign with the capture of Chattanooga, fortified

the place, and awaited events. Easy to say so now, but im-

possible before, I suppose. Jim McKell, Lieutenant Nelson,

Colonel Mitchell (Laura's husband), all with Resecrans. Anx-

ious hearts at home.

  September 23.--News better. Rosecrans defeated but not

badly. Enemy probably suffered too much to take advantage

of their victory.





                          GALLIPOLIS, September 24, [1863].

  DEAR UNCLE:--Lucy arrived here safely last night.  We

shall go up the Kanawha tomorrow.

  I hope that Rosecrans will be able to hold Chattanooga after

all. If he does, this struggle will be a most serious disaster to

the Confederacy, even if they have gained the battle, as a mere

military result.

  I hope Birchie will not give you trouble. It gratifies me to









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          437</B>



hear that he can chop so well, and that he is learning the names

of the trees.

                          Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



        CAMP WHITE, WEST VIRGINIA, September 28, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER:--. . .  Your letter from Delaware dated

the 20th came this morning.  I am glad you are safely back to

Mrs. Wasson's pleasant home.  I always feel uneasy when you

have a journey before you.

  Lucy left Webb and Ruddy with their Grandmother Webb at

Mrs. Boggs'. Birch went with Uncle back to Fremont.

  I am in no hurry about having my boys learn to write. I

would much prefer they would lay up a stock of health by

knocking around in the country than to hear that they were the

best scholars of their age in Ohio.

  I am glad to see that Laura's husband has distinguished him-

self in the recent great battle and has escaped without injury.

His good fortune will be gratifying intelligence at Columbus.

  Lucy is in camp with me. Mrs. Comly (late Libby Smith) and

Dr. Barrett's wife are also in camp and make a pleasant little

circle. She sends love.--Remember me to Sophia and Mrs.

Wasson.

                   Affectionately, your son,

                                                        R.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.





  September 30, [1863].--Today I explained to the Twenty-

third Order Number 191 respecting the re-enlistment of veteran

volunteers. I told them I would not urge them to re-enlist; that

my opinion was that the war would end soon after the inaugura-

tion of a new President or of Lincoln for a second term, say

within one year after the expiration of their present term, i. e.,

June 1865, unless foreign nations intervened, in which case they

would all expect to fight again. About sixty re-enlisted.









<B>438          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



          CAMP WHITE, WEST VIRGINIA, October 2, 1863.

  MY DEAR SON:--I received a letter today from Uncle Birch-

ard. He says you appear to be very happy learning to chop and

work, and that you are helping Allen. Your mother tells me,

too, that you have learned the names of a good many trees, and

that you know them when you see them. I am very glad to

hear so much good of you. It is an excellent thing to know

how to work -- to ride and drive and how to feed and hitch up

a team. I expect you will know more about trees than I do. I

did not learn about them when I was a little boy and so do not

now know much about such things.  There are a great many

things that are learned very easily when we are young, but

which it is hard to learn after we are grown. I want you to

learn as many of such things now as you can, and when you are

a man you will be able to enjoy and use your knowledge in many

ways.

  Your mother took a ride on Lieutenant McKinley's horse this

morning, and enjoyed herself very much.

  Uncle Joe has a big owl, such a one as Lucy saw at Uncle

Birchard's. A corporal in Company E shot its wing off, so it

couldn't escape. It snaps its beak very fiercely when we poke

sticks at it. The band boys have a 'possum and there is a pet

bear and deer.

  I think Uncle Birchard will find a way to stop his chimney

from smoking.  If he doesn't, you must tell him to build camp-

fires in front of his house as we do here. We find them very

pleasant.

  I am sure you will be a good boy and I hope you will be

very happy.

                  Your affectionate father,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  BIRCHARD A. HAYES,

      Fremont, Ohio.





  October 7. -- A rain a few days ago gave us a rise of two or

three feet in the Kanawha River. It is falling again, but is rain-

ing today again with prospects of water.









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          439</B>



  Another order to give no passes and take up all old ones.

Funny business, this pass business. "Finds something still for

idle hands to do."





                              CAMP WHITE, October 7, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I am very glad to hear that you are having

so little trouble with Birchie. He is of an affectionate disposition,

conscientious and truthful. His natural sense of duty is, I think,

unusually  strong. . . . I  much  prefer  that  he  should

work or ride or hunt in the open air than read in the house or

go to school. I do not care if he is far behind other boys of his

age in what is taught in schools. If he has health enough to

become a scholar or prepare himself for a learned profession at

sixteen, he will have enough time to do it then. If he hasn't a

constitution that will bear a sedentary life, there is more reason

for trying to build it up now by work and exercise in the open air.

  Lucy is well and enjoys our camp life as well as she could be

expected to do away from her boys.  In about a week from now

I shall probably be able to settle the question as to our winter

quarters and as to whether it will be worth while to send for the

boys. It looks as if the coming winter would be one of active

operations, and if so any plan I may form is likely to be inter-

rupted before spring. Indeed, is liable to be interrupted at any

time. In any event, I think we shall stay here watching the gaps

in front of us for six or eight weeks longer. After that I think

a somewhat smaller force will suffice to defend this region, and

we may be sent elsewhere. I think there is no danger of our

being seriously disturbed here. . . .

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



                            CAMP WHITE, October 10, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I have just received your good long letter

from Delaware on [of] the 3d. . . . There was no time

for Lucy to stop at Delaware on her way here. We were likely









<B>440          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to be sent South immediately after the battle in Georgia, and I

telegraphed her to come at once if she wished to see me. Our

going was not ordered as expected, and now we are more likely

to go to Ohio to recruit this winter than South. The Twenty-

third was the first original three-year regiment and its time will

be out in a few months. The men are re-enlisting for another

three years and there is a fair prospect of continuing the regi-

ment if we can get a little while at home this winter.

  In the present uncertainty as to our winter campaign, I can

make no arrangements for my family. In the meantime Lucy is

enjoying a visit here. We have a number of agreeable ladies

in camp, and are making pleasant acquaintances among the citi-

zens. Charleston was a fine town before the war, and had a

very cultivated society. The war broke it up, but now the town

is gaining again and will ultimately recover its former prosperity.

Give my love to friends.

                        Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.





  October 15, [1863]. -- No rise of water on account of the rain

of the 7th.--A fine time, election day (13th). The Twenty-third

--five hundred and fourteen -- unanimous for Brough.  I went

to bed like a Christian at 9 P. M. McKinley waked me at eleven

with the first news -- all good and conclusive. My brigade

unanimous for Brough; Twelfth Regiment, ditto. A few traitors

in [the] Thirty-fourth. McMullen's Battery, one for Vallandig-

ham. State forty or fifty thousand on home vote. A victory

equal to a triumph of arms in an important battle. It shows

persistent determination, willingness to pay taxes, to wait, to be

patient.



                             CAMP WHITE, October 19, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE:--You are a prophet.           Brough's majority is

"glorious to behold." It is worth a big victory in the field. It is

decisive as to the disposition of the people to prosecute the war









             <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          441</B>



to the end. My regiment and brigade were both unanimous for

Brough.

  Lucy will go to Chillicothe and home this week. She will fix

up matters, gather the chickens, and return in two or three weeks,

if all things look well, for the winter. She will, in that case, rent

the house in Cincinnati. Love to Birch.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  October 21. -- General Duffie with about one thousand men,

cavalry, and two guns of Simmonds' off last night; supposed to

be after the railroad bridge again.

  Lee followed Meade until he was near the defenses of Wash-

ington, when Lee is reported retiring again.





                             CAMP WHITE, October 21, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I received yours of the 17th this morning;

also one from mother of the 16th. Lucy left for home this morn-

ing with Dr. Joe. She will rent our house in Cincinnati, and re-

turn with our family two or three weeks hence, if things remain

as now. I gave her a letter to send for the pony, as well as

Birch, if agreeable to you. I am now entitled to two more horses

than I am keeping, and if we remain here, would like the pony

both for Birch and myself. I find little horses, if they are stout,

much better for the mountains. My sorrell stallion I want to

sell, because he is troublesome sometimes. He is a beauty and

good stock; worth two hundred or three hundred dollars.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



           CAMP WHITE, WEST VIRGINIA, October 21, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER: -- I received your letter of the 17th this morn-

ing. Our soldiers rejoice over the result of the Ohio election as









<B>442          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



much or more than the good people at home. They felt afraid

last winter that the people were getting disheartened and that

there was danger that the war would be abandoned just as we

were about to succeed. They saw, too, how much the Rebels

were encouraged by our divisions in the North. The men of my

regiment and my brigade were both unanimous for the Union

ticket. The brigade cast over eight hundred votes all one way.

I have seen no account of any equal body of troops who did as

well. . . .

  It is very uncertain what our movements this winter will be,

but I think I shall be able to come and see you by midwinter.

The time of mustering out my regiment is approaching and we

shall perhaps be sent home to recruit.  At any rate I think I

shall see you this winter. -- Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



                 CAMP WHITE, October 25, (Sunday), 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER:--I received your letter of the 19th last eve-

ning. We have been very busy here the last week, worrying the

Rebels in our front to prevent their sending reinforcing the

Rebels who are opposing General Burnside, and getting ready

for apprehended attacks from them. It is now quiet again and

the rain and snow in the mountains are fortifications getting

stronger every day.

  We are not allowed to build winter quarters yet, but the men

are fixing up all sorts of shelters and fireplaces to find comfort

these cold nights.

  I heard from Lucy after she was well on her way to Chilli-

cothe. . . .     I think it almost certain that she will come

back to stay in a fortnight or so.

  I hope you will stand the cold winter well. -- Love to all.

                   Affectionately, your son,

                                              RUTHERFORD.

                              CHARLESTON, October 30, 1863.

  DEAREST: -- General Kelley was here and reviewed the troops

on Wednesday. General Duffie's review was a beautiful and in-

teresting sight. Generals Kelley, Scammon, and Duffie with their

staffs have gone to Fayette--Miss Scammon, Miss Jones and

Miss Smith with them. I am now in command of their troops

here pro tem., and Avery and I run the machine on the town side.

  We have got the regiment and brigade tents on stockade for

winter weather. They look well and will be comfortable. Mrs.

Comly is in the house, and Mrs. Graves will vacate the rest in

a day or two. It now looks favorably for our family arrange-

ments to be carried out as we planned them. Can tell certainly

after General Kelley leaves.

  Uncle is so urgent for Birtie's staying longer with him that I

wish to consent unless you are very anxious to the contrary.

Birch says he would like to see us all but prefers to stay longer

at Fremont. -- Love to all.

                        Affectionately,

  MRS. HAYES.                                    R. B. HAYES.





  October 31. -- On the 28th General Kelley reviewed the Third

Brigade, [and] General Duffie's cavalry. A beautiful day; a fine

spectacle. I had only nine companies of the Twenty-third here--

a small affair. General Kelley is a gentlemanly man of fifty to

sixty; not an educated man--nothing particularly noticeable

about him.   [The] 29th, the three generals with their young

ladies, Miss Jones, Miss Scammon, and Miss Smith and staffs

went to Fayette. I [am] left in command here at Charleston.

[The] 29th, got into new quarters -- wall-tents on boards.





                 CAMP WHITE, (Sunday), November 1, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER: -- It is a lovely morning. I have just got into

new quarters, two tents together on a stockade, making two good

little rooms with a coal stove.  As cozy as need be. . . .

  We had preaching in our camp last Sunday by the chaplain of









<B>444          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



the Thirty-fourth, Mr. Collier, a rather entertaining speaker,

and have been promised meetings every other Sunday hereafter.

It is so unusual a thing that the novelty makes it attractive, if

there were nothing else to recommend it. . . . 

                    Affectionately, your son,

                                                RUTHERFORD.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.





  November 5, 1863.--A warm fall evening. How I am moved

as I read the letter below. My own dear boys, and my feelings

towards the soldiers who are kind to them; Willie too--the

name of sister Fanny's lost boy. Oh, and my dear sister too.

How many will love General Sherman for that letter who would

never care for any laurels he might earn in battle.

   [Pasted in the Diary is a copy of General Sherman's famous

letter to Captain C. C. Smith of the Thirteenth Regulars, thank-

ing the regiment--in which his little son Willie had fancied him-

self a sergeant--for  the "kind behavior" of its officers and

soldiers to his "poor child." "Please convey to the battalion,"

the letter says in conclusion, "my heartfelt thanks, and assure

each and all that if in after years they call on me or mine, and

mention that they were of the Thirteenth Regulars, when poor

Willy was a sergeant, they will have a key to the affections of

my family that will open all it has, that we will share with them

our last blanket, our last crust."]

  November 7, [1863].--I am asked if I would not be gratified

if my friends would procure me promotion to a brigadier-general-

ship. My feeling is that I would rather be one of the good col-

onels than one of the poor generals. The colonel of a regiment

has one of the most agreeable positions in the service, and one of

the most useful. "A good colonel makes a good regiment," is an

axiom.

  Two things make me sometimes think it desirable to have the

promotion, viz., the risk of having a stupid brigadier put over me,

and the difficulty and uncertainty of keeping up my regiment--

that is the risk of losing my colonelcy.

                           CAMP WHITE, November 8, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I received your letter of the 4th last night.

Very glad to hear Birch is still contented.  The tool-chest would

just hit his fancy. He ought to learn the use of tools, but I don't

imagine he has any mechanical turn. The only decent thing I

could ever make was a bow, and that was rather from a knowl-

edge of the best material than from any skill in whittling. . . .

  Stormy weather here. A large part of our forces is out after

a fight with a considerable Rebel force in the mountains. We

are anxiously waiting the result. Only two companies of my im-

mediate command is [are] out. This probably the last of our

campaigning in this quarter for a season.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  November 9. -- The ground is white with snow for the first

time this year. Drs. Mussey and Blaney called Saturday. It is

intimated that there will be difficulty, or is danger of difficulty,

on account of Dr. Webb's long absence.

  November 21. Saturday. -- Went to Gallipolis to meet the

family, -- Lucy, Webb, and Rud with Grandma Webb.

  25. -- Lucy and I came up on the Viola.

  26. -- Thanksgiving Day. Reports of fighting at Knoxville,

Chattanooga, and with Lee. If the result is generally favorable,

we shall see daylight plainer than ever; if otherwise, darkness

again but not so "visible" as before.

  December 3, [1863]. -- The recent victory of Grant near Chat-

tanooga seems to be very complete. We have not heard from

Burnside, besieged in Knoxville by Longstreet, since the 24th or

25th. We have some apprehensions, but hope that he has been

relieved by Grant's success. Meade has pushed into the heart

of eastern Virginia after Lee.  I fear the result.  The Army of

the Potomac has been as unlucky on Virginia soil as the army of

Lee on our soil.









<B>446          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Company B left today for home, over three-fourths, fifty-four,

having enlisted as veteran volunteers. Companies A, E, and F

are likely to follow suit.





                            CAMP WHITE, December 3, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER:--We are all here living very comfortably.

Webb and Ruddy are learning lessons daily. Webb is a little

backward and hates books. The other little fellow is like Birch

and takes to larnin'."

  Lucy writes very few letters to anybody and avoids it when

she can. She finds a sympathizing friend on this subject in Mrs.

Comly, who dislikes it equally. When I am with Lucy, I do

the writing.

  We are likely to be engaged in pretty active operations here

this winter. We are doing all that the weather allows, and have

been pretty lucky so far. It will not surprise me if we have

some rather severe fighting.

  My regiment is re-enlisting daily. There is no doubt that it

will be reorganized for three years more before the winter is

over. There is a general disposition with officers and men to see

the end of the war in the field, if our lives and health are spared.

Your letter mailed 30th came last night. Quick time!--My

love to all.

                   Affectionately, your son,



  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



                           CAMP WHITE, December 4, 1863.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- Lucy and I have considered your bulletin an-

nouncing your determination to hold Birch. I now write to give

you fair warning that the Twenty-third has re-enlisted for the

war. We are entitled therefore under a late order to be fur-

loughed in a body. One company has gone to Ohio already, and

more are preparing to go as soon as the situation here will allow.

Now, if you want war we can give it to you. I can take com-









              <B>MORGAN'S RAID AND MINOR OPERATIONS          447</B>



panies enough of veteran volunteers to recapture our boy. So

be on your guard.

  We are threatened with a Rebel invasion again. If they don't

come after us it looks now as if we should go after them. When

this is over our men will generally go home, and I am pretty

likely to go also. About the last of this month or early in

January if matters go well I shall probably visit you. All well

here.

  Let Birch write to his Grandma Hayes as often as he is dis-

posed to write at all. She is very much pleased with his letters.

--Good-bye.

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  [December 18, 1863].--December  8.  Started P.  M.  for

Gauley (a campaign to Lewisburg). Avery, Mather, McKinley,

third, whole of Fifth Virginia under Colonel Tomlinson, Ninety-

first and Twelfth of Colonel White's brigade, General Duffie's

with Sharp. 15th, at Meadow Bluff. 16th, returned twenty-

seven miles to Mrs. Jones'. 17th, to Gauley, Loup Creek, and

I talked of it and lived it over on this eleventh anniversary. A

happy day.









<B>448          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  [In the] evening, spoke to the men again about re-enlisting

as veterans. I want three-fourths of the present. We have two

hundred and fifty-five. Our present total five hundred; of these

we deduct officers twenty-five, invalids fifteen, recruits having

more than one year to serve seventy-five -- total one hundred and

fifteen, [leaving] three hundred and eighty-five. Three-fourths

[would be] two hundred and eighty-eight.
