                                    SPIEGEL, May 10, 1887.

MY DARLING:--Your mother goes with me to Colum-

       bus tomorrow or next day.       It is not certain as to

her going with me to Hampton, Virginia. Probably not. I go to

Columbus to attend a meeting of the trustees of the Ohio State

University, and to Hampton to attend the meeting of the Slater

trustees.

  This day is one of my anniversaries. Twenty-five years ago

I was in sole command of a small body--nine companies of

Twenty-third, perhaps four hundred and fifty men, a section

of McMullen's Battery, about forty men, and some three hundred

to four hundred cavalry of the Second Virginia.  We had

marched into the enemies' country some forty or fifty miles in

advance of our main army under General Cox. I knew [we]

were very likely to be attacked by a greatly superior force and

was up and out a mile or two, to our picket in the direction of

the enemy before daylight. My duty, as I saw it, was not to re-

treat until I knew the attacking force was largely superior to

mine. Yet I must move in time not to be destroyed or gobbled.

The sole responsibility made me anxious, but it also made me

insensible to personal danger.  I soon found the enemy were

probably three thousand or four thousand strong.  I put on a

bold face and fought them until my camps and trains were ready

to go, or were out of danger.  All the forenoon we maintained a

retreating fight; got off safely.  My first wound--a shell frag-

ment hit the right knee. I feel it yet.

                      Affectionately,

  MISS FANNY HAYES                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

                         <B>(324)</B>









             <B>INTEREST IN STATE UNIVERSITY          325</B>



  May 12.  Thursday.  Columbus. -- We reached here after an

agreeable trip at about 10 P. M. and were welcomed warmly by

Laura and the young folks.

   I learn by the morning paper that a meeting of the university

board was held the 10th. My predecessor, Mr. S. H. Ellis, made

his farewell speech to the board. Suitable resolutions of regret

were passed. I do not know the ground of his non-reappoint-

ment. When the matter of appointment was named to me, I

said distinctly that I would not compete for the place for [with]

any one, nor take the place at the expense of a removal of any

one on my account. I was told there would be a vacancy in any

event. Hence my consent to serve. I declined to say even this

much in advance. If appointed, I would consider it. The place

came to me and I am now pleased with it.

   Called 11 A. M. on the governor. He is absent at Yellow

Springs. Also an Mr. Alexis Cope, secretary of the board

of trustees.  Two  things he calls attention to:--The trouble

with the Grange element who complain that the farming interest

is neglected, and the fact that the president [of the university]

is not the ideal president. President Scott gets on well with

the faculty, but does not magnetize students, nor the public. He

is however, plainly, so good that he will do, and must not there-

fore be disparaged.

  The next meeting of the board is on the 20th of June, Mon-

day; to be together the 18th, Saturday evening, so as to hear the

baccalaureate sermon, Sunday, 19th.

  Afternoon, called on Judge Bates. He has lost his wife re-

cently. We kept away from sorrows and talked only of old times

-- pioneer days -- and managed to have a cheerful half-hour to-

gether.

  May 13.  Friday -- I made a hasty run through the college.

The geological collection is very valuable. The equipment in

many respects is creditable. The weak points are the library, the

preparation for mechanical industrial education and, I suspect,

also for agricultural manual training. The military drill was

good.

  I met Professors Norton, Tuttle, Smith, Knight, Weber, Derby.









<B>326          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



I found President Scott a gentleman of good presence, and with

culture and ability for his place--so far as I could judge by a

brief interview.

  I noticed a lack of attention to trees and grass.  The arbore-

tum, if there is one, I did not see. More trees should be along

the main drive, especially on the south side.

  May  18.  Wednesday.      Richmond, Virginia.--After a hot

day reached here about 6 P. M. The ride from daylight, at

Jackson River in the Allegheny Mountains, was very agreeable

until by an accident in front of us to a freight train we were de-

layed three hours as we were drawing near to Charlottesville.

This was tedious in the heated cars and lost us the train to New-

port News, compelling me to spend the night at the Exchange

and Ballard--a good hotel.

  Before reaching Richmond, Mr. Wickham, the president of

the railroad, came aboard and asked me to stop with him over-

night, promising to get me into the city in time for this morning's

train.  I declined on account of trunk, dirt, etc.  Mem.:--Always

travel with a valise also.

  The landlord, Mr. Carrington, was very kind. Visited the

capitol; a caucus on the debt question, the lieutenant-governor

speaking, so an old gentleman in the park told me. He "knew

the voice."

  Rode over the bridge in street car to Manchester. A youngster

with his basket told me the colored people were assuming too

much; they not only rode in the cars, but they remained seated

when white men were standing. The Knights of Labor were

strong until they were hurt by "social quality." "Enough social

quality now.  Don't want any more."  He was from Pennsyl-

vania; had been here two years; liked it well.

  Called at the governor's house. He was not in. Left my

card.

  May 27.  Friday. -- Was with my post of the G. A. R. at To-

ledo to attend unveiling of General Steedman's monument. Great

crowd. Rain interrupted the principal address. My view of the

matter is, Steedman, a rough man of force and heart, reckless

in all money matters, a gambler and licentious, was prompt in tak-









             <B>GENERAL STEEDMAN'S INFLUENCE          327</B>



ing the right side in the war; by pen, voice, and example, did

more for the cause than any other man in this region. He pre-

vented Democrats by the thousand from going wrong. A divided

North was our danger. On that question, as a Democrat of the

Democrats, he had a power and an influence which no score of

Republicans that you can name ever had or could have.

  May 28. Saturday. -- Yesterday W. D. Howells and his sister

called. A happy greeting and meeting. He warmly commended

Tolstoy's writings.

  May 29. Sunday.--The memorial service went off beauti-

fully at the Presbyterian church. Mr. Barnes preached a good

warlike sermon. The music by Dorr was excellent. The sing-

ing was appropriate. The closing with the "Battle Hymn of the

Republic," in which the audience joined in the chorus, was es-

pecially fine.

  Reading the novel of Tolstoy's, "Anna Karenina."

  May 31. Tuesday.--Two special items today, one sad, one

very gratifying. Thomas R. Trowbridge, of New Haven, died

last week. He was a distant relative. Rutherford was his mid-

dle name. His mother was a Hayes, and the Hayeses are de-

scended also from the Trowbridge of early times. He was a

genial, friendly, patriotic, benevolent, and just man. With a good

estate by inheritance, a good business man also, he has been very

fortunate in his life. Lucy and I visited him in 1880 at the

Yale commencement. I also called on him last winter. He was

then suffering [with] the disease which caused his death. A

good and a fortunate man has left us. One of the noted men of

our connection.

  The Supreme Court has decided in favor of General Runkle

in the case in which I have taken a great interest. Runkle, a

wounded officer, was put on duty in the Freedmen's Bureau.

  June 3. Friday. -- The news of Mr. Wheeler's near approach

to his end seems to be confirmed. To use his own phrases, he

was a "rare man"; "every fibre of his nature" was sound and

true. He was one of the few Vice-Presidents who was on cor-

dial terms--intimately and sincerely friendly -- with the Presi-









<B>328          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



dent. Our family all were heartily fond of him. He came often

to the White House and often expressed in strong language the

pleasure his visits gave him. In character he was sterling gold.

  June 4.  Saturday.--One of my anniversaries.  Fifty-three

years ago today I came in the stage with mother, Uncle Birchard,

and Sister Fanny to this town en route for New England to visit

our grandparents at Brattleboro, Vermont, and the relatives in

Vermont and Massachusetts. We left Delaware about 4 A. M.,

reached Lower Sandusky (here) about 8 or 9 P. M. It rained

near Upper Sandusky. This caused delay. Mother stopped six

miles up the river on account of a sick headache, at Mrs. Frary's

tavern. This was my first visit to this town, June 4, 1834. I

celebrated it by buying Lucy and myself each an elegant rock-

ing-chair of Delaware make.

  Mr. Wheeler, ex-Vice-President, died this morning of soften-

ing of the brain. One of the excellent examples of a New

England man of ability and character, who by sheer force of

perseverance, integrity, and good conduct, rose from poverty to

independence and honorable place. I will start for his home in

northeastern New York at Malone tomorrow evening.





            MALONE, NEW YORK, Wednesday, June 8, 1887.

  MY DARLING:--We start home this morning via Niagara.

This note ought not to be more than twelve or twenty-four hours

ahead of us. Our hosts are Mr. Lewis, a son of Honorable

Samuel Lewis, of Cincinnati,--formerly a minister of the

Methodist Episcopal Church, now of the Episcopal church here

and for four years past. All very agreeable.

  I was met by a special train at Norwood, thirty or forty miles

before [reaching] Ogdensburg, and run here just in time for the

funeral. The sermon of Reverend [Mr.] Richardson was perfect

--all you would wish in all respects.  The whole affair capitally

managed. I called at the home of Mr. Wheeler; greeted

warmly by the housekeeper on your account. Three or four

ladies at the memorial meeting in the evening heartily shook

hands and sent good words to you.









             <B>DEATH OF VICE-PRESIDENT WHEELER          329</B>



  The memorial meeting was good of its sort. Many talkers. I,

of course, among them.

  Malone is a much more thriving town than I had supposed.

It grows well and is quite charming. . . .  It was altogether

best that I came.

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                    SPIEGEL, June 13, 1887.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:--I am glad to have your dispatch. The

visit is to be. Tell Mrs. Smith we rely on her to keep you up

to it.

  I am glad you can speak so well of Schurz' book on Clay.

But no man can realize to this generation the love and admira-

tion he inspired in the most intelligent people of average condi-

tion -- no, of all conditions in America. . . .

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.





  June 25.  Saturday. -- My topic for army reunions is to be for

this summer: How to prepare for war in time of peace. Not

by fortifications, by navies, or by standing armies. But by poli-

cies which will add to the happiness and the comfort of all our

people and which will tend to the distribution of intelligence

[and] wealth equally among all. Our strength is a contented

and intelligent community.

  1. Instruction in the rudiments of military training, at all

public schools and in all colleges.

  2.  Education -- not learning, not mere scholarship -- by train-

ing of brain and hand and eyes.

  3. National aid in the South for education.

  By the results of our war we are made the guardians of the

peace of the world. The world's highest interest is in our cus-

tody--our sacred keeping.  We are to have the place of the

great pacific power. Germany or Russia is the great warlike









<B>330          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



power. Great Britain is the great naval power, but we are the

peacemaker, if we intelligently and wisely take advantage of

the results of the War for the Union.

  June 28.  Tuesday. -- Lucy and I with Laura Fullerton went

over to Toledo this morning to look at the nest Birchard and

Mary are building.

  Comly reported near his end. Saw him looking much better

than I supposed he would be. I am ready to help him as if he

were my brother; so told his wife and him. Will take him and

her fine presents of the sort they need in their present affliction

if I can think of such; if not, why, money! I wish I knew what

[would] give them the most happiness and comfort. Possibly

to hire a nurse and other servants extra.

  July 3. Sunday. -- Last night my successor, John Correy, was

installed as Noble Grand of Croghan Lodge. This is a great

relief. Mere attendance was a task. Then to look after the sick

and the funerals of the dead was a care. I have made it a rule

through life to attend well to the humblest duties assigned to

me as [an] official, or committeeman, or otherwise. This has

been a necessity for me, with my feelings and notions of duty.

It has also been a powerful aid. One gets the reputation of re-

liability, makes acquaintances favorably, gains friends, becomes a

necessity or a providence to others, and is therefore supported

and pushed ahead. Both for self-comfort and self-interest, I

advise the young to this course.

  July 8. Friday. -- At Toledo. Called also on General Comly.

I saw Mrs. Comly and the young lady. A sad and anxious fam-

ily. My old friend is again worse. He suffers a great deal--

was hardly conscious. Mrs. Comly told me that it was selfish

in her to wish him to stay. "He is so good a man, so brave, so

gentle, so kind always." He wishes to escape further suffering.

Death will be a relief to him.

  As friends go it is less important to live. My two nearest

friends, Comly and Force, seem to be gone. I still hope for

Force, but how can I?  His mind I fear is leaving him.









             <B>DEMOCRATS AND FRAUD ISSUE IN 1880          331</B>



  July 11, 1887. Monday. -- Governor R. B. Bullock having

sent me a newspaper in which he speaks favorably of me, of my

Administration, of Mrs. Hayes, and of my availability as a can-

didate for President in 1888, I wrote hastily as follows:--



Confidential.

                               FREMONT, OHIO, July 11, 1887.

  MY DEAR GOVERNOR:--I thank you  for the copy of the

 [Atlanta] Constitution, and am greatly gratified that you can

speak in a way so complimentary of my public conduct.

  It is not necessary, I suppose, to assure you of my settled pur-

pose not again under any temptation to take part in public life.

  My preference for our next candidate is Mr. Sherman, and

under no circumstances would I consider it [a nomination].  The

action of both parties in 1880 and the result of the election of

that year afforded ample recognition of my title and of the ac-

ceptability of my Administration. The Democratic party, if they

would insist upon the fraud issue, were bound to renominate Til-

den. Their failure to do it was a confession of judgment on

that question. Besides, they did nominate Hancock, who was

openly and decidedly against the fraud issue and personally and

officially friendly to me.

  On the other hand, the Republican party took bold ground on

the fraud issue. Senator Hoar presided over our convention.

He was one of the Electoral Commission. The convention nom-

inated for President the public man who, of all others, was most

closely identified with the decision in my favor and against Til-

den.  He was a "visiting statesman" to Louisiana and reported

to me and [to] the President and the country that Louisiana in

equity and law belonged to the Republican column. As one of the

Electoral Commission he insisted with vigor and determination

on every step that led to the final result, and voted with the eight

who decided the contest in my favor. Had he voted otherwise

the issue would have been different.

  The Democrats made the point against Garfield Tilden him-

self in person urged it in public speech and in letters. The peo-

ple in New York, Connecticut, and Indiana reversed their vote of

1876 and decided in our favor. This is sufficient endorsement.









<B>332          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I have never had any misgiving about 1876 since the facts

were fully known. We were equitably entitled to more States

than were counted for us and to a decided majority of the popu-

lar vote. But this is ancient history. Your kind words are very

grateful to me. I can say positively that I am content. I tried

to do well--to benefit the whole country by restoring the old-

time good feeling between South and North. I think something

was accomplished.

                Sincerely, your obliged friend,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GOVERNOR R. B. BULLOCK,

    Atlanta, Georgia.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 14, 1887.

  DEAR SIR:--Your letter of last month is before me.  You

do not need a six-thousand-dollar church. It is a sin to attempt

to build it in your circumstances. A suitable church, tasteful and

convenient, can be built for two thousand five hundred dollars

to three thousand five hundred dollars.  All you spend more

than this is for vanity's sake.

  For the privilege of giving you this sensible advice, I send you

ten dollars with best wishes.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES,

  REVEREND F. G. MCCAULEY,

    Gambier, Ohio.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, July 23, 1887.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I have just received your note. It seems to

me almost a certainty -- indeed I am confident -- that your nom-

ination will be unanimously favored by the convention. If, how-

ever, there is opposition and a vote taken, your decision to re-

quire "substantial" unanimity presents a question of some diffi-

culty. The mere "off-ox" men to be found in all large bodies

are not to be regarded. This, of course, with two hundred--

almost one-third--against the resolution you could hardly call

the vote 'substantially" unanimous. With less than one hun-

dred in opposition, or less than one in seven, it seems to me









             <B>DEATH OF GENERAL COMLY          333</B>



clear that you would regard the vote as practically unanimous.

With one-seventh against you, query?

  I have tried to draw the line as I see it. But the event will I

trust, relieve you of all embarrassment by giving you a hearty

endorsement by acclamation.

                          Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

     Mansfield.



  July 24. Sunday. -- We are deeply interested in the affliction

of our friends, General and Mrs. Force [now visiting us]. He

is a noble gentleman.  With scholarship and elegant culture in

many directions, with all manly virtues; honorable, heroic, and

scrupulously upright; thoughtful and punctilious in regard to

every duty; by reason of intense overwork in his office as judge

of the superior court of Cincinnati, his nervous system is broken

down, and the strange delusion that he has been charged with

dishonesty of some sort has taken possession of him. This men-

tal hallucination we cannot remove. He has been advised to go

on a sea voyage.  He came here to stay ten days and then go by

steamer from New York to Antwerp. He thinks his best friends

suspect him  and  treat him  with contempt.  "Why  did ----

call me a dog?" I instantly denied it. He seemed to be stag-

gered by the positive and indignant denial. It is an instance of

his delusions. Very sad.

  July 25.  Monday.--I visited Comly [at Toledo].  All at

home. He is not conscious; a great sufferer. Mrs. Comly says

she has passed through the great trouble.

  July 28.  Thursday. -- General Comly died last night just be-

fore 10 P. M. My loved comrade all the years of the war! My

devoted and most valued friend ever since!  A  clear, gentle,

brave soul! At 5 P. M. went over to Toledo; visited Mrs. Comly.

A lovely family all of them. A noble widow.

  July 30.  Saturday.--  . . . To Keeler's grove near Fort

Meigs. Here was a meeting of the Maumee Valley Monumental









<B>334          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Association. In charge, General John C. Lee, Asher Cook, Keeler

and others. I was announced as president of the day.

  August 1. Monday. -- With General Force and wife and Hor-

ton to Orrville en route for Baltimore, New York, and across

the ocean to Antwerp. The general has been benefited by his

visit here. But the future is uncertain--full of anxiety for his

wife and friends.

  August 4.  Thursday.--My correspondent at Gambier is a

testy young clergyman. He wrote me a tart letter. I reply to-

day.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, August 4, 1887.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Let us be friends.  You are angry.  It is al-

ways a mistake to get angry because you are told the truth. I

wrote hastily and perhaps bluntly. I had a host of letters to

answer. I know perfectly your situation. I abhor church debts.

You are in an old community with no prospect of growth. To

go in debt, hoping to raise money abroad, is a mistake. There

is no lack of gospel privileges at Gambier. It is in no sense mis-

sionary ground. You admit the truth of my statement in cut-

ting down your plan one third. Let another third go.

  As to my letter, read it again. If you still find it offensive,

send me a copy or the original, and I will explain or ask you to

pardon me. I am too old to have any other [desire] except to

do precisely what is right towards you and towards every fellow

being. Call up your better nature and reply as it dictates.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  REVEREND F. G. MCCAULEY,

    Gambier, Ohio.



  August 5. Friday. -- Reverend John Theodore Kellam, of

Ripley, Huron County, Ohio, born July 30, 1809 [at] Concord,

Sussex County, Delaware, emigrated to Ohio May I, 1816, cross-

ing that day the Ohio river at Wheeling, and settled near Zanes-

ville in Newton township, with parents. Removed to Springfield

township, Putnam, Ohio.









             <B>PIONEER CIRCUIT RIDING          335</B>



  In twenty-first year to Granville and worked at carpentry.

Helped put the roof on the Baptist college. Then to Columbus,

Ohio, and worked on "Sugar in the Gourd." Thence to the

Quaker settlement in Delaware County. Licensed to preach in

1833 at Mount Gilead. "Thence my appointment [he says] was

at Lower Sandusky, Clyde, and a large number of other places,

on Touissant, and elsewhere; all together thirty-six places, many

of them at private houses and schoolhouses. No church buildings

of any sort in this town when I came here. Rev. William Sulli-

van was on this circuit with me--he in charge--but the work

fell largely on me. I preached in this place my first year in the

court-house often. We built the first church here on the corner

of Garrison and Arch street where Dr. Hilbish now lives. It was

almost out of town then.  I preached in it often.  Left here the

next year sick and went to Sandusky.

  "I knew Sardis Birchard [and] Judges Justice and Hulburd.

Birchard and Hulburd were engaged in taking care of the sick

and dying in cholera time. Birchard gave not less than five hun-

dred dollars out of his own pocket to support the sufferers and

to bury the dead.

  "The sheriff joined the church when I was exhorting in the

court-house.  Our members were:--Thomas L. Hawkins and

family, Samuel Treat and family, ---- Emerson and family,

Widow Frary, Jacob Bowlus and family, ---- Lighter and fam-

ily, Brice J. Bartlett (afterwards came out an infidel), Father

Henry Beck and family (four or five), and Rebecca Prior.

  "I have preached more or less ever since. I superannuated

some ten years ago. Have lived in Huron County over twenty

years.  I was presiding elder--two years at Maumee, and four

years at Wooster district.  Member of General Conference 1860

at Buffalo; voted then for the change of rules on slavery."

  On the Lower Sandusky circuit his salary was $56.68. All

that was allowed for salary was one hundred dollars, but all that

was collected was $56.68.  "Donations were made by a few per-

sons. Birchard gave me, perhaps, in clothing, etc., one hundred

dollars. I preached a funeral sermon on the Seneca Reservation

in 1834 while cholera was raging here; perhaps the only sermon

preached on Seneca Reservation.









<B>336          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  "I have often said that Birchard was the best man I ever

knew without the grace of God. I do not say this because he

was good to me. He was good to everybody. I ought not [to]

speak of him as 'without the grace of God,' for he had it in his

heart. He was merely at that time not a professor of religion."

  August 12.--A party in the evening for the young folks--

Grace Derr, of Wilkes-Barre, Emily Failing, of Portland, Ore-

gon, Mary Bulkley, of Hartford, Helen Reynolds, of Wilkes-

Barre, and Mary Goodloe, of Lexington, Kentucky, [school-

mates of Fanny and all house guests for some days]. Singing

very fine.

  August 13. -- The young people now eighteen at the table.

        Tennis, shooting at mark, and riding during the day.

Singing, and playing "hide and seek" at night, with dancing, etc.

  August 14. -- The visitors attended the Episcopal church to-

day. Lucy and I the Methodist. A young preacher of talents.

Two  faults growing in delivery.  The young walk about too

much. It is a bad practice. It withdraws attention from the

sermon.  Keep within a circle of two feet in diameter.       The

other is like unto it. They talk too much of themselves. "All

are fluent on self -- none interesting"; so in substance says By-

ron.

  August 16.  Tuesday. -- Our bevy of fine girls, except Miss

Mary Goodloe, left us last night. A happy visit for them and for

us.

  August 17.  Wednesday. -- Rutherford, at table this morning,

(only four of us present, viz., Rud, Scott, Lucy, and self,) said:

"Well, Farmington educates natural girls. I saw a New York

school  advertisement.   There  they teach them  how  to tell

pictures by the old masters from pictures by the new masters,

and how to select diamonds !" There is truth in what he says.

  August 19. -- Finished a short essay on General Comly for

the West Virginia Reunion next week.  Not what I would wish.

Too many interruptions. Arthur, of Springfield, talked over the

battle of Cloyd's Mountain. Gave a soldier of Brinkerhoff's reg-









             <B>FORAKER AND REBEL FLAGS          337</B>



iment money. [He] got "into the cooler." Dr. Brinkerhoff got

him out. I must stop giving money to "tramps."

  August 21.  Sunday. -- Auntie Davis came for the first time

to visit us at Spiegel [Grove]. Only think of it. One of our

earliest and most constant friends. Indeed Doctor and Mrs.

Davis have been steadfast and warm friends thirty-five or forty

years. They have not visited us. We often visit them.

  Mrs. Force is in great distress about the general. He still is

the victim of insane delusions. To attempt to control or confine

him as a lunatic may not be advisable and yet I can think of

nothing else that is practicable.

  September 3, 1887. -- August 24-26 at Wheeling. Attended

the monster reunion [of the Army of West Virginia] on the

island at the Fair Ground.

  [The] 29th, 30th, and 31st [of] August at the annual reunion

at Lakeside of the Twenty-third O. V. I.

  Both reunions were well attended and very enoyable. In his

speech at [the] West Virginia Reunion Governor Foraker wan-

dered off into the Rebel flags' return. He said he would not

leave such a subject "to [a] Massachusetts Mugwump and a New

York Copperhead," meaning the Secretary of War and the Presi-

dent. This and the like gave a partisan turn to speeches in

the evening at the hotel. I was with the soldiers in the tent at

the Fair Ground and knew nothing of it until the next morning.

  My connection with the partisan affair was this: A flag with

the portrait of President Cleveland was stretched across the

street the procession was to pass under.  It bore the legend:

"God bless our President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and

Navy of the United States."  It was believed by many that the

object was to excite the soldiers to violence. I with others took

the position that the true course was to pay no attention to it,

or to salute it respectfully. I took off my hat and saluted it as I

passed under it.  No trouble occurred anywhere near the head

of the procession where I was. But later, bodies of the G. A. R.

men to avoid passing under it obliqued.

                          SPIEGEL GROVE, September 6, 1887.

  MY DEAR GUY:--Your kind remembrance of me from Monte-

rey is appreciated. I am just now overwhelmed with company

and work. We are pained to hear of Mrs. Ballinger's illness.

All who interest you are interesting to us. I am called upon for

all sorts of work.  Witness these talks.  Don't bore yourself to

read them except when nothing else is possible.

                     Sincerely.  As ever,      R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE G. M. BRYAN,

    Texas.



  September 7.  Wednesday. -- Addressed fifteen thousand peo-

ple at Toledo gas celebration.  How will it turn out?  Finlay,

the Democratic millionaire, said to me: "I am a Democrat, but

I always say you were a good President. You honestly tried to

do the best you could for the country."

  September --, 1887. -- Friday [the] 9th via Buffalo, Lewiston,

and steamer on Lake Ontario to Toronto. Saturday, about 2 or

3 P. M., we (Professor Wayland and others) were met at the

dock by Honorable James Massie and others [and] taken to the

fine hotel (the Rossin House, kept by Mr. Irish). A noble wel-

come in the evening by the lieutenant-governor, mayor, bishop of

Huron, Baldwin, and others. [I] added to my printed speech

a warm and semihumorous talk which was well received.

  A good, strong prison reform sermon by Bishop Baldwin Sun-

day. Lunch with Professor Goldwin Smith and wife; Professor

Wayland  with me.     Interesting conversation with Professor

Smith on English and Canadian politics. He describes Glad-

stone as a demagogue.

  Prison Congress opened Monday. Excellent meetings. Mon-

day evening dined with McMasters; Tuesday evening with Lieu-

tenant-Governor Campbell. Both occasions unexpectedly cor-

dial and enjoyable.



                      TORONTO, Tuesday, September 13, 1887.

  DARLING:--Better and better.  I wish you were here.  We

dined with the leading dissenter last night. All excellent and









             <B>PRISON CONGRESS AT TORONTO          339</B>



hearty. They would have sent an earnest appeal to you to come

and be their guest but for lack of previous acquaintance; and it

would have been lovely. Both are models. She went to school

in Norwalk about the time I did. Interested in many common

acquaintances and topics. We will visit them perhaps some day.

  I go to Philadelphia tomorrow, Wednesday.

                            Ever,

  MRS. HAYES,                                               R.

    Fremont.



  September --, 1887. -- Wednesday morning with Mr. Alfred

H. Love, of Philadelphia, left for Philadelphia via Buffalo.

  . . .  [The] 15th, reached Philadelphia about 11 A. M.  Mr.

Cassidy took me to the Aldine Hotel.

  About 2 P. M. General McCook took me across to the grand-

stand on Broad Street and [I] saw the whole industrial parade.

  That evening at the reception of Cardinal Gibbons met also

Archbishop Ryan, Bishop Gilmore, etc., etc.  [On the]  16th,

military display. Met President Cleveland at [the] Merchants'

Exchange. In the evening of [the] 16th escorted Mrs. Cleve-

land to her place of receiving in the Academy of Music. Did

not see the Foraker affair, although I was very near it.

  In the line of those who received were President Cleveland,

Mrs. Cleveland, Mrs. Fairchild, myself, [and] Secretary of State

Bayard, in the order named. The President shook hands with

all who came. Mrs. Cleveland, for some time, as suggested by

the ushers, only bowed to the passers. After a while she with

friendly warmth shook hands with all, and the rest of us on her

left followed suit. This compelled some delay. The ushers sug-

gested haste. Mrs. Cleveland resumed her fan. But again and

again the order was changed. When Governor and Mrs. For-

aker came I shook hands of course with both and introduced

both to Mrs. Fairchild on my left.  I did not see the affair

which has caused so much comment. Governor and Mrs. For-

aker told me of it at the hotel. Mrs. Foraker said: "Mrs.

Hayes would never have treated any human being as Mrs. Cleve-

land treated me." Mr. Bushnell's account of it must be accepted

as the truth until it is satisfactorily explained. I regret it.









<B>340          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Mrs. Cleveland has appeared so kindly and full of heartiness

that one can't but hope and think well of her. What an oppor-

tunity she now has! If she were to publicly admit her mistake

and apologize to the Governor and Mrs. Foraker, how all the

world -- the good of the world -- would approve and applaud.





                         PHILADELPHIA, September 17, 1887.

  MY DARLING:--You will see by the enclosed that I had over

two hours with Mrs. Cleveland and exactly how she looked. It

is said, I fear truly, that she failed to take Mrs. Foraker's hand.

Mrs. Foraker said to me this morning that "Mrs. Hayes never

would have done that to anyone" ! ! ! You see the feeling. Other

matters of the same sort are not pleasant. But on the whole it

was a lovely time.

  How I wish you were here. You are as much loved and re-

spected here as ever, or more. Constantly I was greeted during

the two hours' handshaking on your account.

  I now expect to come Monday or Tuesday. Will dispatch

you.

                           As ever,

  MRS. HAYES,                                                R.

    Fremont.



Private.

                        FREMONT, OHIO, September 21, 1887.

  DEAR SIR: -- Your favor of the 16th is before me. My im-

pression is that your "opponent" is correct in his statement of

the fact that the resolution referred to was presented by Mr.

H. R- and probably his view of the matter is also correctly

given.

  The committee did not suppose the time had come to aban-

don Reconstruction as the leading and vital issue. No declara-

tion at all on the prohibition issue would probably have been

their preference. They certainly did not wish to commit the

party for or against it. The declaration against "unconstitu-

tional laws" was probably regarded as good politics in a case

where non-committallism was the policy of the platform makers.









             <B>MRS. CLEVELAND AND MRS. FORAKER          341</B>



It was silently acquiesced in by the friends of prohibition, and

avoided a breach with its adversaries.

  All this is my personal notion of it, not intended for publi-

cation or other use aside from your own satisfaction.

                          Sincerely,

  L. C. BREESE,                                  R. B. HAYES.

    Portage, Wisconsin.



                       FREMONT, OHIO, September 25, 1887.

  MY DEAR GUY:--You are as ever true and generous.  Of

course, I find few men who will see all these things with your

practical eyes. And yet I am not rarely gratified in the same

way. The governor of South Carolina, on the grandstand at

the Centennial in Philadelphia, a few days ago, greeted me with

emphatic and public commendation on the part of himself and

his State in the most generous way, and they were very cordial

on the same ground.

  The friendship, personal and political, of Republican leaders

is all I could wish. Of necessity, in the political and partisan

warfare of the time the hot-headed take umbrage at my cooler

and, as I think, fairer way of dealing with these matters. I hav[e]

preferred to let some years pass before I take up the history

of the past, if I ever do it. But for your constant and consider-

ate support, all thanks.

                               Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.



  P. S. -- Mrs. Hayes and I are greatly pained to hear of the

serious illness of Mrs. Ballinger. What a throng of recollections

are called up by the mention of her name! Those golden days

of almost forty years ago on the Brazos! There must be as my

friend Comly says a hereafter to make all things even. I am

still called upon to speak--hence these scraps.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.



  October [2], 1887.--Favorable weather these days for the

annual conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Bishop









<B>342          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Bowman [our guest], a natural, amiable, and entertaining gentle-

man; formerly a chaplain of the Senate. Also a delightful col-

loquial preacher--tender, pathetic, and effective.

  Among our guests also for a part of the time of the conference

were Rev. Dr. Bayliss, of the Western Christian Advocate, the

President of Baldwin [University], at Berea, Rev. Fitz Walter,

of Wauseon.

  We had a reception Friday evening. Four hundred present.

[We]  invited the conference [and] their entertainers to meet

Bishop Bowman, President and Mrs. Payne, and Presiding Elder

Whitlock and Mrs. Whitlock.

  The good sermons I heard were by the Bishop and Rev. Dr.

Bayliss. Chaplain McCabe was happy as usual on church ex-

tension.

  I spoke twice Saturday; afternoon on woman's home missions

and evening on industrial education. Well enough.





                                   SPIEGEL, October 2, 1887.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your good letter of the 30th is before me.

I return the letter as to Parrott. No doubt the action is wise.

  I want to hear about Grandison. He spoke at our annual con-

ference in the church you corner-stoned. He is able and sen-

sible, if one may judge by a single speech.  Why not take him up

and give him the best advantages for scholarship and training

the world affords? He is coal-black of hue, African blood. As

we say of Jerseys, "he can be registered."

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  DR. HAYGOOD.





  October 3. Monday. -- Fanny and I go to New York to-

night to attend the Peabody meeting.

  Altogether the annual conference of the Central Ohio Con-

ference has been a happy time. Mrs. Hayes has enjoyed it,

and has been herself in making others enjoy themselves.

  The event of the time is the birth of a son to Birchard and









             <B>PEABODY BOARD MEETING          343</B>



Mary at Toledo, yesterday, 2 P. M., Sunday. . . .  The first

great-grandchild of the name of Hayes in the Brattleboro branch

of the Hayes family!  Therefore all hail to Sherman or Birch-

ard as the case may be!

  New York, October 5. Fifth Avenue Hotel. -- Three or four

hours spent in the meeting of the trustees of the Peabody Edu-

cation Fund. Present, Winthrop, Stuart (A. H. H.), Evarts,

Chief Justice Waite, Justice Manning, our Minister to Mexico,

General Jackson, ex-ditto, Governor Porter, of Tennessee, Bishop

Whipple, Drexel, J. Pierpont Morgan, Colonel Lyman, Dr.

Green, and self. Met in a large room on parlor floor at west

end of north hall.

   Mr. Winthrop began (a gentleman of the old school): "Our

meeting will be opened with prayer by Bishop Whipple." All

rose except Mr. Winthrop, now bent with the weight of years,

who leaned forward on his hands on the table. Bishop Whipple

in a quiet, distinct tone repeated the Lord's Prayer impressively

and added a few words. Mr. Winthrop then read his opening

address, which see.

  He called for [the] "records," accent on the last syllable, of

the last meeting. Dr. Green read the printed last year's report,

omitting resolutions of length, reports ditto, etc., etc., in a busi-

nesslike tone,--loud enough to be easily heard.

  Then in some detail Mr. Winthrop told how President Payne

was appointed by him, on the suggestion of Dr. Curry, as presi-

dent, subject to the confirmation of the board--president of the

Nashville Normal University.

  The business proceeded as usual. Justice Waite keeps his at-

tention fixed on the course of things, and is prompt in making

sensible and practical suggestions that are likely to be heeded.

No debating. Brief talks, hitting the nail on the head, and quit-

ting when done, is the uniform habit of all who rise to speak,

or who talk from their chairs. Mr. Evarts is quite as brief and

pithy as any member. No long sentences from him. Our rela-

tions with the local authorities in charge of the Nashville Nor-

mal would in most bodies have occupied hours. It was well dis-

cussed within twenty minutes at the outside. A body of highly

educated and able men wastes few words.









<B>344          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Governor Fish, too unwell to attend, sent a beautiful and dis-

criminating tribute to Governor Aiken, lately deceased.

  After working an hour and a half, a lunch of bread, crack-

ers, cold fowl, tongue, coffee and perhaps ale or wine, water

and apollinaris, was enjoyed for ten or fifteen minutes.

  Report of treasurer. About one million five hundred thou-

sand dollars in government bonds at 4 or 4 1/2 was debated.

Change favored into bond and mortgage at 5 and 6 per cent and

sell at 124 per hundred of United States bonds. Only three re-

main of Mr. Peabody's original board, viz., Winthrop, Fish,

and Evarts, out of sixteen! The three now out of health are

Manning, Stuart, and Lyman.

  October 6. Thursday.-- Last evening the Peabody dinner.

The members present the same as at the business meeting ex-

cept Judge Manning and Colonel Lyman--out of health.

  With Mrs. Winthrop.  I had an interesting time with her.

Forgetting that she was the daughter of Francis Granger, I was

agreeably surprised to find she knew General Force. Old times

were the source of good long conversations.       Her afflicted

daughter was on my left with Bishop Whipple. Ladies pres-

ent: Mrs. Winthrop, Mrs. Whipple, her daughter of Philadel-

phia, a large fine figure, Mrs. Paul, daughter of Drexel, Mrs.

General Jackson, Mrs. Waite.

  During the dinner, Mr. Porter, a committee of one from the

Loyal Legion opening dinner, came over after me. On my

telling him of General Sherman's presence, General Sherman

was also invited. A good time with Colonel Church as acting

commander at Delmonico's. Made a warm little speech. Then

taken to the Yacht Club, -- and another time.

  A. S. Sullivan, Esq., was the welcoming orator to the Scotch

Thistle men. They got him pretty full, and he greeted me with

the greatest gush about old times in Cincinnati. It was in spots

rather maudlin, but on the whole left a pleasant taste in my

mouth.  He is, I suspect, a fine gentleman and a good fellow.

At least, I shall so think of him in spite of his condition last

night.

   [At] 12:20 P. M., Peabody Board, all business done, ad-









             <B>PEABODY BOARD MEETING          345</B>



journed to first Wednesday in October 1888 here, unless Presi-

dent Winthrop and the executive committee otherwise determine.

Elected Mayor William A. Courtenay, of Charleston, South

Carolina, trustee to fill vacancy caused by death of Governor

Aiken.

  October 8.  Saturday. -- With Mr. Simon Stevens, a nephew

of "Old Thad," visited the Produce Exchange. Mayor Edson

and Mr. Milmine, formerly of Toledo, were with us; also Fanny,

Miss Stevens, Mabel Stevens, and Miss Pennington, of Phila-

delphia.  From top to bottom.  Also the lovely bay and the

Commissioner of Emigration's [Immigration's] house, etc., etc.

Dined with Schurz.  Met General Hastings and Emily in the

evening at 20 East Twentieth Street. Fanny sails with them

to Bermuda on the Orinoco, Thursday, 13th.

  A long talk with ----, a close friend of Garfield.  He now

is working up the case against Blaine. His list of cases or occa-

sions in which Blaine has acted with duplicity, falsehood, and

corruption is very long and if true frightful.

  Mr. and Miss Endicott called. Pleasant people. He told of

a toast an old Federal lawyer gave:  "The health of Joseph

Story [here there was dissent among his hearers], elevated to

the Supreme Bench from a hogshead in Wells's distillery, he

will be worthy of the place whence he sprang." Both parties

held their meetings in distilleries in the good old times of Adams

and Jefferson and were far more brutal in their attacks on each

other than they are in our day. Mr. Endicott told of the horse-

whipping of Joseph Story in his younger days.

  October 9.  Sunday.--Yesterday called on Whitelaw Reid

at his office. A short and agreeable interview. The danger is

that the Catholic Church will drive all its labor men back into

the Democratic party and that many Republicans will go to the

new party.  With my sympathy for the general cause of the

workingmen, this to me is not so awful. Let there be enough

good men in the new party to save it from dangerous measures.

  Called on Fred Mead -- good wife -- nice baby.  Ditto, Melvil

Dewey; also a long call on General Schurz.









<B>346          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                         FREMONT, OHIO, October 15, 1887.

  DEAR MADAM:--Your letter of the third came to my desk

during my absence, and has just been read.

  Pecuniary aid, applied for by strangers, is so common in our

circumstances, and often of so questionable a character, that

the letters asking for it are usually allowed to go unnoticed.

In this case, however, I say to Mr. N. Hulett, that if he approves

of the object he may pay you for the Duluth Home Society fifty

dollars and charge it to me. By showing him this note he will

be authorized to act.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES

  MRS. SARAH B. STEARNS,

    PRESIDENT DULUTH HOME SOCIETY.





  October 22.  Saturday. -- Returned last evening after a happy

time at Philadelphia. Presided over the Commandery-in-Chief

of Loyal Legion at the hall of the Pennsylvania Historical So-

ciety.  At the Meade Post G. A. R. banquet, a very enthusiastic

greeting.  Made a fair speech.  Again, Wednesday, at banquet

of Pennsylvania Commandery of Loyal Legion to the Command-

ery-in-Chief, at the Union League, gave them the close of the

battle of Cedar Creek, twenty-three years before; October 19,

1864.

  October 24.  Monday.--Webb came in time for breakfast

from his hunt in Wyoming near Utah and Idaho. He is strong

and healthy. Not much success with game. The Indians hunt

the large animals for food. About a third of their subsistence

must come from hunting.



                                 SPIEGEL, October 24, 1887.

  MY DARLING:--Spent last week at Philadelphia presiding

over Commandery-in-Chief of the Loyal Legion and unveiling

statue of General Meade.  On return found Lucy had gone for

three days to look after the boy and the settlement of Birch and

Mary in their new home.









             <B>ADVOCACY OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION          347</B>



  Webb returned from his hunt with General Crook in Wyo-

ming this morning. Never looked so well before.

  Our new preacher, Mr. Mills, with his wife, three daughters,

and girl Winnie, are still with us.  The parsonage will be all

right in a day or two when they will leave us.

  The other home in Toledo will have a large share of Spiegel

soon at the rate carpets and things are moving in that direction

under the energetic management of the new grandmother. Scott

counts on a room in the Ashland Avenue home. Thus with

you in Bermuda, and the rest at different Ohio places, Ruther-

ford and I will be left alone to continue the campfire at Spiegel.



  We all love you--but papa most.

                        Affectionately,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Bermuda.



  October 27. Thursday.--Evening visited VanDoren. His

talk of the town prospects is intelligent and interesting. The

town certainly is growing again. I talked of a village improve-

ment society of Fremont to Mr. Meek and Rutherford.

Another idea is that we give a reception to the newcomers and

their families, to be met by the Board of Trade and their fam-

ilies; the editors and preachers ditto.

  October 28.  Friday.--A  letter from Russell A. Bigelow,

grandson of my Uncle Russell Hayes, shows that he has caught

the genealogical fever. He inquires after the ancestors of Abi-

gail Hale and says, "Of the one hundred and twenty-eight an-

cestors back as far as the seventh generation, there are only

some thirty-two who are unknown to me." Well done.

  November 6.  Sunday. -- Returned last evening from a trip

via Toledo and the Ohio Central to Bucyrus and Cincinnati.

  At Bucyrus addressed a church full of the District Conference

and people in behalf of industrial education for high school and

college. Well received. Bucyrus is a fine town of seven thou-

sand; growing.









<B>348          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  At Cincinnati met with the Loyal Legion. A rambling, quiet

talk and told the incidents at Buford's Gap.

  Returned via Lima Saturday. On train met J. B. Townsend,

prosecuting attorney of Lima, and General Ewing. In quite

general accord with both as to the labor-capital question. A

few get MORE than their share, the working, productive many

get LESS than their share, is the corner-stone fact, is the evil to

be prevented in the future by peaceful and lawful means. We

agree that, of course, lawlessness and violence are to be put

down; order and prosperity are to be preserved.

  November 10.  Thursday. -- With Lucy visited Birchard and

Mary. All night with them Wednesday. First sleeping in their

new and beautiful home.  Workmen still engaged in finishing.



  Left home after voting. The election in Ohio, a victory for

the Republicans. In other States fairly so except New York.

I account for New York by the increased activity of the saloon

interest. In that State the Republicans made a square assault

on the saloons.  As usual in such cases, the saloon interest by

combining with the Democrats carried the day.

  Called on Mrs. Comly at her new home, 73 Locust Street, and

went over in a general way the proposed pamphlet or volume

in memoriam General Comly.

  November  13.  Sunday.--A  letter from  General  Sheridan

wanting my article or lecture on Cedar Creek. Sent him the pro-

ceedings of the reunion of the Army of West Virginia at Ports-

mouth in 1886 with my speech marked.

  November 14.  Monday. -- The Evangelical preacher, Schott,

preached a good sermon at the fifty-seventh annual county Bible

meeting. It gave a detailed and statistical account of the Bible.

[At] 10 A. M. met with the board at Wilson's office.

  November 15. Tuesday. -- At the Loyal Legion banquet in

Philadelphia I made a sprightly speech. It was the anniversary

of the battle of Cedar Creek. I referred to it. A man at the

lower end of the table, perhaps in liquor, asked, "Where were

you?" I replied, "If you had been there you would not ask









             <B>REPUBLICAN SUCCESS IN 1887          349</B>



that question." It brought down the house. I received an ac-

count of it "with the compliments of Admiral Almy, Washing-

ton, D. C."



Private.

                       FREMONT, OHIO, November 15, 1887.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Enclosed find a letter from [Thomas] Nichol

which please return. The general impression is that recent events

have improved your chances.

  When [I was] in New York before election Nichol predicted

failure this fall. He also urged me to bring to your attention

the importance of decisive action on your part, viz., that your

friends--naming  two  Illinois leaders, Farwell  and Jones--

should be in more intimate and cordial relations with you--in a

situation to confer freely and to act advisedly. I told him I

would inform you, hoping to meet you somewhere pending our

state election. He strikes me as sincere in his friendship.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.





  November 17. Thursday.--Washington's letter to his favorite

nephew Bushrod Washington, to whom he left Mount Vernon,

contains excellent and quotable sentences. Dated January 15,

1783.

  Webster's speech at the Washington Centennial, 1832, "The

Character of Washington," is worthy of careful reading. It is

referred to by Mr. Evarts in his argument to the jury in the

case of the officers and crew of the Savannah, tried for piracy

in New York in 1861.

  November 18. -- With Mr. White visited the newly-established

manufactures of the town, viz., the railroad spike factory, car-

bon works, drop-forge works, Clauss shear works, and fifth-

wheel works. All are new; all seem to promise well, and

all except one are already doing good work. These, with what

we already have, give good reason for the hope that this will









<B>350          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



be a place of prosperous manufacturing interests. Mr. White

says we will not equal or compete with Cleveland or Toledo,

but in ten years we may expect to have a population of twenty

thousand. It seems possible.

  November 19.  Saturday.--I told Mr. White I thought of

giving a reception to the newcomers. He approved of it heartily.

Invite all the newcomers and their wives [and] the other prin-

cipal manufacturers. Also journalists, clergy, city officers, and

a few [other] leading citizens.





        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, November 19, 1887.

  MY DEAR COMRADE:--It would indeed be a joy to meet you

and the comrades at your installation. No man in your audience

will be a happier listener to your soldier talk, when your turn

comes, than your Buckeye friend would be if he could attend.

But it is out of the question. This is one of my busiest months.

All I can do is to thank you for your invitation, and to assure

you of the lasting friendship and the warmest good wishes of

Mrs. Hayes and

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Please so report me with thanks to the committee of

Buckingham Post.

    CHAPLAIN, etc.



  November 20.  Sunday.--Attended funeral of Statira Dick-

inson.  She died of paralysis.  Went to sleep and never awoke.

She was taken to St. Ann's church.  With me as pall-bearers

were Haynes, Dr. Rice, Judge Finefrock, McCulloch. Father

McCarthy preached an orthodox, old-fashioned, eternal-punish-

ment sermon. Nothing noticeable, except the dogmatic way in

which he put it down -- "this is the doctrine of the church."

  November 25.  Friday.--Spent Thanksgiving at Toledo.  A

capital dinner and social reunion at Birchard's. Our first dinner









             <B>STEADFAST FOR SINGLE TERM          351</B>



with Birchard and Mary at their own table and in their new

home.

  I reached Columbus Monday, 4:30 P. M. . . .   Tuesday

met at the office of Alexis Cope, secretary of Ohio State Uni-

versity, Mr. Wing, president of the board, Mr. Booth, attorney

of Columbus, and Honorable Cowgill. The controversy between

the board of control of the experiment station, representing the

farmer sentiment of the State, and our university board is the

interesting point in the present situation. My impression is in

favor of a policy which will restore harmony between the uni-

versity and the farming interest. Let us grant to the experiment

station all the land and other privileges in our power, without

injury to the university, it being understood that in like manner

the friends of the experiment station will aid the university in

all proper ways.

  November 26.  Saturday.--W. K. Rogers  my  old friend,

and with me as private secretary during my term as President

at Washington, [is here]. A man of fine culture, noble senti-

ments, a true friend; too guileless for practical life, and so unsel-

fish and unsuspecting that his business ventures have generally

been failures. He is interested with me at Duluth. Hence his

visit. He talked entertainingly about the Presidential situation

in 1880. He says it was a surprise to my friends that I was in

earnest in refusing to think of a second term.  They could not

believe it. They argued that many Presidents, including Wash-

ington and Jackson, were committed against a second term, but

no President ever failed to accept it if offered, and to seek it

at the end of his first term, if seeking it was apparently neces-

sary to get it. Said he: "You have the distinction of being the

one President who, believing in the one-term principle, was true

to your convictions.  It would be a long story to tell of the

numbers who took an interest in the second-term talk for you."

  Rogers left for home via Wellington [at] 3 P. M.  He added

two thousand dollars to the debt for which I am his surety.

  November 27.  Sunday.--No book study merely--no study

without practice--gives a complete and thorough education.

lamation, debate, the habit of composition must be formed by

practice. Work must go with study. Geology and the other

sciences are to be learned well only by practical work. Thor-

oughly to understand a theory, we must be able to put it into

practice.

  I constantly find an advantage in working for educational and

benevolent enterprises in the fact that having been in the first

place, I am not suspected of wanting any personal promotion or

advancement.



                        SPIEGEL GROVE, November 27, 1887.

  MY DEAR FRIEND: -- It is too bad that we lost another chance

to see Mrs. Smith and you. Rogers was here yesterday. Our

talk of Washington days led us to you at every turn.

  Just now I am giving my thoughts to the Ohio State Uni-

versity at Columbus. It is in some respects not in a satisfactory

condition. It will come out in due time. If anybody was its

founder, in the words of George Corwin, "a great part of it I

am which." The land I worked so hard to get, now in the city

of Columbus, is already worth twice as much as the land-grant

fund, and will be in a few years worth millions.

  I am to be in Columbus again [the] 7th and 8th of next month.

When will you be there or in Cincinnati? I have no other en-

gagement before the 20th [of] December.

  With greatest regard of all here to all there.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES

                       FREMONT, OHIO, November 29, 1887.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- To encourage a young person striving for an

education is a labor of love. Unfortunately my senator, a very

worthy man, is not entitled to go into the caucus that would aid

you by its nomination. If you fail in this, do not give up.

There are many ways open to those who resolutely push.

                          Sincerely,

  E. P. NOEL.                                    R. B. HAYES.









             <B>A RECEPTION FOR NEWCOMERS          353</B>



  November 30. Wednesday. -- Emerson, as shown by Cabot,

is almost as good a democrat as I am. I read to Lucy his talk

about a separate table for servants, talking in their presence

in a way to wound their feelings, etc., etc. She said: "I am de-

lighted to hear that from Emerson. I don't think much of tran-

scendentalism, but that is good sense and good feeling too." I

said: "Yes, he is almost as good a democrat as I am." She re-

plied: "But don't say democrat; say republican. That means

everything good."

  December 2.  Friday.--Our reception to "all," particularly

the newcomers in the manufacturing plants and others, [last

night] went off beautifully. Lucy had a capital circle of lovely

and sensible ladies to assist her, viz., Mrs. Bristol, Mrs. Dorr,

Mrs. Ranck, and Mrs. Thompson. They were never surpassed

in our experience as ladies for such a place. The newcomers

were out in good force. The workmen, young and old, were

on hand with their employers and their wives. General Buck-

land, Mr. White, Dr. Wilson, Dr. Stilwell, Dr. Caldwell, Dr.

Smith, and other leading citizens were present in goodly num-

bers. Altogether about three hundred were in attendance. Our

preparations were for four hundred to five hundred and the

surplus was considerable. The idea of Mr. White and the

Board of Trade was no refreshments. Of course, Mrs. Hayes

and I insisted on "breaking bread" and "eating salt" with our

guests. Nothing else is quite worthy of the hospitable record

of Spiegel Grove. . . .

  This morning a tall, good-looking man called and after some

hesitation announced himself as A. H. Hale, from near Bata-

via, Genesee County, New York. Recently, as he squarely

stated, discharged as a convict from the Michigan state prison

after serving out a ten years' sentence for burglary and larceny

at Monroe, Michigan. By good conduct his sentence was fin-

ished in seven years and seven months. Was guilty but drunk.

With two others. One an older man than Hale, after they had

been drinking together, told them that his niece had eight hun-

dred dollars under her bed in his house. The two others got

into her room, told her to show them her money. This she got

   23









<B>354          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



up and did. "We were discovered next day. The old man

[was] not suspected by the citizens. The other turned state's

evidence, but got a five years' sentence. Was well treated in

prison. Chaplain Hickox was a good-hearted man. I had been

a steward in the Methodist Episcopal Church in Genesee

County. Had no confidence in the religion of the prison; would

not go to the church, or rather religious services generally, un-

less compelled. Catholics went; spoke in meeting and would

say they did it merely to aid in getting pardons.

  "The rule as to silence in prison does no good but harm only.

Talking  is not prevented.     But  misunderstandings  between

prisoners and quarrels would be prevented by an opportunity

for an explanation. Let them talk with proper rules as to dis-

cipline, etc., etc., as in free shops."

  He is a wagonmaker by trade. Wants to go home to New

York. Friends do not know of his misfortune and disgrace.

Got only seven dollars to return to Monroe from the prison

and a suit of clothes. I gave him fare to Buffalo where he

would be provided for and money, altogether about nine dol-

lars.  He promised to write to me.  Will he do it?

  December 4. Sunday.--In church it occurred to me that it

is time for the public to hear that the giant evil and danger

in this country, the danger which transcends all others, is the

vast wealth owned or controlled by a few persons. Money is

power.  In Congress, in state legislatures, in city councils, in

the courts, in the political conventions, in the press, in the pulpit,

in the circles of the educated and the talented, its influence is

growing greater and greater. Excessive wealth in the hands

of the few means extreme poverty, ignorance, vice, and wretch-

edness as the lot of the many. It is not yet time to debate about

the remedy. The previous question is as to the danger--the

evil. Let the people be fully informed and convinced as to the

evil. Let them earnestly seek the remedy and it will be found.

Fully to know the evil is the first step towards reaching its

eradication.  Henry George is strong when he portrays the

rottenness of the present system. We are, to say the least, not

yet ready for his remedy. We may reach and remove the diffi-









             <B>GROWING POWER OF WEALTH          355</B>



culty by changes in the laws regulating corporations, descents

of property, wills, trusts, taxation, and a host of other impor-

tant interests, not omitting lands and other property.





                         FREMONT, OHIO, December 4, 1887.

  DEAR SIR:--I am glad to hear from you that you are at

home and well. It will give me pleasure to hear from you

fully occasionally. I hope you will be careful of your health

and habits. I hope your friends are well and good friends to

you.

                           Sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MR. A. H. HALE,

    Batavia, New York.



  December  10.  Saturday.--Returned  yesterday  from  Co-

lumbus. A most agreeable visit at Laura's, with all things more

charming, if possible, than usual. The general, Fanny, Jean,

and John, all interesting. Fanny Fullerton in excellent health;

good accounts of all the darling young folks.

  The business of the meeting of the university board was im-

portant and somewhat critical. But all points of difference with

the experiment station were talked over between the two boards

and so adjusted in a friendly spirit that there is good reason for

the hope that the farmers of the State will be content with the

university as an institution for practical education, and give it

a support hitherto denied to it. Colonel Brigham, president of

[the] State Board of Agriculture, with Mr. Ellis, Mr. Stevens,

and Mr. Thorne -- all of the experiment station and represent-

ing  the  farmers  especially--took  part  with  the  university

board in all of the negotiations looking to a settlement of dif-

ferences.  I hope for the best.  As the results were largely my

work as a peacemaker on liberal principles, I am very solicitous

that all may turn out well.

  I read an article on the labor question in the National Bap-

tist, December 8, which set me to thinking of the unfair ad-









<B>356          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



vantages given to the very wealthy in the practical administra-

tion of the laws. Is this not true -- That in proportion to the

value of their estates the extremely wealthy pay far less taxes

than those of moderate means?  Compare the amount paid by

millionaires with the amount paid by ordinary  citizens.  I be-

lieve that in proportion to their estates they pay less than half

as much as ordinary citizens, whereas they ought to pay more.

  On my way down to Columbus I made an agreeable acquain-

tance with the superintendent of the new insane asylum at To-

ledo, Mr.

  Also, on return, with Isaac 1). Smead of Toledo--a builder

of ventilating furnaces and the like.

  Rev. John Henry Pitezell, of Three Rivers, Michigan, since

1862, was preacher in Lower Sandusky August 1835 to Sep-

tember 1836. Preached in upper part of the old frame church,

corner  of Garrison and  Arch  Streets.      John  Kinnear  was

preacher in charge.  Don't recall any brick houses in town.

No pickets at the fort. Same church members as in time of

Kellam. Bartlett in a liquor place as clerk. Got an anony-

mous letter supposed to be inspired if not written by him. Soon

after Bartlett left the church. In that day went Sunday morn-

ing ten miles [to] Mud Creek and preached at 10:30; thence

to Port Clinton and preached in the afternoon. In the evening,

about three miles down the lake, preached again. The active

men in the church were Hawkins, Bowlus, Beck, Priors, Main.

Preached at twenty-three or twenty-fours places, viz., Lower

Sandusky, at White's, Port Clinton, Peninsula, Portage (three

places), two in Black Swamp, east side of river up at David

Gray's, an old preacher (died at Findlay a few days or weeks

ago), at Treat's, Green Spring, at Butternut Ridge, east of

Green Spring, near Bellevue, Mr. Croft's a stone house, north

of Bellevue, Hamer's Corners, Stephenson's, three miles from

Hamer's Corners towards Sandusky, and a settlement in the

woods where "we used hickory torches to light us through the

woods." "Early candle-light" was the time of meeting, with tal-

low candles for light.

  Born  in Frederick County,  Maryland, fifteen miles from

Frederick, Graceham, April 18, 1814.  Left in 1823; came with









             <B>TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HENRY SMITH          357</B>



father to Ohio in Licking County, five miles west of Granville,

New Alexandria. Five years there; then to Tiffin in 1829.

Lived there five years. An apprentice five years with Jacob

Huss, a saddler.  Then to Norwalk in 1834.  Rev. John Edward

Chaplin, principal of the seminary.

  Chaplin drunk at a meeting, converted. At Norwalk a year

or more. Bishop Harris a student. He taught school at Hunt's

Corners. "I worked at a saddler's in Monroeville and taught

in Seneca County thirty scholars for twelve dollars per month."

  In April 25, 1835, licensed to preach, John H. Power, pre-

siding elder.  Went to Lima circuit--twenty-two appointments

-- one hundred dollars per year.  Some presents -- ten dollars or

twelve dollars. Fully paid; a suit of jeans also. Here one hun-

dred dollars per year.

  December 15.  Thursday.--William Henry  Smith, my old-

time near friend in Cincinnati thirty years ago or more, and

ever since, came Tuesday evening. Spent Wednesday and last

evening.  We went over to Toledo together and visited Birch and

Mary until his departure for Cincinnati. An able writer, a

most capable man of affairs, a wise public man, and with an

industry and perseverance rarely equalled.  He  has aided me

more in my public life than any other man.

  Met Lucy as I returned from Toledo today in town. Found

a young clerk in one of our clothing stores, Mr. Boalt, under

the care of Lucy at our home, as an invalid recovering from

a fever. Good woman!

  December 17.  Saturday.--"One secret of keeping young,"

says Rev. T. L. Cuyler, "is to keep at work, touching life at as

many points as possible." Old men, men who have passed "the

dead line of fifty," have done often their best work long after

middle life:  Milton, Wesley, Franklin, Gladstone, Bismarck,

Bancroft, Storrs, Adams (J. Q.), Stevens (Thad).

  December  18.  Sunday.--President  Hitchcock says: "We

mean that our boys and girls shall be able to teach something

besides the blue-backed speller."

  The delusion of the past in all our schools and colleges has

been that there is no mental training except in books, while in









<B>358          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



fact the best intellectual culture is to be found in learning how

to use skilfully the eyes and hands.





                               SPIEGEL, December 18, 1887.

  MY  DARLING:--Your  mother  last evening went over to

Toledo to spend Sunday with Mary and Birch. She went in

response to an urgent appeal from the children. They find

their new house not yet nearly finished. Little matters essential

to comfort are turning up to view every day to be changed or

put in. Webb made his first visit to the new home last Sunday.

He came back in a very complimentary mood. Their house, he

says, is the finest of its class (the giddy sort, called Queen

Anne); none superior, or even equal, to it, he says, either in

Toledo or Cleveland. As soon as the workmen get out of it,

they are coming to make us a two weeks' visit.

  We shall have a gay time holiday week. . . .  I send you

an Advocate and [a] Zion's Herald to keep up your Methodism.

If you don't read them you can show  them, as pirates show

the colors of great nations(!), to prove your character!     On

reflection, I fear the Zion's Herald will give too much sectarian

news for one week, and I therefore send you the Cincinnati

Gazette to furnish a dish of politics and agriculture.

  We had a good visit from my old friend and staunchest and

most efficient political supporter, Honorable William Henry

Smith, the chief manager of the Associated Press. He is a

good historical writer of the semipolitical, semiphilosophical

cast. He is now meditating, when all his ships get in making

him independent, two works, "The Political History of the

United States from the Organization of the Government down

to the War for the Union," and "The History of the Hayes

Administration." Meanwhile, he is working up the almost des-

perate struggle against Blaine's second nomination. He prefers

Sherman, and is very hopeful of victory for Sherman. But

failing that will take Sheridan, Harrison, Gresham, Hawley,

or "anybody" to beat Blaine. It still looks to a calm outsider

(to-wit your paternal) as if the Plumed Knight can get the

nomination if he wishes it, and as if his friends will find it









             <B>TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HENRY SMITH          359</B>



not difficult to persuade him that a second race is necessary

for his vindication. No doubt, Mr. Cleveland's free trade mes-

sage has brightened  Republican  prospects.        For  more  than

twenty years existing legislation has enticed capital and labor

into manufactures.     This is especially true of these last few

years. To strike them down now at a blow looks like cruelty

and bad faith. It will hardly be done. But something too much

of this. The paternal cannot expect this to be read without

yawning.

  I relieve your patience with good wishes to all at [the] Hast-

ings home.

                Affectionately, my dear "Sister,"

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Soncy, Bermuda.



  December  23.  Friday. -- We  met  at the Board  of Trade

room to begin subscriptions for the Lakeside and Islands Rail-

road at 2:30 P. M. Mr. White looked and spoke in a discour-

aging way. I think for some reason he is opposed to the en-

terprise. He showed the necessity for delay until after the

holidays. Finally it was understood that after the holidays work

would begin. He subscribed one thousand dollars. As the

largest property-owner in the town, he would get the largest

benefit from the growth of the town. If favorable to the proj-

ect he would have given at least three thousand dollars. If

he is against it, to raise the thirty-five thousand required is sim-

ply an impossibility. I hope we may somehow get it.

  December  25.  Sunday.  Christmas.--Clear; a thin veil of

snow only; lovely winter weather.

  Rev. Parker P. Pope preached two good sermons. Quiet;

no dancing around the pulpit, no low, whispered tones, no strain-

ing of the voice, no elaborate gestures; a natural, straightfor-

ward delivery of weighty matter. In the morning, Christ's love

for men; in the evening, all things changing but a longing for

stability and rest, which can only be gratified and supplied by

the Future of the Bible.

                         SPIEGEL GROVE, December 26, 1887.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I have just received from your son

Horace the beautiful sword and sash voted to you at the Ladies'

Catholic Orphans' Fair in Memphis, November 1864, and by

you now presented to the Birchard Library. This souvenir of

the appreciation of your administration as commander of the

district of Memphis in a time of difficulty and peril will be a

most acceptable and precious addition to the treasures of the

library, and your generous and thoughtful action will be an ex-

ample which will no doubt be often imitated. The sword will

be preserved with care and placed where it will remind all who

visit the library of your honorable record, both as a soldier in

the field and also as military governor of the important city of

Memphis.

  With admiration and friendship.

                          Sincerely,

                                  RUTHERFORD B. HAYES,

  GENERAL RALPH P. BUCKLAND,

    Fremont, Ohio.





  December 30. Friday.--We celebrated the thirty-fifth anni-

versary of our wedding by visiting Birchard and Mary on their

first anniversary of the like event. For us it should be and is

a happy day. Rarely occurs a happier union than ours. Fanny

is far away in the storm-vexed Bermudas or our felicity would

indeed be complete.

  December 31.  Saturday. -- First day's sleighing on the last

day of the year. Electric lights on the streets for the first time

tonight.





                        FREMONT, OHIO, December 31, 1887.

  DEAR SIR:--The facts you refer to are no doubt in the main

correct. The relic of the old Vermont home will go with sim-

parents had been five years in Ohio when I was born.

  With thanks.

                          Sincerely,

  MY DEAR FRIEND: -- The Comly tribute is in all respects ex-

cellent and will adorn the book.  We have a merry household of

young neyphews and nieces "(one [once] removed)," from Co-

lumbus spending with us the holidays. The boys with their can-

nons and the girls with their dolls are no more joyous than the

old folks.

  Mrs. Smith and Allie [Mrs. Charles Richard Williams] will

be more than welcome.  They must not postpone too long.  Our

days are waning.  We entered our thirty-sixth year of wedded

life yesterday! And you have done your share of work for

others.  Now is the time to work for your own pleasure and

fame, and at the same time for the instruction and happiness

of others.                 Sincerely,

        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 31, 1887.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your esteemed favor of

the 26th instant. The honor conferred by the invitation of the

Honorary Commissioners is, I assure you, highly appreciated.

With serious doubt of my ability to fitly discharge the duty

assigned to me, I am yet inclined to accept the invitation.  I

have other engagements  for the first week in October, and

for two or three days in each of the months of August and

September.  The two latter, I can probably fix at such dates as

I prefer. I will be glad to hear from you as to the probable

time of the "Ohio Day," and also as to any other addresses,

poems, or other literary work relating to the celebration. Of

course, originality and novelty are not to be expected, but it

often happens on such occasions that there is an excess of ora-

tory, history, and poetry which makes the closing or later ex-

cises too stale to be comfortable for those who are at the foot

of the program.

  On hearing from you again as to date, etc., etc., I will

promptly decide.

                          Sincerely,

  MY DARLING:--This is my first writing of 1888 and you

see I came near getting it 1887. So we all wish you and "you

all" a happy new year.

  Here a big snow fell Thursday night on roads frozen solid

and reasonably smooth. One day of sleighing, and then a warm

thaw Saturday. No snow this morning and now a clear freez-

ing day again! Even temperature you see.

  A happy week with John G. [Mitchell] Jr., Laura, Dorothy,

and Rutherford all here. The finest young folks in the world

-outside of Bermuda. . . .

  I send you no presents. Buy what you would like and call it

from Lucy and self. We are getting more and more tired of

life without you.

  We have had a jolly Sunday dinner.  Webb in his best spirits

and your mother in hers made it a lively and joyous time.

Your mother delighted the young people, all, for that matter,

all of us, with her stories told in her happiest way of Miss

Baskeval and her punishments, her teaching of manners, and

her gait. . . .

               Affectionately, your "paternal,"

             <B>THE HOLIDAYS 1887-1888          363</B>



                                   SPIEGEL, January 3, 1888.

   MY DEAR GUY:--Our holiday season has been a happy one,

and your letter added to the joy. With Laura's only son, John

Mitchell, and Fanny Fullerton's equally interesting young folks

viz., Laura, Dorothea, and Rutherford, our house was  full of

youthful cheerfulness and merriment from Christmas to New

Year's.

   Laura B--in Cleveland!  We will write to her and hope

she can make us a visit. I think I told you Fanny was spend-

ing the winter in Bermuda at Mrs. Hastings' island home.  We

are lacking young ladies in our household. The only drawback

here is the limited young society.  We and ours go to the cities

near us a great deal.

  How fast we are getting on! Birch has a son Rutherford.

Ruddy Platt has a son William A. Platt.

  I am quite busy with duties, correspondence, etc., etc., be-

nevolent, educational, and public. As long as my health con-

tinues good, this is probably best, but sometimes I am over-

worked. I shall be ready to go to my rest when my time comes,

be it never so soon.

  I hear of the illness of Mrs. Ballinger with sympathy and

deep regret.  I never fail to recall the delightful days on the

Brazos when she was such a vision of loveliness!

  We shall be ever so glad if you can contrive to spend a time

with us. We are always ready.

                          As ever,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.



  January 11, 1888.  Wednesday.--A  meeting  at  White's

office on the new railroad. Not of much public spirit. Haynes,

West, and Bush were decidedly favorable. Tillotson, against.

White not decided or hearty but rather friendly. I expect he

looks for and probably hopes for failure.

  January  12.  Thursday.--Received the report in five vol-

umes of the Royal Commissioners of Great Britain on technical









<B>364          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



instruction. Mr. William Mather's report on technical instruc-

tion in the United States is the part of this report which is

especially interesting to us. It contains much that is worthy of

quoting.

  January 13. Friday.--Another railroad meeting in White's

office. Another resolution to go ahead and raise what subscrip-

tions we can. Mr. Brannan still insists on twenty-five thousand

dollars, but we hope a less sum will bring it.

  January  14.  Saturday.--Accounts  from  the West  tell of

the severest storms since the prairie country was settled. Da-

kota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota all swept by blizzards.

Wind forty to fifty miles an hour, mercury 40 degrees or more

below zero, and blinding snow. Think of hunting for lost

school children--ten men holding to a hundred feet of rope

and sweeping in line in groups to find them!

  January 17.  Tuesday. -- [This]  afternoon I went over to

Toledo with the portraits I had obtained through Colonel

Nicholson of General Comly and to prepare for the memorial

I am to publish in his honor. The portraits were very satis-

factory to the family. I spent the afternoon with Mrs. Comly

and Susie looking over the scrapbooks and papers of the gen-

eral to select a few pieces showing his characteristics as a

writer. A little difficult to do it. His personality was so iden-

tified with his editorial work that no editorial or other essay

seems quite equal to what we have been accustomed to see

from his pen.

  January  19.  Thursday.--Last  evening General  and Mrs.

Buckland  celebrated their golden  wedding.      Mrs.  Buckland

whose mind has been clouded for some years seemed more nat-

ural and cheerful than I have seen her for a long time. In-

deed, she was almost herself again and enjoyed and appreciated

the occasion. The guests, about twenty-five, were the "old set-

tlers," as a rule. . . . All passed off unexpectedly well.

  January 20.--Last evening presided over the campfire of

Manville Moore Post in the city hall. Captain E. M. Colver

made the address. A good account and eulogium on the cavalry









             <B>PARAGRAPHS OF PRACTICAL WISDOM          365</B>



of the war. The star event was the fight between Wade Hamp-

ton and "Little Kil" [Kilpatrick] near the close of the war in

Carolina.

  January  21.  Saturday.--Two  degrees  below  zero!          The

most terrible reports of death and suffering at the West. Noth-

ing equal to it in the settlement of the country.

  January  26.  Thursday.--Tuesday  to Cleveland  to attend

the inauguration of Dr. Haydn as President of Adelbert. After

hearing him, [the board] passed resolutions that he wished,

returning to the old idea of boys and young men alone. The

special situation at Cleveland and the endowment of Adelbert

fully justified the action taken by the trustees in my judgment.

In common all friends of the old college and of the Western

Reserve University have great reason to rejoice that the institu-

tion has secured as its head a man of distinguished talents, en-

thusiasm, and devotion to any work he undertakes. Under

the presidency of the Rev. Dr. Haydn, we may confidently

hope that the institution will be greatly prospered.

  As to the delivery of the keys and the address which is ex-

pected in connection with that ceremony, it gave me an oppor-

tunity to practice what I habitually try to teach, viz., that all

programs for such occasions are apt to be too long and should

be cut down from one-third to one-half. Surely the audience

after listening to Dr. Haydn did not want more speaking.





               THOUGHTS ON VARIOUS TOPICS.<B>*</B>

  There is one sure way of attaining happiness, it is this: A

sincere and unrelaxing activity for the happiness of others.



  Revolutions and "bolts" are alike. They are sacred when the

facts justify them.  When  not so justified they are blunders

of the sort that is worse than crime!



  The happiness of the home, of old age, of middle life as well

 how largely does it depend on the young of the household!

<B>366          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



If they are worthless, what misery! If they are full of prom-

ise, what serene joy!



  Give the young wide diversity of education. There are tal-

ents buried in every neighborhood.



  The end and object of manual training is to make our young

people able and willing to work with their hands; to give them

habits of labor, -- willing to put on their old clothes and work --

not merely willing to work but enjoying work.



  Among the essential advantages of all industrial training,

on the farm or in the shop, these two are the chief: It forms

habits of labor; it gives skill and knowledge in labor.  Now, for

the farmer's boy or girl these are secured at the college and the

special skill of the farmer is continued and extended in the va-

cations of two or more months.



  On what ground do free schools stand? Our government rests

on the intelligence and virtue of the people. Without free

schools we cannot have intelligence and virtue.



  On the one hand, Europe sends us labor, ignorant and de-

graded.  On the other, it sends faith in money.  Money is might

and might makes right.  The remedy is, mix brains with labor.

Intelligent labor is safe, is conservative, is virtuous.



  The average professional man is apt to be the last to accept

any reform appertaining to his profession. "What is, is per-

fect." But in this case the professional scholars of best repute,

both as instructors and as examples of the higher education,

are friends of the reform.--President Gilman of Johns Hop-

kins, President Payne of Wesleyan University, at Delaware,

President Scott of Ohio State University, etc.



  The new education does no harm. It means physical health,

steady nerves, the ability to sleep when sleep is needed. While









             <B>PARAGRAPHS OF PRACTICAL WISDOM          367</B>



to neglect the new education, to do without bodily exercise,

means the opposite of all of these things.



  You give your boy over to laziness, give him an easy time,

and you will make a monkey of him. Give him habits of in-

dustry, give him a hard time, and you will make a man of him.



  Vast accumulations of wealth in a few hands are hostile to

labor. Their tendency is to break down fair competition, to

build up monopoly, to corrupt politics, to bribe conventions,

legislative bodies, courts and juries, to debauch society; and

[even] churches are not beyond the reach of their baneful in-

fluence.



                                 SPIEGEL, January 27, 1888.

  MY DARLING:--After leaving you I went to the [Toledo]

Commercial office [and] had a long confidential talk with Mr.

Pelton, the business partner of the Comlys. It was interesting

and on the whole encouraging for the family. Called on Mrs.

Comly. She was out on a visit. Susie, Guy, and Smith dined

me agreeably. A fine and interesting family.

  Got to the train just in time.  Failed to see Birchard.       At

home found the enclosed from Webb. His direction in this

instance, you will decide as you prefer. Perhaps it is best to

obey.  But whatever you do will be "discreetest, wisest, best."

        All well at home.

                         Affectionately,

  MRS. HAYES,                                     RUTHERFORD.

     Cincinnati.



   January  29.  Sunday.-Began  preparations  to speak off-

hand at Jefferson to the farmers. Two points I must repeat and

emphasize:    I.  The value of instruction in all skilled labor.

2. The importance of the Ohio State University as a normal

school in skilled labor and natural science.  We  must  have

teachers specially prepared to teach the sciences pertaining to

agriculture.

                               SPIEGEL, January 29, 1888.

  MY DARLING:--Your mother left for Cincinnati Friday in

excellent  health and  spirits.  Indeed  this lovely winter has

seemed to build her up in all ways.

  We have had none of the storms that have been so severe

both West and East.      We now have excellent sleighing and

bright weather. We are apprehensive that when the snow goes

off we may have floods again.

  Mary and Rud gave a young folks' party of about fifty or

sixty that was very successful. You will notice by the cutting

from the News a good many new names.  Many of them are

a valuable addition to our society. They are the newcomers

in the recent manufactures, which natural gas has brought in.

  Rud has at last, I think, a pretty good picture of your

nephew. I hope he can print some in time for this mail.

  You still say nothing of returning home. I fear such ex-

cessive gaiety. Do not stay so long, nor keep the floor so many

times at the dances.  It is not well in any respect. . . .

                   Lovingly, your father,

                                  RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Soncy, Bermuda.

                       FREMONT, OHIO, January 31, 1888.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Your article on Mr. Horton is so ex-

cellent that I can't wait until I have time to write a letter be-

fore telling you of the gratification it gives me. He was a

noble genleman, and you have nobly portrayed him.

  How fine the photograph of Horton is. Thanks, thanks.--

Kindest regards to the boy and his mother.

                         Sincerely,

                                  RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

    Cincinnati.

                        FREMONT, OHIO, February 7, 1888.

  MY DEAR SIR:--By reason of absence from home, I have

only just received your esteemed favor informing me of the









             <B>FREMONT METHODIST CHURCH BURNED          369</B>



invitation for February 22d with which the [Ohio] House of

Representatives has honored me. I beg you to receive my thanks

for your kind note, and to assure you of the pleasure it will

give me to attend the meeting of the 22d, and confer with all

who are interested in manual training as part of our educa-

tional system in school and college.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  [Unidentified.]



  February 8.  Wednesday.--A long list of interesting events

since the first.

  1. Thursday, 2d, with Lucy made a five days' visit to Mr. and

Mrs. D. Z. Norton, Cleveland.  A finer visit never made.

  2. Friday to Jefferson--at Mr. H. Talcott's to dinner. After-

noon spoke almost two hours to the Ashtabula County Farm-

ers' Institute. Evening, hand-shaking and a little talk in the

rink to the G. A. R. and an entertainment at the Giddings

Post; ladies and comrades. A call on Mrs. Wade, and spent

the evening and night with Hon. ---- Howland, Mrs. Howland,

and son. Exceedingly pleasant.

  3.  Sunday, called on Captain Kendall and heard the scan-

dalous story which touches nearly the Loyal Legion; agreed to

meet General Leggett and General Barnett to deal with it. An-

other happy day with our attractive friends the Nortons and their

circle.

  4. Monday, 12 M., met General Leggett and General Barnett

at General Leggett's office and heard General Voris' story. All

agreed [on] a letter written [and] entrusted to me which it is

hoped will prevent publicity of the affair.

  [At] 3:35 P. M., started home. Soon were informed by

Judge Lemmon that our elegant little church at home was afire!

Hoped the report was untrue. But as we approached home the

details were against hopes. Our church burned completely!

  Met that evening in Finefrock's office and resolved to re-

build at once; to take up subscriptions. The old building com-

mittee to act again, viz., June, Bristol, Stierwalt, Dudrow, Sieg-

fried, -----, and myself.

    24









<B>370          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Tuesday, [the] 7th, began to circulate subscription. Dick

Tobin, Irish Catholic drayman, paid over the first cash--one

dollar.

  February 9.--Our  pastor, J. Stierwalt, and myself had a

meeting to talk over plans for rebuilding our burned church

last evening. We agree that the unburned walls etc., are worth

for the new building five thousand dollars. Insurance expected

on building, ten thousand dollars. We should have to pay in

full not less than seven thousand dollars -- [a total of] twenty-

two thousand dollars.  We considered some changes. . . .

[But decided] the audience room and general appearance to re-

main nearly or exactly as before.

  February 10.--Spent the day in Toledo.  Dined with Mrs.,

Guy, Stewart, and Susie Comly. Finished for the printer the

memorial to the general.  Found Mr. Bristol at the depot [on my

return].  The adjusters want something--that is, to shirk their

liability or to haggle about the amount of the [church] losses.

They can't afford to adhere to such a course.

  Poor Hoadly! At the dinner on Tilden's birthday he spoke

of me as "the usurper." He can't get that awful snub of the

Electoral Commission, "Aye, none, Nay, 15," on his Oregon ras-

cality, out of his memory.

  February 11.--The church affairs still occupy our time.  The

insurance men today allowed the full amount of the policies--

ten thousand dollars on building, one thousand dollars on organ,

and five hundred dollars on parsonage.

  February  12.  Sunday.--The  Presbyterians having offered

to share their church with us, we (Methodists) united with them

and filled their large church with a great congregation. Mr.

Barnes preached a very notable sermon on the Divinity of

Christ. Mr. and Mrs. Bristol and their youngest daughter spent

a cheerful hour with us.



                                SPIEGEL, February 12, 1888.

  MY DARLING:--The event of the week is the burning of our

beautiful little church Monday, 6th of February, soon after









             <B>FREMONT METHODIST CHURCH BURNED          371</B>



noon. We were on our way from Cleveland in the cars when

we heard of it. The preacher's family, we found in our house

when we reached home. The parsonage wrecked by the church

wall falling on it. Hannah Day was upstairs in the parsonage

and was driven through two floors into the cellar and bricks,

etc., four or six feet piled on her.  Not seriously hurt! We re-

build at once, but it has been a busy time for Lucy. Of course

I am also "in the suds."

  When you return Lucy will meet you in New York. Per-

haps I will accompany her. Do not push things about a return.

Make the time agreeable to our friends.  We are hungry to

see you, but can wait until the suitable time.

  The boy improves, as you will see by the latest photo. -- With

ever so much love.

                         Sincerely,

                                   RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Soncy, Bermuda.



  February 13.  Monday.--At night in the rink, attending the

"carnival" of the Catholics of St. Joseph's Church, Rev. S.

Bauer. A great crowd of happy people--handsomely handled

by Father Bauer. I made a short speech in response to the

toast, "The Glorious American Principle of Religious Liberty

and Equality,"  It was well received.  The whole affair was

successful. Dr. John Rice made a philosophical and humor-

ous speech on the German element of our population. Only

one fault, the common fault--"too long." I suggest shorten-

ing the programme fifty per cent in all cases.  Fix a time to ad-

journ--not later than eleven--and push things.  Work up to

it.



                               SPIEGEL, February 19, 1888.

  MY DARLING:--Our cousins Ed Cook and Nellie are with

us. Lucy and I go with them tomorrow morning as far as Co-

lumbus to visit Laura, Fanny, and the rest. I will preach on

my hobby to the Legislature--viz., on industrial education.









<B>372          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Birch and Mary with the boy, after spending with us more

than a month, have returned to their own home. The boy grows

and gains in all ways. . . .

  Our Presbyterian friends receive us with good feeling and the

two congregations fill the large church gloriously.

  We start at 9 A. M. tomorrow. Some packing, and our

cousins may stop this letter here. If so we all love you dearly

and long for your return.

               Ever affectionately, your father,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Soncy, Bermuda.



  February 26.--On the 20th with Lucy via Toledo to Colum-

bus. A happy visit, very. On the unanimous invitation of the

House of Representatives, [I] addressed them the evening of

the 22nd on industrial education. Satisfactory. Indeed it was

received with enthusiasm. Dined with Charles Dudley War-

ner at Laura's. One of Lucy's best times at Columbus. [On

the] 24th, Friday, returned to Toledo. Spent the night at

Birchard's.  The new house is made home--beautiful home--

by the furnishing, carpets, papering, etc., etc. Mary, as always,

delightful.

  At Columbus found the boom over after a few weeks of

rush. Prices up to present conditions the result.





              SPIEGEL, Monday Morning, February 27, 1888.

  MY DARLING:--At this moment the mercury is just above

zero--two degrees.  Clear and beautiful morning.          We  begin

to look for winter to wind up with a feeling that we have had

enough. Last week there were a few days warm enough. We

talked of spring! . . .

  I go to Cleveland to stir up the Methodist alumni of the col-

lege at Delaware on the subject of work--a department of

work in the university. We are still you see busy at semipub-

lic work.









             <B>INDUSTRIAL TRAINING AT DELAWARE          373</B>



  We hope to meet you in New York when you return, and

escort you home. You do not yet indicate the day. When the

spring weather was down upon us we thought strongly of or-

dering the young lady home. But this frozen term closes our

mouths. We love you all the same. And shall not be up to the

full mark of happiness we are entitled to until we hear your

voice ringing through the house. Spiegel misses you!

  Your mother says she loves you very much and is getting

very homesick for you. "Besides, doesn't Cousin Emily feel

like starting" you?

         With all love.--Your affectionate paternal,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Soncy, Bermuda.



  March 1.  Thursday. -- I returned from Cleveland last eve-

ning. While there the 28th, Tuesday, I spoke at a meeting of

alumni of Wesleyan University in favor of manual training.

A  select audience.  Professor Whitlock also spoke.  He  was

convincing and conservative.     My  broken remarks of thirty

minutes were well received. We will begin the experiment with

printing.

  March 2. -- The ladies' supper for funds to rebuild our church

was a big success. Lucy busy about it for some days.

  Besides feasting perhaps two hundred to three hundred citi-

zens at thirty-five cents each, they gave a supper to the I. O. O.

F. by McPherson Lodge. About fifty guests from Elyria and

elsewhere. A notable time, indeed. The three degrees and

initiation were given in capital style--the new team-work be-

ing used. A great fondness for dramatic work is one of the

deep-seated desires of the heart. It was done last night in good

taste, and with much genuine pathos.

  March 3.  Saturday.--I received a letter from N. E. Gray,

the ex-convict of Philadelphia, warmly thanking me for the

twenty-five dollars I sent him for the article on the Eastern

Penitentiary of Pennsylvania, which I had published by F. H.









<B>374          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Wines in the International Record of Charities and Correction.

Very gratifying.

  March 8. Thursday.--Yesterday I was at the meeting of

the board of Western Reserve University.  We  added a musi-

cal department to the institution. The gymnasium does not

walk off as it should. President Haydn does not, I suspect,

estimate at their worth the academies. Fifteen hundred dollars

is subsidy enough for the Green Spring Academy, but it is not

too much. It is money as well spent as any that the Adelbert

[College] appropriates.

  March 9. Friday. -- Finished a short talk for the Press Club

at Toledo. A cherful view of the newspapers as a whole with-

out flattery.  Merely a sensible talk.  The brevity and a spirited

reading will carry it off; a quiet statement that the newspapers

with all their faults are useful and important.

  March 10.--The death of [the] Emperor of Germany at a

great age is the fact of the week. His heir, dying with cancer,

comes in as Frederick III.

  March 11.  Sunday.--Mayor Hewitt, of New York, is com-

plimented by the newspapers for brave words spoken on the

labor question. They are all in criticism of the Labor men.

Some obvious blunders of the leaders and mistakes in methods

are easily pointed out. But there is no bravery in it, and I sus-

pect not much wisdom. The real difficulty is with the vast

wealth and power in the hands of the few and the unscrupulous

who represent or control capital.  Hundreds of laws of Con-

gress and the state legislatures are in the interest of these men

and against the interests of the workingmen. These need to be

exposed and repealed. All laws on corporations, on taxation,

on trusts, wills, descent, and the like, need examination and

extensive change. This is a government of the people, by the

people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of

corporations, by corporations, and for corporations. -- How is

this?

  March 12.  Monday. -- Fifty-one years ago, a morning like

this, but the snow was perhaps ten or twelve inches deep, I

started in a sleigh, the stage on runners, Mr. Hinton, the great









             <B>LABOR AND CAPITAL PROBLEM          375</B>



stage man of that day, in charge. Some eight or ten passengers

Reached Marion at dark. Passengers, tired, wanted to stop.

It was the regular stopping-place. Hinton saw that the south

wind was blowing and that soon the snow would melt leaving

us on bare ground. No wheels at Marion; must get on to Dela-

ware where he would find a coach on wheels. He said to the

landlord privately: "Give these people your best supper and

good strong coffee.  I can manage them  after they are well

fed." After supper all felt in good spirits. Hinton pleasantly

told them the situation. He said: "I can carry you on in the

morning on wheels, but it will be in uncomfortable road wagons.

It will be more comfortable to go on tonight." All changed

their minds.  We  reached Delaware after midnight with the

snow melting fast. When I awoke in the morning the sun was

shining brightly and there was not a particle of snow in sight.

  March 13.  Tuesday. -- The greatest storm, snow and wind, in

New York for thirty years or more [the historic blizzard] was

Sunday night and yesterday.



                          FREMONT, OHIO, March 13, 1888.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I wrote you on the back of one of Judge

Lemmon's statements touching the toll-gates on the pike -- that

there was a general sentiment in favor of abolishing them. This

might be misleading. Indeed, I was myself mistaken as to the

extent to the opposition. I am in favor of the measure but I

find more opposed to it than I supposed. I therefore write to

request that you will not use my letter with other senators, or

allow it to be published.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE J. ZIMMERMAN,

    Columbus.



  March 15. Thursday.--We had a pleasant time at the [To-

ledo] Press Club entertainment [last night].  My  speech was

well enough, perhaps even better than that. It was an attempt

to deal fairly with the newspapers; to recognize their value and,









<B>376          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



without denying their shortcomings, to give them due credit as

part of our system of education and government.

  March  16.--I am to respond to the sentiment, "The Irish

and the War for the Union," at the St. Patrick's festival, 17th

of this month--tomorrow  night.  Only a few  words.  The

attitude of Ireland towards America in the war, and Irishmen

as soldiers in the Union army. All governments were against

us.  We  were alone.     No  aid, no  sympathy, but a constant

peril. A deceptive and malicious neutrality, or a dangerous and

hostile intervention.

  March 17.  Saturday.--The unexampled storm of wind and

snow that swept over the States from Washington to Portland,

Maine, and perhaps beyond, involving all of Pennsylvania, New

Jersey, New York, and New England, is the event of the week.

  The St. Patrick's celebration by St. Ann's congregation was

excellent. A neat, good supper and good music, singing, reci-

tations, and speeches.  We left at 10 P. M.  I told stories of the

little Irishman of the Twenty-third.

  MY  DARLING: -- . . . The weather here is and has been

superb--bright days are the rule.  The gusty storms West and

East do not reach us. We leave the matter [the time of your

return] however entirely to you. Your mother says: "Bring a

large store of patience and cheerfulness" to bear with us all.

  I am going to set you going in "manual training." That more

than ever is our pet hobby. Your mother and I enjoyed greatly

the Press Club entertainment at Toledo Thursday evening in

the opera house. The star feature of the occasion were tab-

leaux and exercises of the boys and girls of the Training School.

You see what you are coming to. The desire of my heart is

that you take this training in hand and become a "burning and

a shining" example of "M. T." . . .

  Give Emily and the general our warmest regards.

                       Affectionately,

  MISS FANNY HAYES,                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES

             <B>GENERAL CROOK'S PROMOTION          377</B>



                          FREMONT, OHIO, March 20, 1888.

  MY  DEAR SIR:--  . . . Our friend General Crook is, I

am sure, the man to take the place of General Terry, if the lat-

ter retires as is now expected early in April.

  I believe General Crook is the senior brigadier. His appoint-

ment will be especially gratifying to all who take an interest in

just and humane treatment of the Indian.

  His attitude to Mr. Cleveland's Administration is not in his

way, and he is the most distinguished soldier named for the

place.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  THE CHIEF JUSTICE,

    Washington.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 20, 1888.

  MY DEAR FRIEND: -- Can you do anything to help our friend

General George Crook? General Terry it is expected will re-

tire in a few weeks. If so the vacancy should be filled by the

best man. We know Crook as the brave and successful Indian

fighter of his time and what is better, as the true, judicious,

and reliable friend of the Indian. He is, I believe, the senior

brigadier and although no politician, he is a friend of Mr.

Cleveland's Administration.  If you have any opportunity to

aid in bringing the facts to the President's attention, it will, I

hope, aid one of the best and most deserving officers in our

army.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ,

    New York.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 21, 1888.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- In reply to your favor of the 20th:--

  1. The most important amendment to the National Consti-

tution, in my opinion, is to fix the Presidential term at six years,

and no eligibility for a second term.

  2. Universal education by state authority where practicable,









<B>378          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and supplemented by National aid where needed. Compared

with this, money spent for fortifications and navy is wasted.

  3. Industrial training to be part of the education of all the

young, of both sexes, and of all conditions.

  4. Believing that the existing capital and labor troubles are

mainly due to the irresponsible power of wealth on one hand,

and of numbers on the other, the aim of reform should be to

bring both equally under the control of laws for the general

good.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  J. M. STURTEVANT.





  March 22, 1888.--On the way over [to Toledo this morning,

I] read in the Detroit Free Press that the city council and

school board of Detroit would visit this morning the Manual

Training School of Toledo with a view to introducing the sys-

tem into the schools of that city. [I] decided to go to the school

and assist in their reception. At the school met Mr. Miller, Mr.

Macomber, Mr. Marx, and Mr. Scott who requested me to re-

main, to speak, etc., etc.  After visiting all parts of the school,

viz., drawing rooms, cooking, millinery, wood-carving, and

other rooms of the young women, the carpenter, turning, black-

smith, etc., shops, the party assembled in the hall. I spoke in

behalf of the new education, acceptably, and Mr. Macomber,

one of the directors of the school, took the floor and in a con-

versational way gave a very intelligent and valuable account of

the school with full details. The building cost a trifle less than

forty thousand dollars; tools, engines, and equipment almost

twenty thousand dollars; yearly cost nine thousand dollars (a

little less). A satisfactory meeting.

  Some opposition by Knights of Labor in Detroit. I said:

"If I did not [think] that industrial education was in the inter-

est of the workingman, I would lose my interest in it."

  In the afternoon I went to Tontogany. Was the guest of

Samuel L. Irving, wife, two daughters and one son, a child of

four.  Meeting of the G. A. R. in the Presbyterian Church.









             <B>LABOR AND CAPITAL PROBLEM          379</B>

Snow deep, roads almost impassable from frozen mud and snow;

audience not large. Five of my old soldiers present. A half

dozen more who were in the Valley Campaign of Sheridan.

Told the story well enough, and could see that the audience

were pleased and enjoyed the talk to the end, one hour and

thirty minutes!
