  JUNE 23, 1876.--The  nomination  has  been  well received.

The best people, many of them heretofore dissatisfied with

the Republican party, are especially hearty in my support. I must

make it my constant effort to deserve this confidence.





                                  COLUMBUS, June 23, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am very glad to get your good full letter.<B>*</B>

The next thing in order for me is my Letter of Acceptance. I

am advised to harden by some, and to soften by others, the money

plank, and so on. Perhaps I would do well to approve it as it

stands. I shall hardly reply to the committee before the end

of the month, or till after the Fourth.  If you have suggestions

you will oblige me by making them.  My  inclination is to say

very little. The people are already organizing meetings, are

ratifying, and the Letter of Acceptance may as well perhaps be

a purely formal affair, may it not?

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



Confidential.

                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, June 27, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I am very glad to get your letters of the 20th

and 23rd. I will give your suggestions my best consideration.

  I do not expect to write my Acceptance for ten days or two

weeks.  In the meantime I wish to give you with entire frank-

ness how the matter lies in my mind now, hoping to hear from

you again before I write for the public. I wish to remain entire-

ly uncommitted until the time for issuing the Letter.

  I now think as you do--probably precisely as you do--on

the civil service reform part of our platform. I want to make

that the issue of the canvass--to be perfectly explicit, decided,

and square, but brief in regard to it.  I will, therefore, be glad

to have your views in form, or to be referred to the document

(speech or letter) which gives the best statement of the true

thing.

  I do not expect to say anything on the specie resumption plank.

I am so pronounced and well known on that question that I feel

like saying, that the man who wants other interpretation of our

platform than the fact of my candidacy, is pretty likely to vote

against me even if he has to support Governor Allen or General

Cary.

  I now feel like saying something as to the South, not essen-

tially different from your suggestions, but am not decided about

it. I don't like the phrase, by reason of its Democratic associa-

tions, which you use--"local self-government"--in that con-

nection.  It seems to me to smack of the bowie-knife and re-

volver.  "Local  self-government"  has nullified the Fifteenth

Amendment in several States, and is in a fair way to nullify the

Fourteenth and Thirteenth.  But I do favor a policy of recon-

ciliation, based on the observance of all parts of the Constitution

--the new as well as the old -- and, therefore, suppose you and

I are substantially agreed on the topic.

  One other suggestion, let me now submit to you:  I really

think that a President could do more good in one term if un-

trammelled by the belief that he was fixing things for his election

to a second term, than with the best intentions could be done

in two terms with his power embarrassed by that suspicion or

temptation  during his first four years.     Our  platform  says

nothing on the subject. I am averse to adding topics, but could

I not properly avow my own view and purpose on this head?

  And now you will excuse me for writing so hurriedly and in-

considerately. I returned late last night from my home at Fre-

mont. I am thronged with callers, and in the midst of a shower

of letters and dispatches. Whether you can support me or not,









<B>330          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



you will treat this as confidential, and, I hope, let me hear from

you further.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE CARL SCHURZ.





  [Mr. Schurz replied as follows:

                          ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, July 5, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Your kind letter of June 27 has been for-

warded to me. I can only thank you for the confidential frank-

ness with which you speak to me and may assure you that this

confidence is not misplaced. I am exceedingly glad to know

that your views on civil service reform agree so well with those

I ventured to submit, and that you desire to make that reform

"the issue of the canvass." In compliance with the desire you

expressed at our interview last Saturday, I submit the following

draft of a paragraph for your letter of acceptance: . . .

  This paragraph may at first sight appear somewhat longer

than you desire to have it, but the subject is of such paramount

importance, and it is so necessary to show a clear and complete

understanding of the question and to avoid the least appearance

of equivocation, that, as I think, not a single point should be

sacrificed to the charm of brevity. Its fearless straightforward-

ness and completeness will undoubtedly with great effect appeal

to the best impulses of the popular heart.  To fight for such a

programme would, even in case of defeat, be glorious enough.

But to succeed with it in the election, as I trust you will, and

then faithfully to carry out such a reform, will place him who

does it, in the first rank of the best names in American history.

  You ask me about the propriety of introducing the one-term

principle. My impression is that it might appear well at the

close of the above paragraph and with direct reference to it. It

would be calculated to strengthen the earnestness of the reform

pledge.

  Now another matter. You say you do not deem it necessary

to refer to the currency question again. There I venture to dif-









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          331</B>



fer with you. The equivocal position in which the Democrats

have placed themselves by demanding the repeal of the resumption

clause, furnishes us one of our main weapons of attack. I have

already assailed that point in my paper. But neither is the

Republican platform clear enough in that respect. It is indeed

important that you should strengthen our position. Permit me

to propose to you the following paragraph:--

  "On the currency question I have frequently expressed my

views in public and stand by my record. I regard every law

of the United States concerning the payment of any form of our

public indebtedness, the legal-tenders included, as constituting

a pledge and moral obligation of the Government which must in

good faith be adhered to. Moreover I am convinced, that the

feeling of uncertainty inseparable from the existence of an ir-

redeemable paper currency with its incidental fluctuations of

values and the restless agitation it causes, is one of the greatest

obstacles standing in the way of a revival of business confidence

and the return of prosperity. That uncertainty can be put an end

to only in one way: by the resumption of specie payments, re-

storing to the business of the country a safe basis; and the sooner

this is accomplished the greater will be the benefit to all our

economical interests and all classes of society."

  This, I think, would place you on unassailable ground and

give us a great advantage of position, especially in the State

of New York.  It may appear again a little long, but I would

ask you to consider that never in American history was there

a letter of acceptance written of such exceeding importance,

and for which the people looked with so much anxious interest.



  Believe me, dear sir, very truly yours,

                                                  C. SCHURZ.

  GOVERNOR R. B. HAYES.



  The suggested paragraph on the civil service is omitted from

the foregoing letter, as Mr. Hayes used no part of it, though it

may have helped to clarify his thought. He was influenced by

what Mr. Schurz wrote in regard to the currency question, and

he used the substance of the paragraph submitted by Mr.









<B>332          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Schurz, modifying the phraseology, however, in the interest of

simplicity and terseness.]



                                  COLUMBUS, June 27, 1876.

  MY DEAR MRS. DAVIS:--I do appreciate your letter, your eye

of faith, and yourself and the doctor. I can't write much, as

you know.  Returning late last night from Fremont (where I

left Lucy for a day longer and Fanny for a fortnight) I found

your letters with others.

  We are steady and cool and even, as yet. I think we shall

remain so.  But you are perfectly right.  I am also grateful

that we are old enough to see through it all -- to know that we

are publicans and sinners--and that all this is fleeting. We

shall try to do well and thus repay you, as far as, and in the

only way that payment is possible.

  Our love to Lida. If she wrote of somebody else I would

gush.--I will surely send the photos.

                          As ever,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. ELIZA G. DAVIS,

      Cincinnati.

                           COLUMBUS, OHIO, June 30, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am exceedingly obliged for your letter. I

think so well of your judgment that I am desirous to hear again.

In view of St. Louis, my own judgment is in favor of a short

but decisive statement on currency, schools, and civil service.

  I gratefully appreciate what you have done.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

      Cincinnati.

                                 COLUMBUS, June 30, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Thanks for your letter of the 27th [giving

advice as to the formation of the national committee and ex-

pressing confidence in Republican success]. I will show it to

General Wikoff.   Without much acquaintance with the work









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          333</B>



of the National Committee, I appreciate its importance and am

particularly anxious that in this there shall be nothing to dis-

turb the existing harmony.  All interests should be fairly re-

garded and an efficient committee organized. The contest will

be severe and critical.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE  W. E. CHANDLER,

      Washington.



  July 8. -- The nomination of Tilden makes doubtful the States

of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. I have prepared a

bold and honest Letter of Acceptance. It will offend some and

cool the ardor of others, but it is sound and I believe will be

strong with the people.  At any rate, it is the true course.

  Our adversaries reckon on a united South.  This is their hope.

We must meet them on this.  They are under the same leader-

ship which for fifteen years has been on the wrong side of every

question.



                                    COLUMBUS, July 8, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--My Letter is ready and will, I hope, be

satisfactory to you. Now for the campaign. Can't you get your

Congressional Campaign Committee to go actively to work? If

you will go to North Carolina you can do great good.  Look into

that State and see what can be done.  No time is to be lost.

I wish you would prepare a speech or an important part of a

speech on the school question.  It is important that what has been

done or attempted in New York City should be fully exhibited.

Our regards to Mrs. Garfield.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE J. A. GARFIELD.



                             COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 14, 1876.

  MY DEAR JUDGE: -- I am glad you like the Letter.  Perhaps I

am oversanguine.    But it strikes me that if elected, with the









<B>334          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



party fully committed to the reform, it will not be so difficult to

put it into practice as the objectors profess to believe. At any

rate it must have a fair trial, and my belief is it can be done

without half the friction, even at first, that belongs, of necessity,

to existing methods.

  I shall be interested in the judge's [Johnston's] speech. Too

laudatory, of course.  No man ever was a tithe of what a favor-

ite candidate is painted by his friends.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE W. M. DICKSON,

      Cincinnati.

                                    COLUMBUS, July 14, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I learned from Mr. Platt, of New York,

in a recent conversation with him here, that at least one person

has misconstrued the paragraph in my Letter of Acceptance as

to a second term as a reflection on you. Nothing, I assure you,

is further from the fact.

  In addition to the reason given in the letter, there was another

which had much weight with me. I was not a prominent can-

didate outside of my own State. There were at least four gentle-

men who in this respect were in advance of me. The five lead-

ing candidates are all younger men than I am. Four years

hence, I think, they will all be younger than I am now. At any

rate, they may all reasonably expect to be candidates in future

if they desire to be. It seemed to me therefore that nominated

as I was, it would tend to unite and harmonize their friends

if it were certainly known that I would not be in their way four

years from now. If elected, it will surely strengthen my Ad-

ministration.

  I need hardly assure you that I would not say anything to re-

flect on you, but under the circumstances this much seems proper.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

                             COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 24, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I think the assessment business will not be

pushed by our committee. Beyond that I do not see how I can

act efficiently. We can (and are doing it) commit the party to

the right doctrines by resolutions of clubs, meetings, and the like,

until there will be left no basis for the objectors. But I suspect

the main thing is to be like flint when action is had. A good de-

gree of stubbornness at the start, I have great faith in. I read

the articles in the Nation. The trouble is not, it seems to me,

the real intrinsic difficulty of doing the right thing, but it has

been that those whose duty it was to act didn't believe in or care

for the work. On a small scale, I have tried it. It was curious

to see the horror of friends when I announced quietly that I

meant to appoint at least one Democrat on every state board. But

the thing, once done, soon became easy and a matter of course.

  Just now our Tilden people seem hereabouts to be drooping.

Their currency muddle, Hendricks, etc., etc., disturb them. I

really don't see what their worry means, but that there is a worry

is plain enough.

  Don't work too hard until this torrid weather leaves us. I

inherit a Presbyterian fatalism. We shall get through, if we are

to do it.             With sincere regard,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am obliged for your letter as to the [Chi-

cago] Inter Ocean, and the caution you suggest. Unfortunately

I am "land-poor," and in no condition to give the sort of aid

required.

  Our Democratic friends are losing spirit rapidly. But we must

manage not to let them drive off all our Southern strength. Your

debate in the Senate helped. It is eagerly read and is the talk

of the people.              Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

from other reliable sources. I suspect that through Dr. Daven-

  Just now there is an apparent drooping in the Tilden camp.

It is probably only temporary -- due to the difficulty on currency.

                             COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 25, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am glad you endorse the Letter.  It seemed

to me that its doctrines would, if need be, stand defeat. I have

long since got over all tendency to panic because of Democratic

professions of confidence. They study it as an art. It is also

a test of orthodoxy. A Democrat loses caste with his fellows

if he does not brag on the prospects. -- Thank you for the letter,

and the good things you are doing.

what you state about them. Accept my thanks for your attention

in this matter.

the effect of your attempting to explain Mr. Wheeler's course

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--A slander has been started in West Vir-

ginia which you may be able to aid in putting down.  It is said

that I appropriated to my own use the money (about three hun-

dred dollars or four hundred dollars) found on the deserter who

was shot at Monocacy the first week in August, 1864.  You re-

member the case no doubt.  He was a Rebel deserter; joined

Company D, Twenty-third; deserted to the Rebels; was taken

prisoner at Cloyd's Mountain; escaped; became a bounty-jumper,

and was sent to [the] Twenty-third (Ohio) at Monocacy early in

August, 1864; tried as a deserter and executed. The money he

had was received for bounties, and it was decided to take it and

use it to get a man in his place. This was no doubt done. Cer-

tainly, I didn't use the money.  Tell me all you remember about

it and oblige,

                          Sincerely,

  [Similar letters were written to General H. F. Devol, General

Russell Hastings, and to Colonel William R. Brown.  To the

letter, which is recorded in the Diary, Mr. Hayes appended this

comment: -- "The foregoing letter shows the sort of falsehoods

which the partisan press gathers up or fabricates.  They are

not believed, however, and do not worry me a great deal."]

  MY DEAR S--:--I have your favor of the 29th. I can't help

thinking that you overestimate the effect of the testimony at

Washington. It is, of course, noticed by the people, but I sus-

pect we are getting slowly into a current which will not be much

influenced by what is done hereafter at Washington.

  I have a good letter from Judge Taft [Secretary of War]. He

gives an encouraging account of the feeling and purposes of those

around him. There seems to be the best of feeling in that

quarter. -- Thanks.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- Our campaign is in good condition and

I agree with Mr. Perry that it is not best to make much of the

topic he alludes to.  Why allude to it at all?  I send you Mr.

Perry's letter which please return. Let me again call your at-

tention to Blaine's proposed Constitutional Amendment to pro-

tect the schools. A few paragraphs on the Democratic treat-

ment of it, its importance, etc., etc., ought to be in every speech.

Talk to our Southern friends about it. My correspondence from

the South indicates that it may be of value there also.

                          Sincerely,

                                COLUMBUS, August 5, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I have just read the Amendment on the

schools question reported by your House committee. Is it not an

effort to get rid of our issue without accomplishing what the

public sentiment demands? It seems to me you should amend it.

Strike out the clause that gives Congress no legislative power

to enforce the provision and insert the usual clause giving Con-

gress power to enforce it by appropriate legislation. Think of









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          339</B>



this. Would it not be best to vote against the amendment pro-

posed if it is not perfected? It is an important thing to have this

amendment one that will be effectual.

                           Sincerely,

      Augusta, Maine.

  I am greatly obliged for your dispatch, and will give immediate

attention to its suggestions.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I am afraid it will be found that the House

has made a serious mistake in adopting the resolution on the

Sixteenth Amendment. I am sure they have, if the telegraph

has given us the exact facts.

  Schools are aided in New York and in other places by appro-

priations from public funds, which are plainly of a sectarian

character. Those funds may not be raised for public schools.

They may be from taxation for general purposes. The thing to

be prohibited is not merely a division of school funds but the

application of any public money to sectarian schools.

  But worst of all is the jesuitical clause at the close of the

amendment which deprives it of all value. That is not what the

friends of the amendment want. It is the work of the enemies

of the principle.

  I trust the Senate will promptly amend the resolution, give

Congress the usual power to enforce it by appropriate legislation,

and return it to the House. If the House refuses to concur, it

will make an issue which will destroy all chance of Democratic

success in the fall.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



Private.

                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 9, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I am in receipt of your esteemed favor

as to the prospects of the campaign [which were painted as ex-

ceedingly gloomy at that time] and making important sugges-

tions.  I also received and replied to your former letter.

  Let me assure you that nothing of the sort contained in your

letter will shake, or tend to shake, my faith in your hearty zeal

in the cause. To be frank is the best proof of it. I do not

usually give much thought to the prospects of a canvass.         So

far as they indicate something to be done, I try to consider

them. But having fired my shot, and supposing I would remain

passive hereafter, I have preferred not to know much that would

either depress or elate. I will, however, think seriously of your

suggestions.  It is to be hoped that as my past and my letters

and speeches, a few of which are published in Howard's "Life,"

are examined, the people will find that I am likely to be one of

the last men in the world to back out of a good work, deliberately

entered upon.  I send you a speech by Judge Johnston, a shrewd

observer.

  I wonder if you see what I am discovering beyond all question

in Ohio.  A  vast majority of "the plain people" think of this

as the main interest in the canvass:  A Democratic victory will

bring the Rebellion into power.  They point to a host of facts

and are greatly moved by them.  But in any event we are to

fight it out.  If the prospect is good it will be a pleasant task.

But if it is against odds the work will be nobler.

  I do not hear where you go earliest. You can do great good,

I learn, in Wisconsin, after you are through with New  York,

or rather the opening in New York.

  You do not send the whole of Mr. W--'s [Horace White's]

letter, but from what you send it looks as if Mr. W-- supposed

that North Carolina had a state election this year in August.

This is an error. No election there until November.

  With very hearty confidence in our cause, believe me,

                           Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- August 10.--The foregoing was written at my office

in the midst of interruptions. I wish to add my thanks for your

letter [to Mr. Oswald Ottendorfer, editor of the Staats Zeitung,

New York], and to congratulate you on its success. It is doing

good.

  We had the best convention and it gave us the best ticket

Cincinnati has had for years. The good elements of the party

were uppermost at all points. We have a fair fighting chance

to win, and this with the goodness of our cause ought to keep

us in good heart.--H.

  HONORABLE CARL SCHURZ.



  [After expressing very despondent views of the party's pros-

pects, Mr. Schurz had gone on to write: --

  "I do not want you to understand me as if these prospects

could influence my conduct in this campaign. Not at all. I shall

go to work as earnestly as if our chances were ever so good. I

think also that they can be greatly improved. But it requires

something which nobody can do for you; something which you

can only do for yourself. The artfully cultivated impression

that 'Governor Hayes, although an upright, able, and well-mean-

ing gentleman, has always sympathized with Grant  in all his

doings and is under such obligations to the old party leaders that

they will inevitably control his Administration,' is what hurts

you most.  Your Letter of Acceptance is sneered at as a bundle

of well-meant promises which the opposition of the old party

leaders will prevent you from carrying out. This impression









<B>342          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



must be destroyed. In my opinion some opportunity should be

made use of by yourself to express your sentiments in that re-

spect. If you do not like the flavor of a letter addressed to some

friend, it might be in a little speech to a serenading party or

something of that kind, and it can be done in language which

will not offend anybody, but appear as a simple sequel to your

Letter of Acceptance.

   "But in some way the country should be made to understand,

that you do not consider yourself under obligations to anybody,

either for a vote in the convention or support in the election;

that people who support you have to do so for the country's sake

and not your own; that in your opinion the duties of government

stand above all personal obligation; that those who inquire about

your opinions concerning public measures and current events

 (an allusion to Grant's recent performances) should read your

Letter of Acceptance; that those who indulge in speculations

as to what influences will be powerful in your Administration

should also study that document; that your Letter of Acceptance

contains your program of policy which was not only put forth

in good faith but will in every point be strictly adhered to; that

you were aware of the difficulties to be overcome in that respect;

that only such men and influences will be powerful with you in

your Administration, as will aid you in good faith in carrying

out that plan of policy and all the reforms included in it; that

you had promised this to the American people, and that nobody

had ever had reason to think R. B. Hayes capable of breaking

his word, etc. Such an expression of sentiment, giving proof

of your earnestness in strong and unmistakable language, would

go very far to remove the apprehensions which are now working

so strongly against us. And I repeat, nobody can do that for

you."]

  MY DEAR S--: -- I have your letter of the 8th. The enclosure

contains some things I can use. But, as a rule, when anything

is needed, it is better to advise the parties to attend to the affair

requiring notice themselves. I am so overwhelmed with demands









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          343</B>



on my time and pen that I can't address the gentlemen needed

as speakers or otherwise.

  I hate assessments. They are all wrong, and are sure to do

more harm than good. Office-holders, like other people, should

be left free to contribute or not as they choose.

  I am glad you are well organized in Illinois. All of such work

is contagious, and will spread from Chicago into the West and

Northwest generally.

                           Sincerely,

                                COLUMBUS, August 12, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Thanks for your speech; it is capital.

The true issue in the minds of the masses is simply, Shall the

late Rebels have the Government?

  As to the school issue: The Democrats are so afraid of it that

they will perhaps adopt anything to get it out of the way. The

question now is in good shape just as it stands. The Senate

committee has reported our Amendment and the House gave the

Democratic Amendment. Let the people choose. It is not im-

portant to pass it through the Senate at this session. Let it be

debated and considered by the country.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE J. A. GARFIELD.



  August 13. Sunday. -- Last night, with Attorney-General

John Little, I met Senator Morton at Bradford Junction, on his

request, to talk over the political situation. We rode together to

this place, having left here to meet him at 5:40 P. M. and

reached here at 12:45 A. M., after an interview of three hours.

Governor Morton regards the situation as grave; that if Indiana

is Democratic in October, our chance is not over one in ten of

success in the country in November; that if we carry Indiana in

October, our chances of carrying the country in November are

forty-nine in fifty; in short, that we lose the Presidency in









<B>344          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



November if we lose Indiana in October.  He thought it his

duty to state to me the condition and prospects; that we ought

to face it.  He detailed the figures of elections in Indiana since

1860.  He showed the closeness of the State.  Also referred

to the Greenback party--its organization, growing strength,

and the fact that it drew four-fifths of its voters from our side.

  I said, "And now the remedy?"  He after some further talk

said, "Money and speakers."  Money to pay men to travel and

organize, to print and circulate documents, etc., etc.  To my

question, "How much is needed to do the work required to carry

the State?" he replied one thousand dollars to a county will do

it, or ninety-four [actual number, ninety-two] counties, one hun-

dred thousand dollars.  I asked, "How much is generally used?"

He replied, "Four years ago we had from outside the State

fifty-five thousand dollars."  As to speakers, he named Judge

Kelley, Robert G. Ingersoll, Carl Schurz, Gibson, [George A.]

Sheridan, and perhaps others.  Others to be seen or written to on

the money question are Governor Morgan, Mr. ---, of Boston,

and perhaps others.

  On  the whole, his talk was not encouraging.  The use of

money, I have little faith in, and I am confident no such large

sum can be raised.  I mean to go through cheerfully and firmly

and with clean hands. If defeated, there will be no bitterness

in the disappointment, and I shall have my self-respect and an

approving conscience.

  4 P. M.--I just wrote General Buckland,<B>*</B> who is enjoying

the Centennial [Exposition at Philadelphia], the following hon-

est words:--"You are to be envied.  Now that the flush of

gratification upon the nomination is about at an end, I begin to

prefer the independence of a private citizen.  If the result leaves

me so, I will be the most contented defeated Presidential candi-

date, having any prospects, that was ever voted for."



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 13, 1876.

  MY DEAR LUCY:--I am lonely without you. . . .  Last

evening I went with Attorney-General Little to near the west

line of the State to ride back with Governor   Morton. We  left

about 6 P. M. and were at home about  Midnight.  Morton is

vigorous but has aged, and looks more like Nast's unfavorable

cartoons than I had supposed.  Mrs. Morton is a good woman.

She is at his side, looking out for all dangers, cheerful and in-

telligent.  He is not overconfident of Indiana, but will work well.

  When I am alone I always wish     I was a quiet private citizen

again.  But it will soon be [so] if we are beaten.  I almost hope

we shall be.  Independence is such a comfort and blessing.

                            As ever,

                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 13, 1876.

  MY DEAR R-:-  .  .  .  An important Matter.  Indiana is

close.  If we carry it the victory is ours in the Nation almost be-

yond a question.  If we lose it, with the South gone, (as it is, all

but one or two States) our chances are small.  The  Greenback

organizations draw  more from us than from the Democrats.  It

needs organization, speakers, documents, and  perhaps at two

points the establishment of Republican newspapers.  Think of it,

the important town of Terre Haute has no Republican paper!

For all this, money is required, and Now.  Will you see Mr.

Forbes [while you are in Boston] and spread this before him?

Our National Committee needs funds for the general campaign.

Ascertain what is doing.  If anything is done or to be done?  I

do not believe in any miscellaneous use of money in elections.

But for the objects named it is necessary.<B>*</B>

  MY DEAR GENERAL:- When I last saw you, you mentioned a

few places in Indiana as points at which you would be likely to

speak during the canvass. I now write to say that our friends

in that State think it important that you should speak at Indian-

apolis, Fort Wayne, Evansville, and other points, at as early a

day as may be practicable.

  In this State our nominations at Cincinnati, Dayton, Cleveland,

and in fact at all points, show that the best elements of the party

are in the ascendant. It is a decidedly noticeable feature of the

canvass.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



Private.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 17, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I am tempted to call your attention to

two facts: First, the character of the new men nominated by

the Republicans for Congress in this State--such men as Gov-

ernor Cox, Judge Force, Judge Matthews, General Keifer, John

Howard (Dayton), McKinley (Stark County), and the old

members like Garfield, to be renominated. Monroe, Danforth,

Foster, etc., etc. Perhaps all can be counted on to stand heartily

for the civil service reform of my Letter.  They are my cronies,

most of them, - in the same regiment, two; in the same college,

two, and so on. Now, is not this an assurance that we are on

strong ground? Second. On the other hand, General Ewing,

the champion of inflation, leads the Democratic delegation to

Congress. Think of it and take courage.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 18, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -I have your letter of the 16th. I agree per-

fectly that these political assessments, practically compulsory,









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          347</B>



are inconsistent with correct views of civil service reform, and

wrong.

  I doubt if this letter will reach you, and therefore only say

that it occurs to me the best thing is for me to authorize A. F.

Perry, of Cincinnati, now at the head of our electoral ticket,

to state authoritatively my well known views on this subject in

his discussion of the civil service part of my Letter. How will

this do?

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



Private.

                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 15, 1876.

  MY  DEAR SIR:-Our campaign in the States of Ohio and

Indiana is now opened and we are anxious to have you take part

in it, at as early a day as you may be able to do so. New York

can decide the election in our favor even if Indiana is carried

against us in October. But to carry Indiana at the state election

is no doubt a long step towards victory in New York. Besides,

your speeches in the West will attract great attention. They will

be published and strengthen us in all parts of the United States.

Your great speech in 1872 aroused and equipped our speakers

and furnished the press with arguments in every State. Your

presence here will impart to our canvass life and enthusiasm,

and insure that energetic effort which brings out a full vote and

commands success.

  The more meetings you can address, the better; but if you

speak only in two or three leading cities in each of the States

named and at Chicago and Milwaukee, I shall feel that you have

placed the country and all of us under great obligations.

                    Sincerely, your friend,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE ROSCOE CONKLING.



  Columbus, August 19, 1876.-Nothing during the canvass

thus far has been said by adversaries against me, that has given

me much trouble. The attacks have been chiefly false statements









<B>348          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



as to the coal miners' strike in the Tuscarawas Valley, as to my

being a salary grabber, as to joining a secret anti-foreigners

order in Philadelphia, July 5, as to the [temperance] crusade,

as to embezzling two cannon captured in West Virginia, [and]

as to neglecting to pay my board at Princeton,West Virginia,

during the war.

  The only slander that has given me annoyance is the one re-

ferred to in my letter addressed to Major Carey, Colonel Brown,

General Devol, [and]  General Hastings.  It was printed in a

Democratic paper at Point Pleasant, and two publications have

been made in the Cincinnati Enquirer in regard to it. It worries

my friends in Pomeroy, Gallipolis, and the Kanawha Valley.  I

have not wished to make any denials of any falsehood over my

own signature.  [I have preferred] to leave my  friends to deal

with all such affairs. It now occurs to me to allow Loomis

(B. J.), of the [Cincinnati] Commercial, to interview me about it.

Governor Hendricks has done this about some wench story or

other slander. I will now set down what can be said in an

interview:-

  Reporter. - I have called to ask if you object to an interview

on the subject of the story of the deserter's money, said to have

been appropriated by you to your own use?

  Answer.-- I do not intend to discuss political questions during

my candidacy; at least, that is my present purpose about it, and

I would decline to be interviewd on public affairs, but this charge.

aimed at my character for integrity, and as a soldier, is of such

a nature that I am glad to have an opportunity to reply to it

publicly.

  Reporter. - Please give me the facts in regard to this charge.

  Answer. -The charge is that I appropriated to my own use

four hundred dollars in money taken from a man who was shot

as a deserter or spy (for he was both) at Monocacy Junction.

Maryland, in General Sheridan's Army of the Shenandoah, in

August, 1864. The case was a remarkable one on account of the

coincidences which led him to his fate. In the fall of 1863, he

came in Rebel uniform into the Union lines in the Kanawha

Valley, claiming to be a Union man who had been forced into

the Rebel army.      Subsequently,  he enlisted in  Company  D,









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          349</B>



Twenty-third Ohio. Soon after he became sick and was in hos-

pital a month or two. Next he deserted, taking with him arms

and equipments, with watches and pistols that he stole from his

comrades. Afterwards, May 9, 1864, he was taken prisoner

with arms in his hands, fighting in the Rebel ranks at Cloyd's

Mountain, was recognized by Twenty-third men who were de-

tailed to guard prisoners, and finding he was discovered managed

to escape in the night.

  In August afterwards, a squad of recruits and drafted men

and substitutes was brought to the Twenty-third Regiment from

Ohio, while the regiment was camped at Monocacy Junction,

August 5, 1864. Among them this Rebel deserter, Union de-

serter, and spy and bounty-jumper was discovered.

  The facts were reported to General Crook's headquarters. His

adjutant-general, Captain J. L. Bottsford, ordered a drumhead

court martial to meet immediately.  The  court was  probably

mainly from my brigade.  But I was not on the court and had

nothing to do with it, as I now remember.  The man was tried,

found guilty, and sentenced to be shot. He confessed that after

his escape in June, 1864, he went down the Kanawha to Ohio

and became a bounty-jumper.  That he had received a number

of times bounties from localities and perhaps individuals and had

deserted; was prevented from doing it on this occasion by the

recent order which required that recruits should be receipted for

at their regiments before payment of bounties; that he had

money, about four hundred dollars, received for bounties he had

jumped, and two watches; that he had no family, unless he had

a mother living whom he had not seen in some years and whose

residence he couldn't tell.

  After the trial, members of the court martial, on talking it

over, concluded that as the bounty money of the Rebel spy and

deserter was received from localities or individuals and the

Government to furnish a soldier for the Twenty-third Regiment;

that it ought to be used to get another recruit for the same regi-

ment, and that it should be delivered to the proper officer for

that purpose. In all this I concurred. I have always supposed

that this was accordingly done with the money.

  I have often told the story of this spy and deserter, it being









<B>350          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



interesting on account of its coincidences, and have always spoken

of the money as being used to get a recruit for the Twenty-third

in place of the Rebel deserter and spy. Mr. Harper says an

orderly came from me after him, and that at my headquarters he

gave up the money in the presence of General Comly. I have

no recollection of it. But we were in the midst of the busiest

year of the war, and were just entering on one of the most

exciting and absorbing campaigns of that year, viz., Sheridan's

Shenandoah Valley campaign. Since hearing of this affair last

month, I have tried to find out all I could about it. I wrote the

following letter and sent copies to surviving officers likely to

know about it, as soon as I could learn their address.

  I sent [the letter] to Major Carey of the Twenty-third, who

was president of the court martial, and received a reply; to

General Devol, who commanded [the] Thirty-sixth Ohio, one of

the regiments of my brigade, and [received] a reply; to Colonel

Brown, ditto, and a reply; to General Enochs; to Captain Joseph

L. Bottsford, General Crook's adjutant-general and a reply;

[to] my adjutant-general, and others. I hear of none who recol-

lect the payment of the money by Harper, but it might have oc-

curred. My orderly, who was most likely to have carried the

word to Mr. Harper, if he was sent for, was George Brigdon,

my color-bearer. He was killed in battle, within four weeks

after the execution of this deserter, at Berryville. The most

probable man to have been judge-advocate was Captain Gillis,

Twenty-third, who was killed at the same battle. Captain Austin,

Twenty-third, another possible member, killed in same battle.

Captain, afterwards Major, Thompson, of Twenty-third, is now

dead. General Hastings, my adjutant-general, was absent the

evening of the execution. Lieutenant Mather, Thirteenth Vir-

ginia, one of my aides, is confident Mr. Harper never gave up

the money; is ready to swear to conversations with Harper, in

which he (Harper) admitted having the money long after the

trial. My other aide, Lieutenant O. J. Wood, Thirty-sixth Ohio,

I have not heard from.

  Reporter. - What became of the watches?









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          351</B>



  Answer. - I understand that Mr. Harper has never been able

to find the mother of the deserter, and he, therefore, still has the

watches in his possession.

  Reporter. - What does Harper refer to when he says that both

himself and you (Hayes) have been "maligned" and slandered

about this money?

  Answer.-I do not know. I never heard an intimation that

there was a charge against me until since my nomination.  Major

Carey says the same, and so Colonel Devol.

  A number of recruits came to the regiment after this affair

at Monocacy. I have always believed that one of them was ob-

tained with this money. I have no recollection of receiving the

money, as stated by Mr. Harper, but if I did, I believe his state-

ment is substantially correct. At the same time I know that I

never retained the money in my custody.  I never used it or

appropriated it to my own use. If handed to me, it was im-

mediately then and there given over to the proper officer to get

another recruit.<B>*</B>

  MY DEAR SIR: - I am satisfied that the state election in Indiana

is of the greatest importance. Without dwelling on the topic I

now write to urge liberal- I mean, exceptionally liberal- ap-

propriations to Indiana of material aid.  Too much cannot, in my

judgment, be done. If our friends in Illinois will take hold of it,

the State of Indiana can probably be carried and in that case

victory in the nation is insured in November.  I write this be-

cause I believe it is necessary to do it.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - I hear from two friends that you feel

"gloomy" as to the prospects. Your influence is large. You can

influence many minds.  It is too early to make figures. Let me

urge you to great caution in this regard.

  I have stopped all the practices you complain of within my

reach.  Some are denied.  Some are explained.        I would write

more fully, but money has corrupted one post-office clerk, and I

do not feel safe.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -My  inquiries do not show such a state

of facts as seem to warrant a personal statement. The news-

paper accounts are denied. But in any event, all who support me

are authorized to argue by my Letter and by my well known

opinions, that I do not believe in compulsory, or other official,

assessments.  It is the simple truth.  Worse things are reported

to me, not of a political nature, than those you allude to.

  I wish I could talk to the public on this whole subject, with

somebody else standing in my position as the candidate.

  You overestimate the weight with me of the consideration that

defeat may follow certain conduct. Do not misunderstand me.

I can stand defeat very well. I want to do what is sensible and

right, and can afford to abide the consequences.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 30, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - I am sorry not to be able to meet you

at  Cincinnati.  Can't  we  meet  here  before  you  return?

Your speeches do great good.  We should cultivate a hopeful

tone. Men in the right can afford to be cheerful even if the out-

look is gloomy. Since New York we are surely bound to gain.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL C. SCHURZ.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 5, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:-I send you another more careful state-

ment. The values were in fact put down by me, and I am willing

to stand by them.  The only question possible was as to my treat-

ment of the credits coming from Birchard.  You will see my

reply is twofold and either is ample. Besides, the official looked

into it and concurred with me. This on the first occasion in 1874.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P.S. - I owned no piano, nor was one in the house until Sep-

tember, 1875, when one was rented by my wife, to be used by a

relative visiting us, during my absence in the canvass last fall.

I bought it this summer by trading a lot for it.--H.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 6, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:- Your esteemed favor of the third finds

me overwhelmed with letters, dispatches, and inquiries about the

latest scandal-the charge that I made false returns of property

for taxation in 1874-5-6.  I had just, with much trouble and

worriment, hunted down and closed out the four-hundred-dollar

slander, and supposed I was out of the woods. But I suspect

the case made against Tilden is to be replied to by a flood of

falsehood and calumny about me.

  The truth is, my property returns were full, honest, and, if in

error at all as to values, they were placed above the actual cash

values. My extravagancies, if I have any, run to books; and to

trees, flowers, and other improvements of my place.  I had noth-

ing in the way of furniture, horses, or equipages that were [was]

    23









<B>354          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



more than barely decent. But it is easy to talk of expensive

horses, carriages, etc. As to wealth, my property is almost en-

tirely real estate. The rest, bank and other stocks, taxed in the

name of the corporation. You may feel safe that in all this there

is no damaging fact. And whenever the truth can be known, as

it is at my home, there will be nothing in it to relieve the case

against Tilden, whatever that may be. I send you enclosed a

pretty good account of this affair published by General Comly in

the State Journal of this morning. I do not wish to weary you

with this. But it concerns my character for common honesty

in ordinary life, and I confess that I am interested more in that

than in that which touches my prospects of political advance-

ment.

  I am somewhat surprised by the contents of your note.<B>*</B> But

perhaps you are right. My only correspondence is with Mr. Mc-

Cormick, and he is perhaps not as agreeably situated as could be

wished. I hope to see General Cox next Sunday or Monday, and

if so will confer with him about it. In the meantime let me

assure you that my stakes, as set in the Letter, will stand. If

elected you can trust me to adhere to the text. No political,

no partisan duty, (if such things can be called duties!) - at any

rate, no partisan or personal service shall be required, or allowed

to be required, of public officers.

  The general drift of the campaign is thought by the active men

I meet to be in our favor. But any observer can see that the

result is in doubt. This will not, I hope, discourage men who are

in earnest.                  Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

<FONT SIZE="-1">  * Information, apparently well authenticated, that assessments for party

purposes were being levied on clerks in the various government offices

at Washington. Mr. Schurz urged Mr. Hayes to "protest against all

practices not in entire harmony with his Letter of Acceptance", adding:

"I am sure you will gain immensely in strength the very moment you

protest against such practices and demand the refunding of the money.

It will not only be right, it will be one of the greatest strokes of the

campaign and do more than all our speeches." Two days later Mr.

Hayes wrote his protest to Mr. McCormick, secretary of the Republican

National Committee.</FONT>

  MY DEAR SIR: - I send you a slip, cut from an Eastern news-

paper, on the subject of assessments upon officials' salaries for

political purposes. It is charged that this is done by authority of

the Republican National Committee.

   My views as to what ought to be required of office-holders

are set forth in my Letter of Acceptance and are no doubt suffi-

ciently well known. But I think it is proper to say to the com-

mittee, that if assessments are made as charged, it is a plain de-

parture from correct principles and ought not to be allowed.

I trust the committee will have nothing to do with it.

                            Sincerely,

Indiana.  Now, Indiana is a Democratic State.  Emigration of

Republicans West and the greenback heresy have made it so.

Until within a fortnight I have seen small chance of carrying it.

The chances are still greatly against us. The true pivot is New

York. Let us, therefore, prepare our friends and the public not

to be disheartened if Indiana is wrong, especially our friends in

the East.  October will not decide the election unless both Ohio

and Indiana go the same way.  This is the truth.  We ought to

see that it is so understood everywhere.

  DEAR SIR:--I regret that my office and engagements will pre-

in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia.

  Having labored during almost the whole of my political life

  September 14.- As an offset to what is said of Governor

Tilden's income returns, mine have been examined. It appears

that in 1868 and 1869, I made none at all. No doubt, all I made

are substantially accurate.  If none were made in the two years

named, it was because my attention was not called to the matter,

- a mere oversight.  My taxable income in those years did not

exceed fifteen hundred or twenty-five hundred dollars.  If no

return can be found and no payments [were] made, there is due

from me the tax on that amount, and it will be paid.  If no re-

turns were made in the two years 1868 and 1869, it was because

no returns were called for.  I had left Cincinnati, December,

1867, and had my domicile at Columbus- my permanent resi-

dence still remaining at Cincinnati.



                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 14, 1876.

  DEAR MAJOR: -Colonel Barnes has been lied about on the

secret society business, and misrepresented on the crusade. I

wish you would give him all the help you can. Let him see peo-

ple with the right men to remove false impressions and place

him fairly before our Republican friends.  It will do good.

                           Sincerely,

I trust it will not prove a serious injury and that you will soon

be well.

  Touching the assessments, I am clear it is not for me to call

attention to the acts of the officials, except as they are induced

by the committee appointed by the National Convention. I wrote

a private note to my only correspondent on the Committee, and

talked to Governor Noyes.  I send you Governor McCormick's

reply, which please return.  I send also a copy of my note, for

private use only as matters now stand, and until I give consent

to its publication.

  Your speech on "hard times" was exceedingly happy. It is the

best handling of that dangerous topic I have yet seen, by great

odds. The canvass daily brings to the front, more and more,

as the two leading topics, the danger of a "united South" victory,

and Tilden's record as a reformer. You can denounce all

charges of [my] hostility to foreigners as voters and office-

holders as utterly unfounded. They are the merest roorbacks. I

have always voted for naturalized citizens, have often appointed

them to office, and shall always hold to the same opinions on that

subject which I presume you do. I, of course, don't like Catholic

interference or any sectarian interference with politics, or the

schools.  All of this paragraph is public, and always openly

avowed by me. I was not a Know-nothing when my political

associates generally ran off after that ephemeral party.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--I need hardly assure you that if I ever have charge

of an Administration this whole assessment business will go up,

"hook, line, and sinker."-H.

                            COLUMBUS, September 15, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:- Since writing you this morning I have

received your note on the roorback about Chandler [that Chand-

ler had demanded that Schurz make no more campaign speeches].

There is surely no foundation for it. But in any event, I desire

that you speak. Governor Morton desires it. The party de-

sires it.  The people generally who approve of our principles

desire it, and no man can say nay to it.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                            COLUMBUS, September 15, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I see a paragraph about pardons. There

can't be anything legitimately made against either Governor









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          359</B>



Tilden or myself on this head, as I see it. A list of pardons

shows nothing of the papers or facts, on which they are granted.

To blame Governor Tilden on a mere list is the sheerest guess-

work. A list as long in proportion to time, population, [and]

number of convicts can be made out against the wisest governor.

Think of it.               Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  DEAR SIR: - I send your valuable letter to the National Com-

mittee and have written to others in regard to it. But we must

all remember that after all the best work is always done by the

home people. With that, good results may always be anticipated;

without that, no outside aid will save you.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  H. C. PARSONS.

                            COLUMBUS, September 16, 1876.

  MY DEAR S-: - Yours of the 13th shows you did good work

[in your paragraph for publication in Eastern papers, discounting

the effect of a Democratic victory in the October election in

Indiana]. As to Ohio, the Allen and Cary Greenbackers will, in

October, support the ticket they made, but in November a large

number will vote for Cooper and many more for "anybody to

beat Tilden." Our candidate for secretary of state will lose

votes in the cities on the crusade. But, I suspect, we shall pull

through.

  I shall certainly hear Ingersoll.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

      Chicago.

                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 16, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:-I have yours of the 31st. At this time the

tide is with us; at least, this is the opinion of our friends gen-









<B>360          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



erally.  I think it is so.  In Ohio, the contest in October will be

close.

  The Greenback Democracy made the state ticket of the party,

and will support it heartily.  The Tilden Democracy will support

it for the effect on November.

  In November, Greenback Democrats, in considerable numbers,

will vote for Cooper, and others for Hayes.  They hate Tilden

because he tried to beat Allen last year. Indiana leans to the

Democracy.  It is owing to emigration West that Ohio and

Indiana are not Republican. Catholics are taking the places of

Republican farmers and soldiers.  But if the tide is, as our

friends think, we shall pull through. The point you make as the

controlling idea of the canvass [that is, the danger to the country

of a victory by the united South] is rapidly becoming the one

topic of the press and of speakers. It does tell. Excuse haste.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE EDWARDS PIERREPONT,

      MINISTER TO ENGLAND.



                     COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 18, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--The impression seems to be general that the

tide is with the Republicans. No good thing can come from a

Democratic victory gained through a united South.  This is the

sentiment that is growing and winning. I am exceedngly pleased

with the aid given by the contribution of the Tribune.  I will have

the committee procure lists to be sent to you direct from the

districts on account of the Tribune's subscription for Ohio.

  Our advices from the East concur with your opinion that New

York is safe unless both Ohio and Indiana are carried by the

Democrats in October by decided majorities.

                          Sincerely,

HONORABLE JAMES G. BLAINE,

       Parker House, Boston, Massachusetts.

   Mr. Kreass is unwilling to release you but Mr. Bingham ap-

preciates the situation and seems willing to have you withdrawn.

You were announced to be at Warren on the 23d, at least two

weeks ago.  Last year the great Warren meeting marked the

turning-point of the campaign, and we  hope it will this year.

General Garfield dare not face the people of Warren if you are

absent and the meeting would have to be given up. This would

be very disastrous. Our election is less than three weeks hence.

If the Philadelphia gentlemen will not postpone the meeting

themselves, we will have to respectfully insist on our prior en-

gagement.

  I am grateful to my comrades of the Union Army, assembled

  The men who maintained the cause of nationality and freedom

on so many battlefields are not willing to see the results of the

explanations except in very important cases. This does not seem

is it not for the accuser to name date, persons, case, etc., etc.?

  P.S. -This for your ear and eye alone.

  Columbus, September 23, 1876.- I yesterday was called on

at my office by Chief Justice Waite. Among other things we

talked of Tilden. I asked him if the tax return charges were

believed. He said yes. That Tilden was a miser, very exacting

-"exacting to the last degree." That he could in confidence

give me an incident. He (Waite) was foreclosing a mortgage on

a railroad (perhaps, Atlantic and Great Western). Tilden repre-

sented the first-mortgage bondholders.  Waite, on behalf of his

clients, was very anxious to enter a decree. It was also in the

interest of Tilden's clients. But it couldn't be done without

Tilden's consent. Time was of such importance that Waite spent

several hours trying to get Tilden's consent. Tilden had no

right to ask any money for his consent. Neither the interests of

his clients required it, nor had he rendered any services that en-

titled him to it.  But he had the power.  "To get his consent I

had to pay him thirty thousand dollars. He probably divided

with others. But that is Tilden."

  September 24. - I am looking anxiously forward to the end of

the contest. It is now almost one hundred days since the nomi-

nation, and only about forty-five to the election. The general

drift of the campaign has been rather favorable to our side for

some weeks past. The greenback heresy in Indiana and Ohio is

likely to cause those States to do badly in October. If there was

no election before the final vote in November, I should feel very

confident of a favorable result. But our friends East and else-

where count on more favorable results in Ohio and Indiana than

are likely to occur. We shall be much stronger at the Presidential

elections in both States. But the discouraging effect of defeats

in October is sure to hurt us. Our adversaries are to be cor-

respondingly encouraged. The truth is, time and money would









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          363</B>



be saved if all elections in Presidential years were fixed for the

same day. It should be done.

  "I am prepared for either event," I can again repeat. To go

into the great office will be a sore trial. Health, comfort, happi-

ness, all imperilled, if not sacrificed. I shall find reasons enough

for satisfaction with the result, if I am defeated. If elected,

the firmest adherence to principle against all opposition and

temptations, is my purpose. I shall show a grit that will astonish

those who predict weakness.

                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 28, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -Your note of the 25th is at hand. It is no

doubt true that both the hards and softs at the state election in

Ohio are united in support of the state Democratic ticket. The

softs because it is their ticket, and the hards for the effect on

November. It is also true that large numbers of the softs will

be for Cooper in November or will decline to vote. Besides, the

hard times tell strongly against a hard-money candidate in both

Ohio and Indiana.      Your  warning is therefore not without

reason. Our friends are heeding it. We shall pull through.

                           Sincerely,

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 2, 1876.

  MY DEAR S-:--I have just seen the [Chicago] Times of

Saturday.  Leroy's attempt to blackmail me can't need much at-

tention.  Hastings can give you all that is needed.  But I suspect

the letters purporting to be from me are none of them given

correctly. Certainly the letter of November 16, 1869, is a forgery.

No such letter was ever written.  It is made out of whole cloth.

If it becomes important I can find the whole of Leroy's letters

at my house in Fremont.  It iS all a fraud. Write me if it

needs my personal attention. I think not.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

       Chicago.



  Columbus, October 4, 1876. -- Birthday.  Fifty-four years of

age. The good omen of the day is that Colorado, the first State

to elect electors (or rather a Legislature that will elect electors).

has been carried by the Republicans. "First gun for Hayes," is

the headline of the Journal.

   I called on Blaine at Ewing Miller's.  He looks well; is clear-

headed, prompt, and quick-witted, with no trace that I detect

of his great calamity.  He is hopeful and friendly.  I called with

him on Mrs. Ben Smith, on Lucy, and at my office.  We met

Wayne McVeagh.  He [Blaine] has almost precisely my views

and hopes as to the South.  By conciliating Southern whites, on

the basis of obedience to law and equal rights, he hopes we may

divide the Southern whites, and so protect the colored people.



                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 5, 1876.

   MY DEAR S-:- Touching Lee's letter to the secretary of the

 American Alliance, I write these observations:--

   1.  It was written without my knowledge, before or after.  I

never heard of it until now. Lee had a general authority to reply

to letters of congratulation and tenders of support--"suitable

acknowledgements" merely.









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          365</B>



  2. I see nothing damaging, specially, in the letter if we don't

write it into importance. It approves and endorses nothing.

  3. The resolutions it replies to in acknowledging are eight in

number, adopted at Philadelphia, July 4 and 5, and are all such

as Republican foreigners, not Catholics, approve. You have seen

the resolutions.

  4.  The whole affair is to put us on the defensive, and will

fail if we are not led off by it. Three of our most intelligent

Germans, speaking of it (Cincinnati Germans), say it will not

hurt a particle. That Republican Germans do not mind such

roorbacks, etc., etc.

  5. The drift of the canvass is plain. The people do dread

a victory for the united South. They see in it continued trouble;

nullification of the Amendments, Rebel claims, and schemes, etc.,

etc., etc.; and I think anything which withdraws attention from

this issue to merely personal matters is a mistake. The school is-

sue, the civil service issue, the currency issue, etc., are all in point

and good, but merely personal issues may well be dropped with

a few words of denunciation.

  We see encouragement here and it increases daily.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

      Chicago.



  [This letter practically anticipated and forestalled a letter of

alarm written to Mr. Hayes the very same day by Mr. Smith.

Mr. Smith wrote:-"I have had a siege with our Republican

friends here yesterday and today about Colonel Lee's letter to

the American Alliance. A panic has prevailed, and there is a good

deal of feeling.  .  .  .  Mr. Medill [editor of the Tribune]

is quite put out -  well, downright mad, and so are Generals

Logan and Babcock. I have put as good a face on as I could,

and Mr. Medill is going to try and help out in an editorial in the

morning. But he thinks the case really requires heroic treatment.

         I hope your wisdom will suggest something then to aid

us with the great foreign population  of the Northwest.  It is









<B>366          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



absolutely necessary to offset the extensive and insidious work

of the enemy in Wisconsin and Chicago especially."]



  October 12. - The elections have gone precisely as I expected.

For three months I have predicted that New York would decide

the result; that Ohio in October would go Republican, and Indi-

ana Democratic. At this writing, Ohio, on the test candidate,

seems to be eight thousand for us, and Indiana against us.





                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 12, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Your note on leaving the West came

during my absence at Fremont. The elections at this writing

seem to have gone precisely as I have expected for three months.

They leave New York to decide. We need no further help in

Ohio. In November fifteen thousand to thirty thousand for our

ticket - at least those figures - are assured.  The misfortune is

the loss of Matthews. The Germans did well. But the Southern

trade argument and "more money" carried off the Israelites in

large numbers, and more than that, fraudulent voting and

naturalizations did the rest. Your reply to the Know-nothing

charge is ample, and fully authorized by me and the facts. We

should set off against it the Gray Nuns Act of Tilden. Firmness,

hopefulness, and work should be our motto, for the sake of the

cause.

  Many thanks for your most efficient work.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



Personal.

                              COLUMBUS, October 14, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--The elections have gone just about as I an-

ticipated in these two States. Our majority in Ohio, on the true

test, is about nine thousand. It is made up by handsome gains

in the rural districts which overcome losses in the cities. The

reliable Republican counties have given their full high-tide ma-









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          367</B>



jorities. The cities, like Springfield, where business and manu-

facturing are prosperous, have done well. Our losses are in

cities and towns where the hard times pinch. All of the non-

Catholic foreigners, Germans, Welsh, etc., etc., have stood by us

except the trading classes in Cincinnati, who feared a loss of

Southern trade; and even there I doubt if we lost in the foreign

Republican vote. I infer from this that a full vote makes Wis-

consin ours beyond all question. We shall double our majority

here in November without effort.

  Indiana is surely now a doubtful State. We have a fair

fighting chance to carry it; a much better chance than we had to

carry it in October. I do not write of the East. You understand

about the situation there. In the South, if we have a prospect to

carry any States, we must look after North and South Carolina,

Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

  Another matter I would like to hear from you about. Ohio

Republicans, interested in the Centennial, want an Ohio Day,

and wish me to be present, next week or the week after. Should

it be encouraged?

  Know-nothing charges made by the Democrats, the people

here care nothing about. It is perfectly well known that I do

not favor the exclusion of foreigners from the ballot or from

office, and that I do oppose Catholic interference and all sectarian

interference with political affairs, and especially with the schools.

This last point is influential, particularly with non-Catholic

foreigners. It has not, I suspect, been sufficiently urged in the

canvass.

  But I need not take up your time with these rambling specu-

lations. The contest is now with the East. The inflation States

have done better for the hard-money candidates than you had a

right to expect. Now let the hard-money States do as well, and

we are safe.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  R. C. MCCORMICK,

      SECRETARY REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,

           New York.









<B>368          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                               COLUMBUS, October 14, 1876.

  MY DEAR S-: - I was much disappointed not to see you with

ample time for conference.

  The postmaster at Milwaukee writes Lee that there are Turn-

ers in Milwaukee who are troubled by a report that I favor an

amendment "putting God in the Constitution." Of course it is

not so.  The only amendment I support now is one which will

prevent sectarian or Catholic interference with the schools. This

will be found stated clearly in my Letter.

  I am confident a full vote will make Wisconsin safe.  Ohio

results show clearly:--I. We stand as well as ever with the

Germans.  2.  We get full, high-tide majorities in Republican

strongholds. Six or seven of them never did better at corre-

sponding elections.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. - It is expected that I go to Ohio Day at the Centennial

next week, 26th I think.  If you know of any good reason why

I should not go, let me have your suggestions early -perhaps

by telegraph.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.





  Columbus, October 15, 1876. - The October elections leave the

result of the Presidential contest still in doubt, and to be decided

by New York in November.  That Ohio has done so well is a

great satisfaction. My friends urged as one of their strongest

arguments for my nomination, that Ohio was a doubtful State,

that its loss in October would he fatal, that no man named except

myself could surely carry it in October, that with me as the

candidate success in Ohio in October was assured, that I always

had carried it, and would do so again. After all this, the loss

of Ohio in October would have been a sore mortification.

  We had at the head of our ticket a good soldier and citizen,

but one who was mixed up with the temperance crusade which

was so hateful to all Germans. and to many others.  He was a









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          369</B>



load-a heavy load-to carry.  But our prominent Germans,

brewers and others, behaved admirably, nobly, and we are safe!

I can bear defeat in November far more philosophically than I

could have borne the loss of Ohio in October. My own ward,

town, county, and congressional district did well, indeed, very

handsomely.   This is gratifying.  Endorsed by my  State and

home, I feel gratified by the result.





                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 19, 1876.

  MY  DEAR GENERAL:-Thanks  for your letter of the 15th.

Your speech and meeting evidently were very successful.  Our

German vote in New York City has never been, I believe, very

large. Mr. Bohn tells me that in Cleveland our loss of Germans

was chiefly a few leaders-that the people stood firm.

  I send you enclosed a letter on the greenback movement. The

writer, I do not know. If there is any authority for what he

says, we shall see the signs of it in the movements of the ad-

versary.

  I shall go to the Ohio Day next week, 26th, at the Centennial,

but will avoid political demonstrations and the hospitalities which

may be offered. This, according to a promise I made our man-

agers if Ohio was right at the elections. Following Tilden's

example?

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 20, 1876.

  MY DEAR S-: - I have your letter. Nobody here, prominent

or otherwise, advises me to resign. A canard.

  The Know-nothing charges are more than met (not by denial

or explanation) but by charging Democrats with their Catholic

alliance.  It is felt by our Protestants and freethinkers to be both

important and true. Tilden's Gray Nuns Act with suitable head-

lines and comments is a complete reply. It is printed on slips

for distribution and is very effective. I send you an article by

     24









<B>370          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



a German Democrat of Cincinnati which contains it and other

matter.

  My information from the East is encouraging.

                           Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



  Columbus, October 22, 1876.  Sunday. -Only two Sundays

more before the Presidential election. I am surprised, whenever

I think of it, to find myself so cool, so almost indifferent about it.

It would be a calamity, I am sure, to give the Democrats the

Government. But public opinion, the press, the march of events,

will compel them to do better than their character and principles

indicate. Here is our safety. Public opinion, the fear of losing

the public confidence, apprehension of censure by the press,

make all men in power conservative and safe.

  On personal grounds, I find many reasons for thinking defeat

a blessing. I should stand by my Letter, I should hew to the line;

but what conflicts and annoyances would follow! I do not fear

my pluck or constancy a particle. But to be deceived by the

rogues, to find many a trusted reformer no better than he should

be, - here would be humiliations and troubles without end.

  The huge registration in New York City looks sinister. It

seems to look to our defeat in that State.

  Another danger is imminent: A contested result. And we

have no such means for its decision as ought to be provided

by law. This must be attended to hereafter. We should not

allow another Presidential election to occur before a means for

settling a contest is provided. If a contest comes now it may lead

to a conflict of arms. I can only try to do my duty to my country-

men in that case. I shall let no personal ambition turn me from

the path of duty. Bloodshed and civil war must be averted if

possible.  If forced to fight, I have no fears of failure from lack

of courage or firmness.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 24, 1876.

  DEAR SIR: -You may say to anybody that I am not opposed

to the right to vote or hold office of foreign-born citizens, and









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          371</B>



 that I never belonged to any society or association holding that

 principle. I never approved or sympathized with such an opinion,

 and all charges that I have joined the American Alliance are

 untrue.

                         Respectfully,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

   MR. W. S. RIDGWAY.



   Sunday, October 29.- Returned last night from Ohio Day at

 the Centennial. It was an enthusiastic and prodigious crowd

 which greeted me. I managed to shake some four thousand

 people by the hand and to make half a dozen speeches from steps,

 windows, and roof of the Ohio Building, without saying any-

thing that I regret - without "slopping over." Lucy, Birch,

Webb, Fanny, and Scott, with our colored servants, were with

me. The party was a good one: General and Laura Mitchell,

Colonel Weir, and going on Mrs. Governor Noyes, Mrs. Harry

R. Smith, Mr. Platt, and Emily; and, returning, we had (instead

of Platt and Emily, Mrs. Noyes, and Mrs. Smith) General Ben-

jamin Harrison and his wife of Indiana, to Pittsburgh, and from

Pittsburgh to Columbus, Mr. Green and General Wilcox. A

happy journey.

  I return feeling that with the probabilities of fraud and violence

-fraud, North; violence, South- the chances are that we shall

lose the election. My luck is the other way. But I have made a

good fight; sound Letter to stand on, a judicious course of con-

duct throughout, my head steady and level up to this time. Let

me keep it so ten days longer.

  November 1, 1876.- The contest is close and yet doubtful,

with the chances, as I see them, rather against us. So small a loss

as the defeat in Hamilton County [Cincinnati] in October may

have made the difference between victory and defeat. A few

hundred votes' improvement there would have given our friends

the prestige of victory in Ohio and throughout the country. Our

loss was due to bribery and repeating. The hard times, if we

are beaten, may be assigned as the great and sufficient cause. All

crimes are increased by hard times. It is especially so with









<B>372          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



crimes against the ballot-box. It is easy to hire men desperate

with want to vote contrary to their convictions, and even to be-

come repeaters. Hard times, then, is the ultimate cause of our

danger. We shall be beaten, if at all, by crime -by bribery and

repeating North, and violence and intimidation in the South.





                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 2, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - In the hurry of numerous calls on my

attention I neglected to reply to a suggestion as to becoming a

subscriber or member of some enterprise which you commended,

and which would cost, I think you said, five dollars. I know I

meant to say yes when I read it, but omitted to do so.  What-

ever it is, I say yes now.

  Of course we are now "waiting for the verdict."  My feeling

about it is just as I would wish it to be -no undue anxiety on

personal account, and there will be no soreness in case of defeat.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

      Cincinnati.

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 3, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -  I meant to meet you at the depot yes-



terday, but was prevented. It is now too late to speculate on

results.  I shall find many things to console me if defeated.      I

feel more than ever satisfied with having written a square Letter.

Very little occurs to me that I would have changed during the

canvass.  The hard times, with the consequent desire for change,

and the opportunity which such times give for the corrupt use

of money by our adversaries, have greatly affected the strength

of parties. In any event, I am exceedingly gratified by what

you have done in the canvass, and shall always remember it with

thankfulness and satisfaction.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.









             <B>THE HAYES-TILDEN CAMPAIGN          373</B>



  November 5, 1876.  Sunday.- The election is only a day or

two off, and I find myself strangely calm and indifferent about it.

I shall read Mr. Andrews' address and other matter, as much

interested in what I am doing as usual.  It now looks as if the

chance of my election was improving, and as if Republican suc-

cess was not improbable.

  I make a list of States to be counted certain for us as fol-

lows:-Maine,  7  [votes],  New  Hampshire,  5, Vermont,  5,

Massachusetts, 13, Rhode Island, 4, Pennsylvania, 29, Ohio, 22,

Michigan, 11, Illinois, 21, Minnesota, 5, Iowa, 11, Nebraska, 3,

Kansas, 5, Colorado, 3. Total, 144. Necessary to a choice 185.

  Probably Republican:-Wisconsin, 10, California, 6, South

Carolina, 7.-23.  Total, 167.

  This leaves 18 [votes] required to elect out of the following

doubtful States:-New Jersey, 9, Nevada, 3, Florida, 4, New

York 35, Indiana, 15, North Carolina, 10, Louisiana, 8, Con-

necticut, 6, Oregon. 3,-93.

  Columbus, November 7, 1876.-Dies irae -A  cold but dry

day. Good enough here for election work. I still think Demo-

cratic chances the best. But it is not possible to form a confident

opinion. If we lose, the South will be the greatest sufferer. Their

misfortune will be far greater than ours.  I do not think a re-

vival of business will be greatly postponed by Tilden's election.

Business prosperity does not, in my judgment, depend on gov-

ernment so much as men commonly think. But we shall have no

improvement in civil service - deterioration rather, and the

South will drift towards chaos again.
