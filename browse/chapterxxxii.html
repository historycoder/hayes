  FREMONT, OHIO, OCTOBER 31, 1875.--Returned from a pleas-

ant tour of stumping with Governor Hartranft in Penn-

sylvania.  At the great meeting in Philadelphia--a procession

rather in honor of our Ohio victory--on the 21st, I rode in

[a] carriage with Governor Dix [of New York] and Governor

Hartranft. [On the] 22nd, spoke with Governor Hartranft in

fine hall of Columbia, in Lancaster County.





  [In the next few days Hayes spoke with Governor Hartranft

at Marietta, Mount Joy, Bethlehem, Sitzit, Ephard, Lancaster,

Easton, Allentown, Reading, Bellefonte, Johnstown, Franklin,

and Oil City. Everywhere he received much attention and

spoke to large throngs and with great effect, as contemporary

accounts show.  On more than one occasion mention was made

in his presence of the likelihood of his nomination for the

Presidency in the following year. Sunday, October 24, he was

entertained at the governor's mansion in Harrisburg and with

the governor, Senator Cameron, and Don Cameron visited the

home of Don Cameron.]



                       FREMONT, OHIO, November 1, 1875.

  MY DEAR GUY:--Thanks for your kind note.  I can agree

without qualification to all you say. I was so hurried to make

my canvass complete that I had no time to prepare speeches

after the first. It was my poorest, or one of the poorest. But

on the subject of the points in your letter, there was nothing

different from the one you saw.  Indeed, the last forty speeches

                         <B>(296)</B>









             <B>IN PENNSYLVANIA--OCTOBER, 1875          297</B>



were almost exclusively on the two questions--the money and

the schools or Catholics.

  My family are all well. Birch is at the law school in Cam-

 bridge.  Rud is at [the] Agricultural College of Michigan near

 Old Trow's [Trowbridge's] home.  Webb is at home running

our place.

                           Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

  GUY M. BRYAN,

       Texas.



                        FREMONT, OHIO, November 2, 1875.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Thanks for your letter of the 18th ult.

It came during my absence in Pennsylvania. At first I declined

to go, but they were so urgent that it would seem [have seemed]

churlish to refuse, and I yielded.

  I can't  realize  the "after-point"  [after-fruit].  There  is

enough of it [the possibility of obtaining the nomination for

the Presidency in 1876] brought to my notice in a multitude

of ways to make me think of it. I heard but little of it in Penn-

sylvania. It will perhaps die out with the subsidence of the

interest in the recent election. In any event, I mean not to mix

in it, or heed it; to go right along as if no such talk existed.

  I would particularly enjoy meeting Mr. Horton at your

house, and would push aside ordinary matters to do it, but al-

most four months of absence has piled up work which I can't

leave.

  I feel as you do that the future success of the Republicans

in Ohio and the Nation is exceedingly doubtful, with the pros-

pects of a national victory rather against us.

  We are all in our usual health.  If. at any time the next six

weeks, you can run up here with your wife, it will be a happi-

ness to us.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

      Cincinnati.

  November 3. -- Dispatch from Governor Hartranft, fifteen to

twenty thousand majority!

  Adversaries have said of me more good things than I deserve.

For example:  Vallandigham, October, 1867, in Cincinnati Com-

mercial -- jollification at Hamilton soon after election; Thurman,

in Senate after Pendleton's defeat, 1869; Colonel Burns,

letter in Enquirer, after Thurman's speech at Mansfield, 1875;

Governor Allen, at Findlay, July 6, 1875, and at Chillicothe after

his defeat, and June 10, 1875; [the Cincinnati] Enquirer on

my nomination, June, 1875.

  November 15, 1875. -- Birchard went to the law school at Cam-

bridge about the middle of October. Ruddy is at home from

the Agricultural School of Michigan. Webb, done with Cornell,

is running the business and stock at home.

  In a biography of Seward, it is said of him:  "He was not a

scholar, but he had scholarly tastes and aptitudes."  This is my

case.





                       FREMONT, OHIO, December 17, 1875.

  MY DARLING:--A doleful and lonely house this bright cold

morning.  Winnie was packed by Mary the day before, and yes-

terday morning we got her off about half-clothed--shoes in

her hand--pocket-book mislaid, etc., but in good condition for

her. Fanny will not be able to stand this a great while. She

looks very wistful and quiet. . . .  The pipes are not

frozen yet.

  We had an irruption of Western Reserve office-hunters in

the storm last night. Sent them off in good humor, if not

happy.

  Webb is now down trying to make coffee. He thinks he will

fail miserably, but I encourage him, and am not without hope.



  Love and anxious longing for your return.

                       Affectionately,

                                                  R. B. H.

  MRS. HAYES.

                        FREMONT, OHIO, December 22, 1875.

  MY DEAR GUY: -- Your kind letter of [the] 13th is before me.

Your views on public questions, I can subscribe to without im-

portant qualifications.  But this candidacy business, I feel is

another thing. I do not feel like severely censuring men of

commanding position, who have rendered large services, who

seek or seem to seek the Presidency. Our greatest statesmen

have committed that mistake. But for others, for mere avail-

abilities, to do it is unpardonable. My rule as governor was to

obey the Eleventh Commandment to the letter. I never alluded

even to general politics except when my State was to act on an

amendment to the National Constitution. To depart now would

be a mistake. On the proposed Constitutional Amendment of

Blaine, I might properly speak.

  A sty on one of my eyelids prevents me from writing with

comfort. I shall be glad to hear from you. I know your sound-

ness and friendship--if this thing becomes practical -- will be

of great value. The more I think of it, the less I desire it. In

any event, I must be passive.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  GUY M. BRYAN,

       Galveston.





  January 1, 1876. -- Yesterday and today the warmest winter

days remembered in this climate. Seventy degrees in the shade!

Sun bright and clear and spring-like. . . . I go to Colum-

bus to assume the governor's office soon; leave here the fourth.

  Columbus, January 13, 1876. -- Inaugurated governor third

time on the 10th, Monday. . . .  The weather cold and

windy, but bright. A handsome display of military. I speak of

inauguration day. Governor Allen and I rode together. He is

aged but full of spirits and vim. Talked cheerfully and well.

It all passed off pleasantly. Winnie, Rud, and Scott returned to-

day to Fremont.

                               COLUMBUS, January 15, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I shall in a few days send in the nominations

for the judicial commission. It was my preference to put your

name on the list. There has, however, been developed a divi-

sion of sentiment on the subject so strong in your part of the

State, that I have decided not to appoint any one in that quarter.

I regret this on many accounts, and especially because of the

disappointment of your wishes.  Hoping that you will appreciate

the situation, and my motives, I remain,

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE L. C. JONES,

      Warren, Ohio.

                               COLUMBUS, January  27, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I have your note of yesterday.  The

office of librarian is not to be vacant until a year from next

spring.

  You remember that if the Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans'

Home is reorganized, a head for that is to be found.  Do not

the same qualities count there as in the one named?  In a quiet

way you can speak of that, and apply the facts you get to the

analogous case. I have a reply like yours from Matthews also.

"Help" I may not need. I hope I shall not, but I am getting

ready.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.

                               COLUMBUS, January 29, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am greatly obliged for your letter of the

26th and gratified by its contents.<B>*</B> The only item I can give



<FONT SIZE="-1">  * Mr. Smith had written that General Sheridan approved of Senator

Sherman's letter, just made public, earnestly recommending the nomination

of Hayes. He analyzed the currents of party opinion in the Northwestern

States and wrote in conclusion:  "As to the situation in general:  The

ticket and platform should be of such character as to give the Re-

publicans New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, or the first two cer-

tainly.  This ticket would do it: Hayes and Wheeler."</FONT>

in return is that Judge Taft yesterday quite heartily and de-

cidedly expressed to me his wish and opinion in harmony with

yours.

  It seems to me so entirely the thing on all accounts to be

passive, that I am under no temptation to meddle. It now

looks as if this State would be a unit.--It is like old times to

see your handwriting in connection with such speculations.

  My best wishes to Mrs. Smith. -- Regards to General Sheri-

dan.

                          Sincerely,

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,                           R. B. HAYES.

      Chicago.

                              COLUMBUS, January 30, 1876.

  MY  DARLING:--Sunday morning, bright and cold, after a

week of rain and floods. Laura's party for the younger people

was a fine affair. . . .  I slipped over to Platt's and talked

finances with him the greater part of the evening.  "Aunt Loo"

much missed in all quarters.

  I am lonely without you.  Laura mourns your absence sin-

cerely.  General Mitchell has gone to Boston and New York;

returns in a week. Glad to be with Laura during his absence.

  Legislature and affairs going smoothly. Harrison, after con-

firmation, declines. But in a way to let me out of all respon-

sibility.  Have offered the place to Noble, Swan, Andrews, and

Scribner of Toledo.  None would take it.  Shall probably finally

get a Democrat of Coshocton, highly esteemed, Judge Sample.

  Watson wrote me a handsome letter and now I can properly

name him for common pleas judge vice Lane.  All of the bar

are committed by recommending him for the commission.  It is

only for a few months, and if he does not meet my hopes, no

harm will be done.

  The buzz [about the Presidency] rather grows, but does not

get beyond Ohio and Ohio people.  General Sheridan sends me

good words, and says his ticket is Hayes and Wheeler.  I am

ashamed to say, Who is Wheeler?

  You are getting on even faster than I am, as the inclosed

from Judge Thurman shows.  I do not know the paper but as-









<B>302          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



sume it is a Washington Democratic paper. "A second Mrs.

Madison"! But the word "second" will be an antidote for the

flattery of the rest of the paragraph. Let Webb put it in the

family scrapbook without cutting off the compliments of A. G.

Thurman. I hope you will sleep well after all this poison.

  Judge Taft would have called on you if you had been here

Friday. He is for the "fever" also heartily and frankly.

                     Affectionately ever,

                                                        H.

  MRS. HAYES.

      Fremont.





  Columbus, Ohio, February 1. -- [Senator] Sherman in his let-

ter on the Presidency says: "Hayes was not greatly distin-

guished in the army." This is perfectly true in the sense in

which Sherman intended it should be received. The rank of

General Hayes was major at the beginning of the war, and he

never rose above the command of a brigade and division. But in

his grade he was distinguished.

  1. He commanded the regiment which led the attack and

successfully opened the battle of South Mountain.

  2. He commanded the brigade which led the assault and

carried the works of the enemy in the fierce battle of Cloyd's

Mountain when the Rebel General Jenkins was defeated and

killed.

  3. He commanded one of the two brigades which covered

the retreat and saved Crook's army after the defeat at Win-

chester, July 24, 1864.

  4. He commanded one of the two brigades selected by Sheri-

dan to lead in repeated attacks on Early's lines in the Shenan-

doah Valley in August, 1864.

  5. He commanded one of the two brigades which fought at

Berryville, September 3, and by great gallantry saved the day.

  6. He commanded the brigade which led in the flank attack

which turned Early's left and defeated him in Sheridan's great

victory of Winchester, September 19, 1864.









             <B>THIRD TERM GOVERNOR--1876          303</B>



  7. He commanded the division which led up North Mountain

and routed Early in the victory at Fisher's Hill, September 22d,

1864.

  8. He commanded one of the divisions which retained its

organization and gained great distinction in the battle of Cedar

Creek, October 19, 1864.

  9. In more than fifty engagements, large and small, he was

always conspicuous for personal daring, self-possession, and

efficiency.

  That is a piece of talk that looks like brag, but I think it

does not overstate. Quote Comly on several occasions; the

language of my promotion to brigadier-general and brevet

major-general, etc., etc., and refer to Crook, Sheridan, etc., etc.

  Give the crossing of the slough at Winchester, September

19, 1864.

  Urged to leave the army in 1862 after his wound at South

Mountain, but declined to go into politics.

  In 1864 nominated for Congress and urged to come home

to take the stump. Reply. (Give it.)

  In 1865 nominated by Ohio Soldiers in the Shenandoah Valley

for governor.<B>*</B>





                               COLUMBUS, February 7, 1876.

  DEAR SIR:--I am much gratified to receive your esteemed

favor of the 24th. The good opinion and friendship of the men

of my old regiment with whom I served so long, I prize very

highly. I cannot forget them, and am glad to know that they are

not likely to forget me. My family are all in good health.

  With best wishes, I remain,

                           Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

                              COLUMBUS, February 9, 1876.

  MY  DARLING:--It seems to me you should arrange  to be

here at the Columbus party to the General Assembly. I send you

also the letter of George Jones. My ideas are not "sot" on the

latter. I probably go to the Soldiers' Home on that day. It is

a prior call.

  I have secured definitely the Hawkes House. You will do

well to come down on that account next week to see it and

arrange. We got down all very pleasantly.

                 Affectionately and sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. HAYES,

      Fremont.





                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 10, 1876.

  MY DEAR GUY: -- Thanks for your note.  I sent you the in-

augural also. The new duties are not unfamiliar, of course, but

the interruptions from various causes are much greater than

when I was here before.

  I know the sincerity of your advice, and I need not add that

I have confidence in your experience and judgment. The result

you desire [Hayes's nomination to the Presidency] is a possi-

bility, but, as I see it, not at all probable. It is gratifying to

find the people of Ohio so generally favorable. Beyond that I

am not looking for much.

                          Sincerely,

  GUY M. BRYAN,                                   R. B. HAYES.

  February 11.--My  first school-teacher, Mrs.  Joan Murray,

of Delaware, is to be buried today. If I can, I will go to the

funeral. She was an excellent woman. Her letter congratu-

lating me after the election, referring to my mother and sister,

touched me so that I could scarcely see to read.  A good woman

gone, another link broken  which connects me with the past in

Delaware.

             EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, STATE OF OHIO,

                             COLUMBUS, February 12, 1876.

  SIR:--I think it very important that General C. C. Walcutt

should be a member of the Board of Directors of the Ohio Peni-

tentiary.  His experience and other qualifications make his ap-

pointment especially desirable.  The  duties of the place will

occupy very little time and leave him ample opportunity to dis-

charge his duties to the general Government.       I therefore re-

quest that he be allowed to accept the place named without

losing his appointment as collector.

                        Respectfully,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  [TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY (?)]





  Tuesday, February 15. -- Since I came to Columbus six weeks

ago, there has been no day in which I have not had letters and

visits on the subject of my  nomination  for the Presidency.

Many days there is a succession of callers at my office on this

topic. I say very little. I have in no instance encouraged any

one to work to that end.  I have discountenanced all efforts at

organization or management in my  interest.  I have said the

whole talk about me is on the score of availability. Let avail-

ability do the work then.

  February 20.--Lucy came as I expected, took part in the

great affair at the City Hall, and in her pink or red silk looked

her best.  She went with me through the Dr. Hawkes house,

and has now returned to Fremont to receive Dr. Webb and

Aunt Anna and to bring down such things as she may need here.

  Friday I went with Judge Pugh to the Reform Farm near

Lancaster. Charges made against the gentleman in charge, Mr.

Howe, made it necessary to investigate; and after some time spent

in doing it, I have decided to reappoint Mr. Howe. It seems

to me a plain duty to do so.  I told Mr. Howe of the investiga-

tion and the result. He is somewhat sensitive about it, but on

the whole was not much out of the way.  Mrs. Howe is ac-

knowledged to be the right person for the place.

    20

  Some small matters in the institution should be attended to:--

1. Meteorological tables should be kept. It is a lofty region

said to be six hundred feet above the Hocking. 2. A telegraph

line should be built to Lancaster and the boys taught telegraph-

ing. 3. A narrow-gauge railroad should be run out there.

  Columbus, March 2, 1876.--With Lucy, Fanny, and Scott

came from Fremont yesterday. Found our man, the old soldier

Shermis, in possession of the new house, Dr. Hawkes' house,

number 60 East Broad Street, opposite State House, on north

side.

             EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, STATE OF OHIO,

                                 COLUMBUS, March 4, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I have your note of the second. I am

kept busy with callers, correspondence, and the routine details

of the office, and have not, therefore, tried to keep abreast of

the currents of opinion on any of the issues. My notion is that

the true contest is to be between inflation and a sound currency;

that the Democrats are again drifting all to the wrong side.

We need not divide on details, on methods, or time when.

The previous question will again be irredeemable paper as a

permanent policy, or a policy which seeks a return to coin. My

opinion is decidedly against yielding a hair's breadth.

  We can't be on the inflation side of the question. We must

keep our faces firmly in the other direction. "No steps back-

ward" must be something more than unmeaning platform words.

  "The drift of sentiment among our friends in Ohio," which

you inquire about, will depend on the conduct of our leading

men. It is for them to see that the right sentiment is steadily

upheld. We are in a condition such that firmness and adherence

to principle are of peculiar value just now. I would "consent"

to no backward steps. To yield or compromise is weakness,

and will destroy us. If a better resumption measure can be sub-

stituted for the present one, that may do. But keep cool. We

can better afford to be beaten in Congress than to back out.

  I do not write letters to be shown, or used in any way, on









             <B>"NO STEPS BACKWARD"--MARCH, 1876          307</B>



political questions, but this much I may say to you. Do not

quote me.

  I note what you say on the personal aspect of our politics,

and assure you that I feel the compliment implied very sensibly.

  Our kindest regards to Mrs. Garfield.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL J. A. GARFIELD,

      Washington.

Private.

                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, March 9, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your note of the 6th is received. We are

no doubt entering on a doubtful political contest. Whoever may

be the candidate, his election can only be secured by "solid work."

Both parties are injured by what is going on at Washington.

Both are, therefore, more and more disposed to look for can-

didates outside of that atmosphere. It is very gratifying, what-

ever may be the event, to be so heartily supported by the men

with whom I served.

  I do not wish my friends to do any pushing. I shall con-

tinue to avoid everything of the sort.

  All of my family feel that we are bound to the Twenty-third

men by the strongest ties.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  CAPTAIN D. K. SMITH,

      Mentzville, Missouri.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, March 20, 1876.

  MY DEAR TOM:--You are more political than I supposed.

  On good terms with Waite for many years, I am yet not a

correspondent, and can't give his "true inwardness" from recent

information. He has published a letter which has been ac-

cepted by his best friends in Ohio as taking his name out of the

possible men, and I imagine that such is the fact. It will be

time lost to undertake to change his purpose now. Bristow

is a good man, and growing in public favor.  Why not take him?









<B>308          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  You do Lincoln injustice. Many years before Lincoln's term

the Senatorial control of patronage had grown up. Douglas

had made himself great by it.

  All this matter of Waite's candidacy was talked up some

months ago, and has been regarded as settled since before the

holidays.

                          [Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.]

  T. D. H--.

                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, March 20, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--There cannot be the least danger that our

committee will be so weak as to lean towards unsoundness on

the money question. I have heard no one suggest that we should

be less explicit than we were last year, and my preference de-

cidedly is, that, if we change, it be in the direction of resump-

tion.  My views are so exactly expressed in your note that I

do not enlarge.  If consulted, I shall advise accordingly.  But

do come out [to the convention] if practicable.  I am confident

we shall be sound as coin.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.





  [Mr. Sherman had written from Washington, March 18:--

"There is great fear here that the Ohio Republican Convention

will follow to some extent the example of the Indiana Conven-

tion by adopting a platform on the currency question that is not

sound and square in favor of specie resumption.  If so it would

be a fatal mistake. . . . The approval of our platform of

last year would do, but anything less than that will defeat us

in several of the Republican  States.       We  cannot afford to

demagogue with the Democracy on this question.  Garfield tells

me that our position on the currency question and the reactionary

tendency of the 'Confederate House' saved us in New Hamp-

shire.  I write you in the hope that your influence will be ex-

erted to avoid the danger I refer to.  We are right now on the









             <B>DISCUSSED FOR PRESIDENT--MARCH, 1876          309</B>



currency question, and ought not to show signs of weakness.

I have been urged to attend the convention on the 29th instant,

but it is hardly probable my duties here will permit; and my

opinions are so well known that my presence might invite an-

tagonism; but I do hope that you and others interested in the

result of the convention will guard against this danger."]







  March 21, 1876.  Columbus. -- The last week a large number

of the counties have elected delegates to the State Convention.

Several counties have not expressed a preference on the Presi-

dential [candidate], but the most of them have passed resolu-

tions in favor of me. It is likely that all of the counties have

sent delegates who are favorable. Certainly, none are avowedly

opposed. There is a sentiment for Bristow as a second choice.

His war on the whiskey thieves gives him prestige as the repre-

sentative of reform. I am not sure but he would be the best

candidate we could nominate. I am sure I prefer him to any

other man. It will be a small disappointment for me to give

up my chances.  With so general an expression in my favor in

Ohio and a fair degree of assent elsewhere, especially in States

largely settled by Ohio people, I have supposed it was possible

that I might be nominated.

  But with no opportunity, and no desire, to make combinations,

or to lay wires, I have not thought my chance worth much con-

sideration.  I feel less diffidence in thinking of this subject than,

perhaps, I ought.  It seems to me that good purposes and the

judgment, experience, and firmness I possess, would enable me

to execute the duties of the office well.  I do not feel the least

fear that I should fail.  This all looks egotistical, but it is

sincere.

  On the other hand, I do not desire the place with any strong

or uneasy feeling. I shall accept the result which now seems

probable without any bitterness. If Bristow is nominated, I

shall give him hearty support in speeches and otherwise.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, March 31, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- It is, I am sure, not needed, but I wish to say

it was the general wish that you should be at the head of the

state delegation. I am confident your name would have been

placed there by acclamation if it had not been withdrawn. I

regret that you are not there.

  On the subject of the currency, you will see that we did

pretty well. I preferred a still more decided expression, and

the committee would have carried it overwhelmingly. But the

desire to have perfect unanimity softened the resolution some-

what. Upon the whole your speech is endorsed squarely.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

       Washington.



                                  COLUMBUS, April 1, 1876.

  MY DEAR MAJOR: -- Thanks for your attention to the asylum

affair.

  The convention mishaps are merely a momentary annoyance.

Sherman was the only man I felt at liberty to commend, and

I was certainly disappointed at the action in his case. But it

will be understood by all who wish to understand it. Others

can't be pleased by anything.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  W. D. BICKHAM,

      Dayton.





  April 2.--On the 29th ult., the Republican State Convention

of seven hundred and fifty delegates was held. It declared by a

unanimous vote that I was the choice of the Republicans of

Ohio for President. They instructed the senatorial delegates

and requested the district delegates "to use their earnest efforts

to secure his [my] nomination." This is certainly very flatter-

ing. It was done with enthusiasm and in earnest.









             <B>OHIO INSTRUCTS FOR HAYES-MARCH, 1876          311</B>



  From the beginning I have done nothing, directly or indirectly,

to bring about this result. I have discouraged rather than en-

couraged "the Hayes movement."

  And now for the future. I would be glad if now I could in

some satisfactory way drop out of the candidacy. I do not at

present see what I can do to relieve myself from the embarrass-

ment of the position I am in. It does not greatly disturb me.

My usual serenity carries me along. But I would like to be out

of it. I will think of it.



                             COLUMBUS, OHIO, April 2, 1876.

  MY DEAR GUY:--Your letter of the 24th ult. and its en-

closures came duly.

  I am now at the end of one stage of this political business.

Without word or act of mine, the Ohio convention with absolute

unanimity instructed for me. This, of course, is a gratifying

endorsement. I have rather discouraged "the Hayes movement"

from the first. I now would be glad to be satisfactorily out of it.

But I suppose I shall continue a silent looker-on.

  Nothing in the whole affair has given me more satisfaction

than your feeling about it. I have letters from many old school-

fellows, and every mail brings words from old fellow soldiers.

All this is pleasant.  But, etc., etc., etc. . . .

                           As ever,

  GUY M. BRYAN,                                             R.

             EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, STATE OF OHIO,

                                   COLUMBUS, April 6, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am exceedingly obliged for your very satis-

factory letter. A press of business has prevented an earlier

reply.

  Having done absolutely nothing to make myself the candidate

of Ohio, I feel very little responsibility for the future results.

When the State Convention was called it seemed probable that,

if I encouraged my friends to organize for the purpose, every

district would elect my decided supporters. But to make such









<B>312          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



an effort in my own behalf, to use Payne's phrase on repudia-

tion, "I abhorred."

  Being now in the field without any act of my own, I have

no uneasy ambition to remain a candidate. I think I have a

right, however, to considerate treatment at the hands of the

Ohio delegation. If I am to be voted for at all, and as long as

I am to be voted for at all, may I not reasonably expect the

solid vote of the State? Whenever any considerable number

of the delegation thinks the time has come to withdraw my

name, it ought to be promptly done. I can speak of this, I think,

with a judgment as impartial as if it were the case of another

man. I am not solicitous to be a candidate for nomination, nor

for the nomination itself.

  I agree with you that Mr. Blaine's course with you was very

handsome.

  You may show this note, if you wish, to Mr. Garretson, but

it is, of course, not for publication.

                          Sincerely.

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--I am very glad the asylum appointments are satis-

factory.

  EDWIN COWLES,

                  EXECUTIVE MANSION, STATE OF OHIO,

                                 COLUMBUS, April 7, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am greatly shocked and astonished by the

contents of your note of the 5th inst. I would, of course, never

think of making an appointment of such a man as you describe

General R-- to be.

  The law unfortunately required four institutions to be organ-

ized in five days from its passage, and I did not get the law for

two days.  In the hurry, mistakes have been made.  The nomi-

nation is confirmed.  I will try to find a remedy.  I regret ex-

ceedingly this thing.    I knew  R--  as a gallant soldier--

wounded--a Democrat--and well recommended to me.

  In the hurry of the closing days of the session I am compelled









             <B>APPOINTMENTS AND PARDONS--1876          313</B>



to be brief. I am mortified, but feel that I am more sinned

against than sinning in this affair.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  [Unidentified.]                



  April 11, 1876. -- I have made the last appointments for this

session of the Legislature. Some mistakes have been made, but,

on the whole, I have been fortunate. One or two things, I must

bear in mind.  No man should be finally determined on until

the people where he resides have been heard from, after he is

seriously talked of, or nominated for the place.  The saying,

that "no man knows what can be said against him until he is a

candidate for office," has a wise side to it. I named a Democrat

of excellent character for trustee of Dayton Hospital for the

Insane. Straightway it appeared he had been a bitter Copper-

head during the war. Another, a gallant soldier and fine gentle-

man, was no sooner named than it was notorious that he was a

shameless libertine.

  The pardon record makes a good deal of perplexing labor.

Some rules:--

  1. Grant no pardon and make no promises on the first pre-

sentation of a case. Take time before deciding, or even en-

couraging the party.

  2. If two or more are concerned in the crime, consider the

cases of all together. One is often called the dupe until he is

pardoned; then the other becomes dupe, and the pardoned man

the leader.

  3. Pardon no man who is not provided with employment or

the means of subsistence.

  4. Pardon no man unless some friend is ready to receive

him as he comes from the prison.

  5. Of course the judge, the prosecuting attorney, and some

intelligent citizen of sound sense should be heard from in all

cases.

  These rules may be departed from in cases requiring it, but

let them always be considered before the pardon is granted

or any committal had.

  In politics I am growing more indifferent. I would like it,

if I could now return to my planting and books at home.

  MY DEAR MRS. DAVIS:--Greatly obliged for N--'s [Nord-

confesses that N-'s good words do bring to her soul a serenity

like the consciousness of being well dressed.

  I am not in that "local folly" known as the Hayes movement,

and am sorry N- allows himself to be deluded.

  Our darlings are all in usual health. We do long for the

open-air life of Fremont, and would gladly return to the grove.

  Our best wishes and regards to the doctor.

                             COLUMBUS, OHIO, April 22, 1876.

   DEAR GENERAL:--I am in receipt of your favor of the 19th

 with the accompanying letter. The statements made by Messrs.

 Rhodes, Palmer, Evart, and other gentlemen correspond pre-

 cisely with the impression I had when I sent your nomination

to the Senate. At the time of the difficulty I wrote in regard

to it as follows: -- [Quotation not given.]

   I have also a full and strong letter from Mr. Woodbridge

 giving the same views with those of the gentlemen. I regret

exceedingly what has happened, and especially that your feelings

should have been wounded in an affair in which your name was

used without any act of your own. Your letter is so admirable

in all respects that it increases my vexation as I consider my

own part in it. My explanation will, however, I am sure, be

satisfactory to you.

  The act under which you were appointed required four hos-

pitals for the insane to be organized, with twenty appointments

in all parts of the State, in five days from its passage. I did

not get a copy of the act, or know of this provision until after

two of the five days had elapsed. What I ought to have done

was to notify the General Assembly that the time was too short

to make the appointments, and to request an immediate exten-

sion of the time. Attempting to comply with the law, this un-

fortunate result has followed.

  I beg to assure you that I regret very much this occurrence,

and am very glad to believe that in the result no permanent or

serious injury will be done to you.

                          [Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.]

  [Unidentified.]

                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, April 23, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I hardly know what to think of the affair

you detail in your favor of the 18th.<B>*</B> It is probable, as I now

see it, that it will be damaging as you anticipate. In any event,

<B>316          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



I am glad that no man who is taking an interest in the Hayes

movement has had a hand in bringing it out. Nothing is gained

by pulling down, and if there was, let it be done by somebody

else. Fortunately I am still a mere looker-on--"as serene and

calm as a summer morning" (Greiner's song).

  Under increased obligations,

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

      Chicago.

                             COLUMBUS, OHIO, April 23, 1876.

  MY DEAR GUY:--I have your letter of the 18th and the en-

closed copy of a note to Norton, [editor of a paper at Dallas and

a delegate to the Cincinnati convention]. I hardly know how

to tell you the pleasure it gave me. I am, if possible, less solici-

tous about this affair than I was before the Ohio convention.  It

will be rather a relief to be left out at Cincinnati. Certainly, it

will be no disappointment, and there will be no soreness about it.

But such talk as yours, although I know it is not merited, is

very pleasant.

  It is probable that Norton will publish it. But is it not best that

your name be left off? It is one of the very few things I would

feel like publishing here. My rule and preference, however, is

to do absolutely nothing to favor the movement in behalf of

my nomination. I mean to keep this path to the end. I see it

stated that "even Hayes had friends attending to his interests

in the conventions of Virginia and South Carolina." This is

wholly untrue, so far as any act or knowledge of mine is con-

cerned. Very few Republicans in Ohio are so completely out

of the Hayes movement as I am.

  The invitation to the opening of the Centennial [Exposition]

on May 10 is to all governors and all members of state boards.

As I come under both heads, it is possible I may feel constrained

to go.  But I do not expect to make my stay in Philadelphia

until after the Cincinnati convention emancipates me from the

bondage of candidacy. But any time during July and August

I can go with you, and will enjoy doing so. You can visit me









             <B>"A MERE LOOKER-ON"--MAY, 1876          317</B>



here as long as you choose before or after going, greatly to our

mutual enjoyment.  We are all well.

                          As ever,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

     Galveston.



                           COLUMBUS, OHIO, April 26, 1876.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--I have your letter on the pardon case.

The facts you mention are important, and I shall give them full

consideration.

  Also your articles. Too laudatory and friendly. You must

also see that, as I well know, some of my best friends are Bris-

tow men. If others lose temper, we must not. Your idea of

keeping in position to support the nominee without anything

to recall, or to give aid to the common adversary, is the sound

thing.

                          Sincerely,

  MAJOR W. D. BICKHAM,                           R. B. HAYES.

      Dayton.

                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 3, 1876.

  MY DEAR JUDGE:--Returning after a few days' absence at

Fremont, I find your letters of the 27th and 29th.

  You evidently understand the situation as well as any one

who is writing or talking on the subject. You are unquestion-

ably correct in assuming that your Eastern correspondent is not

personally acquainted with me. Having thus far avoided all

complications, committals, direct or indirect,--having, in short,

been a mere looker-on as you are,--I do not now expect to

change my course or to give assurances of any sort. Your con-

jectures or views, as given in the copy, show plainly enough

that you understand me so well that for your satisfaction nothing

from me is required.

  You speak of management by my friends securing results. I

think I can see that part of it impartially. If anything depends

on management, I suspect my chances may be put down at zero.

The best I can look for, is that the march of events may be









<B>318          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



allowed to go along undisturbed by friendly management either

wise or otherwise.

  In any event, your letters interest me and oblige me. I class

you, as a political writer, with our best men. With good health,

you would, if you had chosen that path, [have] ranked with

George William Curtis and our other great political writers (if

there are others abreast of Mr. Curtis), but God disposes.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE W. M. DICKSON,

      Cincinnati.



Private.

                             COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 4, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--In reply to your note of the first, I regret

as you do the rejection of Mr. Dana.  It was a great wrong.

The senator, representing the Republicans of Ohio, voted for

Mr. Dana's confirmation. If he had voted otherwise I should

certainly try to change his views. My relations, however, to the

other gentlemen you name are not such that I feel at liberty

to take the course you suggest.

  I trust that the people of your State will find in the National

Convention ample reason for remaining true to the old faith.

I feel confident that in the next canvass we shall have a ticket

and platform that will give the desired assurance that the spirit

you complain of will be banished from the next Republican

Administration.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE C. H. HILL.



  May 7.--The Ohio friends think our prospect at Cincinnati

grows daily better. General Garfield writes me the following,

which I prize more than the prospects of success, -- if I can con-

tinue to deserve it: --

  "I repeat with more emphasis than before, what I said in my

last letter to you, that we are all delighted with the sensible and

masterful way in which you are bearing yourself during the









             <B>GARFIELD'S COMMENDATION--MAY, 1876          319</B>



chaotic period of President making. You are gaining strength

every day with our most thoughtful people."

  To which I reply: -- "I value the compliment in your closing

paragraph. It has been my desire to deserve it. Not to lose

my head and to get through without doing or saying anything

unjust or even uncharitable towards competitors or their sup-

porters, has been my ambition in this business. If I am suc-

cessful in this, the adverse result which I anticipate will not

give me a moment's uneasiness."



                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 17, 1876.

  DEAR SIR:--Herewith are requisitions for arms and am-

munition somewhat beyond the amount now due to Ohio. But I

am told that they are not beyond the amount we shall be en-

titled to within a few weeks when the appropriations are made.

It is of much importance that we have the arms, etc., now. I

trust you will see your way clear to direct that we get them.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE ALPHONSO TAFT,

       Washington.

                                  COLUMBUS, May 17, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I am glad you agree with me as to

the treatment of the mining riots. We shall crush out the law-

breakers if the courts and juries do not fail. Thanks for the

books. The first installment is at hand.

  A very bright and excellent young man, William P. Goodwin

of Cleveland, wants a lieutenancy in the army and wants me

to commend him to you, which I do very heartily and unre-

servedly.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE J. A. GARFIELD.



  May 19. --Nothing new in the political way of special per-

sonal interest. I still think Blaine is so far ahead in the number









<B>320          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



of delegates he has secured and is securing that his nomination

is not improbable. He has not been greatly damaged by the in-

vestigations. As a candidate before the people, his newly ac-

quired wealth, his schemes for getting the nomination, and his

connection with the money interests depending for success on

legislation, will damage him.  But with two or three hundred

delegates in his favor, will not all of the loose odds and ends

gravitate to him? It so seems.  If he fails, the next [probability]

is a combination for selfish ends to make a candidate among the

friends of the leading candidate. This would not be in my favor.

My independent position, aloof from bargaining, puts me outside

of the list from whom the managers will select. It is only in

the contingency of a union between those who look for avail-

ability in the candidate and those who are for purity and reform

in administration, that I am a probable nominee.



                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 19, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--It would specially gratify me if you would

attend the Cincinnati convention. I do not mean to depart from

the position I have taken--to remain perfectly passive on the

nomination. But it is fair to assume that the time may come

when I ought to be withdrawn.  To be able to act on this and

other possible questions, it is important for me that I have

friends of experience and sound judgment on the ground, by

whom I can be advised of the exact condition of things and of

the proper course to be taken. I have consulted with the dele-

gate from my own district and town, General Buckland, more

fully than with any other member of the delegation, and regard

him as a friend in whom I can confide unreservedly.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



  May 21.--I have a friendly note of the 18th from [the]

Secretary of War, Judge Taft, in which he says:--"I am no

prophet in such confused elements of calculation, but it really

seems to me that your chances are stronger than those of any









             <B>SERENE ABOUT CANDIDACY--MAY, 1876          321</B>



other man. I mean that taking into view such elements of cal-

culation as exist and are appreciable, the probabilities are in your

favor. . . . I should feel that it was another strong point

gained for Ohio, if it should come to you."

  Judge Dickson (W. M.) of Cincinnati, asked me a question or

two put to him by an Eastern correspondent. I replied. It

turns out the correspondent was George William Curtis. Judge

Dickson now sends me the reply of Curtis to his (the judge's)

note sending my letter.  [Curtis writes]:--". . .  I have

read it [Hayes's letter], you will easily believe, with very great

interest. . . .  That it is the reply to a letter so frank as

you state yours to have been, is only the more agreeable, for it

places him in a most manly and simple position.

  "His chances seem to me daily to improve, for the feeling

among the friends of other candidates is becoming so positive

that I feel as if some compromise were probable. . . ."

  May 26, 1876. -- Bought of young Randall at his book store on

High Street, west side, south of State, this book and begin a

new diary volume.

  I am now living quietly, as governor, at 60 East Broad street,

opposite the State House Square, in a furnished house rented

of Dr. W. B. Hawkes. My family are Lucy, Fanny, and

Scott. Winnie, assisted about half the time by Cora, does our

housework. I rise between five and seven, write letters until

breakfast at 8:30; am at my office until about 1 P. M., from 9

A. M.; dine about 2 P. M.; at office again until after 5 P. M.;

and evenings for calls and callers. Too little exercise is the only

fault with it. I am in good health, weigh about one hundred

and eighty [pounds].

  My thoughts are on the political situation a good deal, and yet

not anxiously or uneasily. It is certain that my own conduct

and character are pretty well understood, and I see no reason

to apprehend that I shall fail to pass creditably through the

ordeal of candidacy.  Whatever the event, my head is likely

to remain level.

  A few days ago I was interviewed by a [New York] Herald

reporter. I said enough to induce him, as I hoped, not to pub-

    21









<B>322          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



lish as an interview what I was saying. But in this morning's

Journal I see extracts from his letter, showing that with reason-

able fidelity he has given my talk.

  I received a letter from the secretary of the Republican Re-

form Club, asking for publication my opinions on the declara-

tion of principles issued by the club. I could very heartily

subscribe to the declaration in all of its parts; indeed I am in

print fully and explicitly in favor of the coin resolution, and the

resolution on civil service reform. As to the economy talk, and

the resolution about candidates, all parties profess the same

thing. But not wishing to write a letter for publication I sent

the following:--



Private.

                           COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 25, 1876.

  DEAR SIR: -- I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of

your letter, asking for publication my views on certain important

political questions.

  You are aware that my name has been mentioned in connection

with the nominations to be made next month at Cincinnati.

Having thus far done nothing with the purpose of promoting

my own nomination by that convention, I prefer not to change

my course of conduct either by the publication of letters on

political questions or otherwise. I must, therefore, respectfully

decline to write to you anything for publication as requested in

your esteemed favor of the 22d instant.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MR. GOUVERNEUR CARR,

       SECRETARY.



                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 31, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am growing more indifferent to the result

as the time of decision approaches. This makes it easy for me

to keep myself clear of complications. You have noticed the

Boston Herald talk of my preference for Blaine. The whole

paragraph is a sheer fabrication. John Q. Smith, the supposed









             <B>SERENE ABOUT CANDIDACY--MAY, 1876          323</B>



authority for the statement, writes me that he said nothing of

the sort.

  My correspondents all give the same flattering report. Sinister

news doesn't reach me. I am pleased to think I am so un-

touched by this whole business. I say to the Ohio delegates

that my name ought not to be thought of unless it will promote

harmony and the prospect of success; that it should be with-

drawn the moment the condition of things makes it, in their

judgment, desirable.

  Still under obligations, I am,

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

       Chicago,



Private.

                                  COLUMBUS, June 3, 1876.

  DEAR SIR:--I always give heed to such letters as those you

have written on the pardon of Wilder. It is proper to say that

I had a very large number of letters from clergymen, lawyers,

merchants, and others acquainted with Wilder, just prior to his

crime, in his own town, showing that he bore an excellent char-

acter. That his crime was the result of a mere drunken frenzy

and that he ought to be pardoned was stated to me in writing

by (the mayor of Cincinnati verbally) the chief of police, the

jurors, the prosecutor, the judge, the girl who was shot at, and

other respectable citizens. The case made was an exceedingly

good one.  But of more importance than that, he was pardoned

on condition -- the condition that he should wholly abstain from

liquor. This condition has probably been broken. If so, steps

will be taken to return him to the penitentiary to serve out his

sentence.                  Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MR. G. V. STEVENSON.



 June 10. -- The members and others interested are assembling

at Cincinnati preparatory for the convention. Up to this time,

the course of the canvass, so far as I am concerned, has been









<B>324          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



agreeable.  My friends have been quiet.  Those of other can-

didates have generally treated me well.  The Vice-Presidency

seems to be conceded to me on all sides, or nearly so. I have

seen evidences of a desire to give me the second place on the

ticket from Conkling, Blaine, and Bristow men.  Morton is so

near to us that it would hardly do for his friends to suggest an

Ohio candidate for Vice, and yet even they occasionally suggest

[it].  The balloting among the readers of the New York Wit-

ness, a Presbyterian paper of large circulation, puts me at the

head of the poll for Vice-President. This is all flattering and

gratifying. However, the thoughts of my friends are on the

first place.  My chances there are merely probabilities.  Yet,

there are some encouraging facts.  I seem to be the second

choice of many of the leading supporters of other candidates--

ex-Vice-President Hamlin, of Maine, President White (A. D.),

of New York, and others.





                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, June 12, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I have just read with the deepest sorrow of

your illness. My eyes are almost blinded with tears as I write.

All good men among your countrymen will pray, as I do, for

your immediate and complete recovery.  This affects me as did

the death of Lincoln.  God bless you and restore you.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JAMES G. BLAINE.



                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, June 14, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--The indications, as I now read them,

point to the nomination of Blaine on the first or some early bal-

lot. My sympathies have been very greatly excited by his recent

misfortune, and by his pluck in the fearful contest he has gone

through.  But I feel that his nomination would be fatal to the

cause.  I do not see how we can get through in Ohio with him

at the head of our ticket. It is proposed to put me in the second

place. This will not help the case. It is the man at the head

who makes the canvass. I have the greatest aversion to being









             <B>CINCINNATI CONVENTION--JUNE, 1876          325</B>



a candidate on the ticket with a man whose record as an upright

public man is to be in question -- to be defended from the be-

ginning to the end.  I do not care about defeat if associated

with such men as Fish, Morgan, Washburne, etc., etc.

  All this you fully understand. I therefore have sent you a

letter directed to the chairman of the delegation, Governor

Noyes, to be delivered to him in the event of the nomination of

Blaine, authorizing and requesting him to withdraw my name,

if it is proposed, in connection with the Vice-Presidency. Of

course, I do not wish to injure Blaine by making any personal

allusion to him.  I deeply sympathize with him in his present

calamity--a calamity, I suspect, which is far more serious than

is reported, and I would not lessen his chances or that of the party

by any word disparaging to him.  I therefore beg you to see

that this letter is kept by you with the utmost care to prevent

a violation of confidence.  Please hand the enclosed to Governor

Noyes if the contingency occurs. Otherwise keep it and return

it to me. If you are advised of anything important for me to

know, let me have it by telegraph.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Make no allusion to this note and what is said of

Blaine, even to Noyes, or to any other intimate friend.

  GENERAL R. P. BUCKLAND.



(Telegram.)

                       COLUMBUS, June 15, 1876. 10 A. M.

TO GENERAL BUCKLAND,

      Cincinnati.

  You know my views about the Vice-Presidentcy.  Do what you

think best.

                                              R. B. HAYES.





  June 16, 1876.  Friday, 8  A. M. -- This is the third day of the

convention at Cincinnati.  My friends were there a week ago

tonight.  One whole week of convention work.  At the ad-









<B>326          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



journment last night, all was ready to begin the balloting. At

ten this morning the decisive balloting begins. Early in the

struggle, my friends were very hopeful. But on the 13th, Blaine

became decidedly the prominent man--his prospects deemed

almost a certainty. There has been a gradual change on the

14th and 15th, and now it seems something more than a possi-

bility that he will fail.

  If he fails, my chance, as a compromise candidate, seems to

be better than that of any other candidate. So, we are now in

suspense. I have kept cool and unconcerned to a degree that

surprises me. The same may be said of Lucy. I feel that

defeat will be a great relief--a setting free from bondage.

The great responsibility overpowers me. That is too strong. It

sobers me. It is a weight, but not overpowering. I shall try

to do in all things, more than ever before, if nominated, pre-

cisely the thing that is right, to be natural, discreet, wise, moder-

ate, and as firm in the right as it is possible for me to be. And

in this spirit I await the event!

  Sunday, June 18. -- I have had no time to write since my nomi-

nation, on the seventh ballot, about 4 P. M. on the 16th, Friday.

Friday has been a lucky day for me  before.          My  deepest

emotions were on receiving Blaine's dispatch of congratulation.

It for a few moments quite unmanned me. And then Shoe-

maker's dispatch, wishing that Uncle Birchard was alive.





                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, June 19, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I trust you will never regret the important

action you took in the inauguration and carrying out of the

movement which resulted in my nomination. I write these few

words to assure you that I appreciate and am grateful for what

you did.

  My kindest regards to Mrs. Sherman.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.









             <B>NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT--JUNE, 1876          327</B>



                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, June 19, 1876.

  MY DEAR S--:--It was always so.  The men you want to

see don't come--don't even dispatch or write. Well, I know

it all the same.  As Pope said:  "You know how I feel about it."

  I now write merely to say that I am grateful to you, and that

your sagacity in this matter, take it all in all, is beyond that of

any other friend. I will get the date of the letter in which you

named the ticket. It was early--very. And the way it was to

come you told to a letter. Others of much sagacity have written,

but nothing like yours.    Not merely sagacity either!  How

much you did to fulfill the prediction I shall perhaps never

know, but I know it was very potent. -- Our love to Mrs.

Smith.                     Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



  [Replying, June 21, Mr. Smith wrote at length, giving de-

tails of the skillful activities of the Ohio delegates at Cincinnati.

Of himself he said:--

  "I had returned home and enjoyed one good night's rest when

your generous favor of the 19th instant came to hand. The las-

situde which followed the exciting labors of the week at once

disappeared, and I could not but congratulate myself on having

omitted letters and dispatches, inasmuch as such omission as-

sured me such kindly remembrance in your hour of triumph--

a remembrance that has added a most precious link to our golden

chain of friendship. It has afforded me the liveliest satisfaction.

  "I do not wish to speak of myself further than this: The

satisfaction I derived from your nomination was not altogether

traceable to friendship.   There was more  involved.      In the

moment of triumph I did not feel so much like throwing my hat

'pretty high,' as some of our newspaper friends alleged, as I did

like returning then and there grateful thanks to an Allwise

Providence for having given us the victory and thus once more

rendered possible the triumph of the Republican party and peace

to the country. Thus you see that I believe you are charged

with a great mission, and may God give you strength to the

end."]
