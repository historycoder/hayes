   MAY 4, 1873.--I went to Lima yesterday by the Lake Erie

      and Louisville Railroad and there met Lucy and Scott

Russell. . . .     We now are here for good.  My return to

Fremont after an absence of over twenty-four years is exceed-

ingly pleasant. I can now be useful to my town, neighbors, and

friends. There is a general feeling of pleasure at my return.



                             FREMONT, OHIO, May 11, 1873.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--. . . Our plunder all came from Colum-

bus yesterday. It filled a car and a half. We loaded it into our

storehouse -- my future library and office, -- and there it is for

you and Birch to revel in when you come home. We shall be

obliged to unpack some boxes now but we shall try to leave some

for your skill to be exerted on.

  I have put out about the garden-house apple, pear, and cherry

trees--one dozen of each. We have put evergreens in the triangle

park, and lengthened the line of elms largely; willows around

the spring, and I hope to have sycamores around the pond in the

corner of the grove.

  Enclosed is one-third for the "freshy" and two-thirds for the

afflicted-in-the-head junior.

                       Affectionately,

                                                        H.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

      Ithaca.



  May 18, 1873. -- My friend, John W. Herron, speaks of the

fine meeting the bar of Cincinnati had on the occasion of Chase's

death, and of his disgust with the State Bar meeting at Columbus.

                         <B>(242)</B>









             <B>RETURN TO FREMONT--MAY, 1873          243</B>



I reply that the coldness of the state meeting had honesty in it,

and that the eulogy of the Cincinnati meeting was hardly sincere.

[I said further]:--

  "Chase possessed noble gifts of intellect, great culture, and a

commanding presence. When this is said, about all that is favor-

able has been said. He was cold, selfish, and unscrupulous. His

conduct to Lincoln and Stanton, his willingness to sacrifice party

and friends to gain place, his disregard of principle on many oc-

casions, and his contempt for the great office he held and his

willingness to degrade it, should have made lawyers, at least,

chary of praise. I have heard him speak of himself and associates

on the bench as like old women, and he always preferred the

title of Governor to that of Chief Justice. He often expressed

preference for the place of Senator to that of Chief Justice.

Political intrigue, love of power, and a selfish and boundless am-

bition were the striking features of his life and character."

  June 2. -- I have now got my library building in a sort of order.

My books have suffered some by transportation, but it is pleasant

to have them again in sight.





                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 6, 1873.

  MY DEAR WEBB: -- Your description and diagram of the town

library [of Ithaca], building, shelving, etc., etc., is very good --

easily understood and could, I think, be followed by a carpenter

here without trouble.

  Now as to books:  Number?  What are most read?  Say, the

best six authors? How many copies of the most popular books

do they keep?  Have they a published catalogue?

  One other thing about the shelves: How deep are they through

from front to back, or front to front, for both sides are fronts,

and what sort of stuff are they made of?

                          Sincerely,

                                                          H.

  WEBB C. HAYES.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, June 12, 1873.

  DEAR WEBB: -- We have just heard of the death of your Uncle,

Dr. James D. Webb, at Carthage, in the asylum. He has been

gradually growing worse for several weeks. We shall go with

Ruddy down to the funeral tomorrow. It is a sad termination

of his life, but after we knew that there was organic disease of

the brain, it has been the only possible result. No time to write

further.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  WEBB C. HAYES.



  Fremont, June 21.--I was a little startled this morning by

finding that a cough brought up blood,  . . .  but enough to

set me to thinking. I have had a hacking cough, sometimes for

several minutes in the night, during the last five or six weeks.

If I sit with my hat off in the wind I find I am taking cold. It

may be I will [shall] go like Pease.  Practical suggestions:

Read up Hall and get ready for the worst.  Hall and travel to

the dry regions to prevent; and get out of debt and settle affairs

for the other event.

  July 2. -- Lucy reads in the new office daily aloud Mrs. Stowe's

"Old Town Folks" with great unction to the boys, who rest from

their labors and laugh and listen in a comfortable way. It is

very jolly. As good as a play. She says the good grandmother

is like her grandmother Lucy Ware Webb.  She (Lucy Ware

Webb) was a generous, warm-hearted woman. Grandfather

Webb was small, rather testy, not mean, but disposed to criticize

his wife's liberality.  "On one occasion Mother Webb heard a

scene between the old people.  Grandmother Webb had filled a

basket with good things for the preacher-she was very liberal, to

preachers in particular--and then called to a servant to run

and get a basket of peaches from the best tree. Mr. Webb was

saving these fine peaches for preserves.     (So he called out:

'Now, Lucy, the other peaches are good enough, I am saving that

tree.' When Grandmother says:  'I am glad, Mr. Webb, that I

am not like you.'  When Grandfather replied:  'Well, Lucy, it









             <B>BIRCHARD LIBRARY FOUNDED--1873          245</B>



is well I am not, or you would never have anything to give if I

were.'  My  mother has often said if I would only have her

[Grandmother's] good kind heart, it would be all she would ask

for me."

  The boys are all at home and we have delightful times together.

Birch with his methodical habit has gone to work putting the

library in order and Rud works under him with great industry;

and Webb, he is engaged in the scrapbook, putting in his father's

accumulated scraps, while Papa and I sit in the easy chairs and

watch the bairns--with occasional invasions by Scott and Fanny

which enliven and make us all happy in their sweet presence.)<B>*</B>



                              FREMONT, OHIO, July 12, 1873.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I am hungry to see you.  It seemed a

week or two ago that I should be able to come down and bring

you up for a good stay about three days. But Uncle's health,

with my wife's prospective confinement by the time Uncle is up

again, will postpone it until fall.

  Your paper on the Mound-builders is better even than I an-

ticipated. It will be the authority on the subject. Before I saw it,

I wrote to Robert Clarke that I hoped he would put it in con-

venient form. It would be a good thing to have for distribution

in payment of debts I owe in many quarters, besides being the

fit thing.

  I saw an old gentleman of intelligence and truthfulness yester-

day -- Reuben Rice, of Ottawa County -- who told me that while

he was learning his trade as a printer in Columbus in 1815, the

old State House was building. He says the brick were made of

clay taken from the mound on Mound Street in the southern part

of the town.  The big mound was a natural (probably) elevation

overlooking the Scioto composed of gravel and sand, such as

is usually found on the banks of large streams, and the artificial

mound on its summit he supposes to have been made of unburnt

clay.

  I send you a newspaper showing the effort we are making to

secure the purchase of Fort Stephenson for a park. It would

<B>246          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



carry easily but for the feeling that the proprietor is putting it at

an exorbitant price. This with "economy" may defeat us for a

while. But we will worry at it until we win.

  Our library we mean to start next winter in a hall owned by

Uncle Birchard which will be temporarily fitted up for it.

  My boys are all at home now and a happy time we are having.

-- Your plans for the summer?

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.



  July 23. -- In an address on the locality now called Fremont,

formerly Lower Sandusky, at an earlier day known about equally

as Sandusky or the Lower Sandusky, at a still earlier period to the

French traders as Junqueinandeh (Junandat), and in traditions

as the Neutral Villages, I propose to give what I can gather re-

lating to it prior to a period of authentic history in the Indian

traditions which have been preserved; and some sketches of

events and scenes since the period of authentic history and prior

to its permanent settlement by the Americans. Since its settle-

ment by the Americans in 1811, its history, thanks to the heroism

of Colonel Croghan and the little band which made the brilliant

defense of Fort Stephenson in 1813,--its general history and its

local ditto, has been tolerably well cared for by Dr. Brainard,

Homer Everett, and Morris E. Tyler. Speaking of traditions and

historical events before 1812, I can promise almost nothing from

original sources. My humble task is merely that of the compiler.

  Uncle is fond of repeating the reply made by some one to the

question, "My friend, why do you talk so much to yourself?"

"Well," replied the questionee, "I will tell you. I talk to myself

because I like to talk to a sensible man, and because I like to hear

a sensible man talk."

  August 2.--Yesterday morning at 3 A. M. our eighth child

was born. The seventh boy. Weight nine pounds. Eyes called

black, fat and healthy. Lucy has had misgivings about this con-

finement. She [suffered much and we were most anxious, al-

most despairing for hours, but] she gradually came to her usual

health.









             <B>BIRCHARD LIBRARY FOUNDED--1873          247</B>



                           FREMONT, OHIO, August 11, 1873.

  MY DEAR RUTHERFORD: -- Your mother and the new boy are

both doing well. Young hopeful is the best of infants.  He sleeps

and eats, and eats and sleeps -- "only this and nothing more" --

from morning to night. Your mother sits up, and in her cap and

wraps makes a grand appearance.

  Uncle Birchard has not been quite so well for a few days. He

did not feel able to go to church yesterday. Birch and Webb

occupied the pew. . . .

  You remember I sometimes make observations on the long

tongue of one of my fine boys. Do you? Well, I fear I must

repeat. What is put on a postal card is quite public. Other

members of the family, at least, are likely to read it. Nobody

here knew I had real estate at Columbus until the postal card

came. Keep your wits about you, my boy. You must try to

know a great deal. It is not so necessary to tell it all.



              "Aye free offhand your story tell

                When wi' a bosom crony,

              But still keep something to yoursel'

                Ye hardly tell to ony."



        . . . Write immediately and often.

                         Affectionately, your father,

                                                           H.

  R. P. HAYES,

       Kingston, Ohio.





  Fremont, Ohio, September 13, 1873. -- I begin a new book this

cold Saturday. The work I have been engaged in for several

weeks seems now complete or near to completion. When Uncle

Birchard decided to adopt my suggestion to establish a free library

in Fremont, it seemed to me fit that it should occupy a part of

the site of old Fort Stephenson, and that, by appropriating part

of the library fund towards the purchase money, the town would

be willing to furnish enough to buy the whole for a park. The

owner, Mr. Leppelman, asked eighteen thousand dollars for the









<B>248          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



property.  This was a great price.  The people generally approved

of the purchase, but in a quiet way there was strong opposition.

Some oposed it because they didn't want Leppelman to make a 

speculation.  The exorbitant price was the ostensible reason for

opposition.  Some opposed it on the general ground of dislike to

all advance.  It is said the Catholics opposed because they hate

libraries.  One secretly opposed because it would be an honor to

Uncle.  Finally the council refused to pay eighteen thousand

dollars and offered fifteen thousand dollars.  Leppelman refused

the offer.



     The proposition was likely to fail.  The majority of council

wanted it to fail.  I consulted all of the trustees; told them I did

not mean to fail, and proposed to offer Leppelman three thousand

dollars if he would accept the fifteen thousand dollars offered by

the city council.  It was agreed that I might do so on my in-

dividual responsibility, with the understanding that the trusteees

would hold me harmless out of the library fund.  I made the

offer to Leppelman.  He agreed to it.  The council were taken by

surprise by his acceptance, and after some trouble the bonds of the

town were authorized, and I now think the fort is safe in the 

hands of the public.  Mayor Dickinson told me that it had to be

done promptly, or it would have failed.  It is conjectured that

the enemy to be feared is the Catholic influence.

     James K. Glenn [of New York] and I hold the legal title to

about three thousand two hundred and fifty acres of land in

Wayne County, West Virginia, and to coal and other mineral

rights in eleven hundred acres more.  One-fifth of it belongs to

me, two-fifths to Glenn, and two-fifths to the heirs of Gregory,

E. M. or Henry Sheldon, [and] others unknown.

     I am now chiefly interested in providing a good estate for my-

self and family.  I have secured real estate in Toledo and one

piece in Columbus worth now about two hundred and fifty

thousand dollars and likely to increase rapidly in value.  If I

can hold it ten years it will, I believe, be worth one half a million

of dollars.  My debts do not equal by a large sum my other

property.  But my indebtedness is large, and how to carry it is

an important question.  But first what is it?

  This looks much more formidable than it is. The last and

third items about twenty-three thousand dollars, I could today

sell out at a profit of ten thousand dollars. But it needs attention

so as not to be caught.

  September 19.--Returned last evening from an enjoyable re-

union of the Twenty-third at Wellington.  I was well entertained

by my friend S. S. Warner. . . . I was elected President

of the Twenty-third Association.

  October 4, 1873. -- I am fifty-one years old today. Gray hairs

are getting into my brow; hair grows preceptibly thinner, but

no baldness yet. I read without glasses but my eyes inflame if

I read or write many hours by lamplight; more fleshy and full-

stomached, with shorter breath; a few twinges of rheumatism;

a fondness for a nap after dinner; teeth pretty good, but several

plugged and a few gone; whiskers rapidly whitening. These are

the symptoms of old age.  On the other hand, a youthful and

elastic spirit: fondness for all young people and their employ-

ments and amusements.  A  fresh, ruddy complexion and con-

siderable physical strength and activity almost persuade me that

I am still in my youth.

  October 10.--I today formed the purpose to study the Spanish

language enough to read Don Quixote. Yesterday I bought of

Mr. Curtis one hundred and sixty volumes for Birchard Library.

He threw in a few Spanish books of small value. It occurs to

me I can easily learn to translate. For a catalogue of Birchard

Library books, I purpose to mark with letter "B" the books we

have in the Cincinnati Mercantile Library catalogue.









<B>250          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  October 21.--The reunion of the Army of the Tennessee at

Toledo on the 15th and 16th passed off well. General Grant

named me as one of the gentlemen he wished to occupy the stand

with him to review the two military companies and receive the

ladies. He is more fleshy, his face red; no other indication of

the use of liquor; and generous living and good health are prob-

ably chargeable with his rosy complexion. He is quiet and self-

possessed as usual. Generals Sheridan and Custer both invited

me to a tour on the plains with them next season at any time.

General Sherman returned here with Buckland. We dined with

him at General Buckland's Friday. Today I went over to Toledo

and General Howard returned with me--the snow falling rap-

idly, wet and heavy, as we entered the grove in the dark.

  October 22. -- Snow three or four inches deep. It clings to the

leaves which are still abundant on the trees, and many trees, fruit

and forest, are broken down. General Howard returned this

evening. He strikes one as a sincere man. Rather too much

profession, perhaps. He feels annoyed by the attacks on his

integrity. But likes to talk of it.

  January 29, 1874.--The twenty-first of January, 1874, was a

dismal day. The fog in Fremont was the heaviest ever known.

Uncle had passed a comfortable night and was able to get up as

usual and go around the house. He shaved himself and was quite

comfortable until about eleven o'clock A. M. He had lain down

after looking at the work going on finishing the new house be-

longing to Miss Grant [where he had been living for some time].

Mrs. Grant sang to him "When I can read my title clear."

  About eleven, Mrs. Grant, seeing he was in great pain from

pressure and coldness in his breast and arms, called Sarah Jane,

who was upstairs. As she came down I entered the house. It was

evident that the attack was serious and dangerous. Uncle prayed

that his sufferings might be short and that he might soon be at

rest. . . .  Miss Grant got the remedies which usually re-

lieved him. They gradually relieved the pain but his head and

face remained as cold as death. He had no more pain. His voice

continued natural and strong and his head clear until he died

about an hour after the attack began.









             <B>DEATH OF SARDIS BIRCHARD--1874          251</B>



  He was cheerful, kind, and friendly and affectionate. He said

he was glad I could be with him. I held his right hand. He

said, "John Rogers probably suffered more than I have, but he

didn't make so much fuss as I do." "You, as a soldier wounded,

were worse off than I, but you were a hero and could bear it."

"I shall soon see Fanny and Mrs. Valette; that is, if I go to the

right place (this with a playful smile) and I think I shall." And

so with pleasant talk until the moment when a single spasm

brought the end. A beautiful close to a beautiful life.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, January 29, 1874.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- Cup number one is safely with its com-

panion. Mrs. Hayes regards as a favorable omen for the young-

ster, Manning Force Hayes, that he gets a double gift. He is

growing well, and is a great favorite. No better baby, no merrier;

and few prettier are to be found. My uncle regarded him with

unusual interest. Only four days before his death he came up

in a sleigh to see him, and often said he was very proud of him.

He is the first and only child born in Spiegel Grove. We thank

you for the good omen.

  Uncle's death was a happy one. He suffered very little--

none at all the last half-hour of his life. He talked in a cheerful,

pleasant way and with a distinct and natural voice up to the

moment of death. He had been weak, but comfortable, for a

long time.  I did not dare to be away from him.  His attack

lasted about an hour, if it could be called an attack, and all of

those he wished to see were with him throughout except the

doctor. I was near being absent, but happily was with him

throughout. He was gifted with many unusual and beautiful

traits, and had almost nothing but good in his character. We yet

feel lonely and sad without him. At the same time it is a happi-

ness to think of his release in so pleasant a way. He could joke

and be serious by turns to the close. He felt confident of meet-

ing his friends again beyond.

  Do come and see us if you can and when you can.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.









<B>252          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                         FREMONT, OHIO, February 8, 1874.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I am very glad, we are very glad, you

are coming. Can't you squeeze out a day or two more than your

plan?  Do, if you can.  We may not count on good weather at

this season.  If fair, we can go mound digging; if foul, we can

talk and have house times together.

  We are getting ready to make a start in a temporary way with

our free library.  Everything is yet to do. Try to post yourself

as to getting books.  The Tauchnitz collection, Leipsic--are the

books in the paper covers fit to use?  How to get them?  I have

written Mr. Poole at Chicago the same questions, but am not

confident that I have his address.

  In the "Transactions and Collections of the American An-

tiquarian Society," volume 2, 273, Colonel John Johnston says:

"The Shawanoese have been established in Ohio about sixty-five

years. They came from west Florida." This in 1819. He

quotes from Black Hoof and traces them back to the Suwanee

River.  This seems to be "original source."  But you have no

doubt seen it. See also McKenny and Hall, volume 3, 110.

  Mrs. Waite was considerably broken down by the Cincinnati

doings. She does not now leave her room. She does not enjoy

the prospect. It comes too late for her. -- All well with us.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

      Cincinnati, Ohio.



                         FREMONT, OHIO, February 24, 1874.

  DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your favor of the 20th inst.

with the Commission, and Act of the General Assembly relating

to the Centennial [Exposition at Philadelphia] which you inclose.

Please present my compliments to Governor Allen and say to him

that it affords me great pleasure to accept the appointment which

he has done me the honor to confer. I will be prepared to at-









             <B>SETTLING BIRCHARD ESTATE--1874          253</B>



tend a meeting of the board at Columbus whenever it is deemed

advisable to call one.

                      Very respectfully,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

   SECRETARY OF GOVERNOR ALLEN,

       Columbus.





   Fremont, March 1, 1874.--A lovely springlike day.  We have

been very busy since Uncle's death. Correspondence, his estate,

the preparations for the changed condition of things have oc-

cupied our time. We are now engaged in getting ready to open

temporarily the Birchard Library in a room we are making in

Birchard Hall. The principal work is for me to do. The other

members of the board are prompt and willing to do what is

needed, but they naturally expect me to take the lead. I am

also clearing two or three acres in the rear of the house for a

garden, chiefly for fruit.  I am also building--or rather adding

to our home in Spiegel Grove.

  March 8, 1874.--A cold, blustering winter morning pushes

aside the lovely spring that was opening. This morning Lucy at

breakfast was reminding us of the transparencies in which I had

figured, when a candidate, ten years ago, for Congress. In one

they represented my competitor, Theodore Cook, in the act of

broiling (cooking) me on a gridiron.  In another, when  I was

absent fighting Rebels, the picture represented me dodging Rebel

bullets in the Shenandoah Valley.  This was suppressed by our

opponents themselves before it had gone the rounds. Looking

in an old file of the Commercial for these things, I find in the

paper of September 17, that to the suggestion that I get a fur-

lough to come home and stump my district, I replied: "An

officer fit for duty who would desert his post now  for such a

purpose would deserve defeat and disgrace." The whole letter,

I think, was in the Gazette about that time. The paper of Sep-

tember 26 contains a description of a Lincoln procession in

which are several transparencies on which my name, or phiz

occurs, notably one where Hayes is stumping the Shenandoah

Valley.









<B>254          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  In the Commercial of October 6, 1864, is a letter of Captain

Otis on my conduct as a soldier and on the transparency carried

by the adversary in Cincinnati on the 17th [of] September.

  In the paper of September 24 is a paragraph on the trans-

parency, but not a full description of it.

  Editorial of October 11. Soldiers' resolve of October.

  [The] daily Commercial, May 3, 1865, gives the resolutions

of the Ohio soldiers in the Shenandoah Valley nominating Gen-

eral Hayes for Governor of Ohio. They say he "is a soldier

unsurpassed for patriotism and bravery."

  May 12, 1865, General Hayes "respectfully declines to permit

his name to be used for the nomination for Governor, etc., etc."





                            FREMONT, OHIO, March 8, 1874.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--We were busy yesterday pulling up trees,

ditching, and cataloguing, so that no letter with that one hundred

dollars you are thirsting after will start before Monday night.

  We are now in the rough of our book lists down to the last

class, viz., the Juveniles. We are beyond our depth. We, of

course, know that Mayne Reid and William T. Adams are to go

down solid; but then the other mess of stuff! Can you and

Birch help?

  Four-fifths of the trees are down in the garden plot, but all

are to be yet chopped up. Rud really works well. The glory

of hauling out by the roots big trees, with ropes, blocks, capstan,

and Ned excites the boy. . . .  Scott without hat or over-

shoes, sings through the grove "John Brown's Body," and is

happy. When Fanny gets tired of us, she strays down [to]

Sarah's [Miss Grant's], and rioting in our premises ceases dur-

ing her absence.

  The temperance crusade has not reached Fremont yet. It has

broken out in Norwalk and Findlay. It does good in many

places.

                        Affectionately,

                                                        H.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

      Ithaca.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, April 19, 1874.

  MY DEAR WEBB: -- Glad to hear from you.  The  fruit tree

business needs you here and I miss you. . . . We begin

tomorrow on the evergreen and deciduous ornamental trees.



  The temperance revival is the town talk now. Thus far it

has been well conducted and done much good. I hope it will

continue under safe direction to the end.

  We have ordered the bulk of our books from Robert Clarke

and Company. . . . Their bids were a reduction from retail

prices of about 33 1/3 to 40 per cent.

  Write often.

                                                       [H.]

  WEBB C. HAYES.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, April 21, 1874.

  DEAR UNCLE: --. . . I regard the inflation acts as wrong

in all ways. Personally I am one of the noble army of debtors,

and can stand it if others can. But it is a wretched business.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE A. BIRCHARD,

      Vermont.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, April 27, 1874.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- Nothing but the inevitable would force

me to forego the trip with you to Pomeroy. But you know the

bonds we are under. . . . We  are getting on well with

our little improvements.  I have put out about three hundred

trees and shrubs--mostly fruit,--pulled up by the roots about

five hundred forest trees, built a kitchen and other things.

  The books are now coming, and I am largely in debt and

"so busy" is no word for it.

  The veto [of the so-called inflation bill] is good. We shall be

able to stick to Grant to the end. . . .

  I am reading between times "Noctes Ambrosianae." Years

ago I worried over it. But now it is delightful.

  I believe you thought you couldn't come here with your wife

(how is that in your ears?) in May. We shall be glad to have









<B>256          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



you then, if you can come, and later we hope we can reckon

on a visit for sure.

  Mrs. Hayes sends her love and warmest congratulations, in all

which I join, to you and yours.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

       Cincinnati.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 27, 1874.

  MY DEAR SIR:-- Mrs. Hayes and myself are very reluctant to

give up the happiness we should receive by accepting your kind

invitation of the 18th [to the marriage of your daughter to Gen-

eral M. F. Force].  But it is quite out of the question for us to

leave our little folks in the present condition of our family.

  We feel that we may in the heartiest way congratulate you and

Mrs. Horton on the happy occasion. Our friendship and ad-

miration for General Force is very great and we rejoice that he

is so fortunate in this, the great event of his life.

  Since your connection with the railroad we have hoped that

you would be drawn to this part of the State. We count on a

visit from Mrs. Horton and yourself whenever you visit Toledo.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.<B>*</B>

  HONORABLE V. B. HORTON.

      Pomeroy, Ohio.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, May 14, 1874.

  MY DEAR UNCLE:-- . . . Mother's old letter will interest

me.  You know I am given to antiquarian and genealogical pur-

suits.  An old family letter is a delight to my eyes.  I can prowl

in the old trunks of letters by the day with undiminished zest.

  Climate does not change.  The Moravians  spent here the

spring of 1782.  Their full diaries show the same sort of weather,

identically almost, that we had last year.--All well.

                          Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE A. BIRCHARD.

             <B>PIONEER SOCIETY FORMED--1874          257</B>



  June 10, 1874. -- We have been busy wtih our improvements

of grounds and house for more than three months. We are now

at the end of the first installment --kitchen, range, buttery, etc.

    . . . I am now taking a good deal of comfort making pretty

bits of landscape by opening the grove to get outlooks. . . .

  August 13.--Not many items find themselves a place in this

little book. For two months I have been engaged in pushing

my improvements, getting Birchard Library into full operation,

and organizing a Pioneer and Historical Society for Sandusky

County.

  Birch graduated at Cornell in July, visited the remaining

kindred in Vermont, and is now at home, ready to begin law.

His diffidence has kept him from improving his opportunity to

learn to speak.  He is an accurate, thorough student, not fond

of books as I was, with an unusual fondness for statistics, espe-

cially for the preparation of tabular information.  Webb is not

scholarly. He will not graduate. A special course is the most

he will attempt.  Both boys are honest, faithful, and affectionate.

I am confident both will become respectable and reliable gentle-

men.  Ruddy is our invalid.  Tall and slender, at sixteen he is

unfit for hard work or hard study. A bright handsome, jovial

boy. . . .  We  now are talking of trying a manual-labor

agricultural college.

  Fanny has made small progress as a scholar, has not tried to

do it.  She is healthy, very bright and happy, well-looking and

a treasure. Scott, almost four (February 8) is our handsomest.

Interesting, too honest to joke, or to comprehend a joke readily.

He  talks with some  hesitation  when excited, and has  many

pretty ways.    He  says  many    queer things.    He  and  Fanny

naturally run together.  Both are fond of animals. Fanny is a

boy in climbing, swinging, and playing generally. Little Manning

is a fine, dark-eyed little fellow.  Lively and promising.  A year

old on the first. No stick is he.

  I am to speak at the pioneer picnic about the I0th [of]  Sep-

tember. Things as they were in 1830 is a good topic. That is

the date fixed as our pioneer period.       Those settling in the

county prior to 1830 are Pioneers. A few statistics about this

    17









<B>258          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and other localities at that date, other facts, modes of travel,

culture, religion, prices, etc., etc.; above all, the persons, the

characters of that day.

  I am also to speak at the County Fair. A mere student or ap-

prentice in farming, I must talk to farmers. The benefit of

ornamental work, as shade trees, fences, and the like. The im-

portance of adding to the selling value of farms. Thorough

tillage required by the increasing value of land. Drainage, fruit,

etc., etc.

  August 28.  Friday, A. M.-- Our dear little Manning died this

morning soon after midnight, about 12:30. He suffered very

little, being wholly unconscious the last hour or two. He has not

seemed altogether healthy at any time. . . . He was a lovely,

beautiful child. His eyes were very dark, large, mild, and sweet.

His forehead broad, high, and prominent. Probably our hand-

somest child except Georgey. Dear boy! he is lost to us. We

may hope he is saved from a world of suffering and sorrow.

  August 29. -- We buried the dear one this afternoon.  Mr. G.

Lease, at the house, gave out the hymn, read the Ninetieth Psalm,

and the Methodist Episcopal service at the grave.



             ST. CHARLES HOTEL, NORWALK, October 6, 1874.

  MY DARLING: -- People who don't have a quarter the affection

we have for each other, write letters when separate daily. Why

not I one at least this trip?

  I make headquarters here. A good, quiet, homelike inn. Last

night at Milan I had a fine little hall full of people --women and

youngsters with the yeomanry. Was in good trim and without

a particle of real preparation, had a good time of it. Two meet-

ings today. One, with Foster, at Ripley, one tonight at Fair-

field. Tomorrow night at Greenwich. Home to you Thursday

morning.

  Don't work hard. Sit down and enjoy yourself.-- Love to

'em all.

                   Affectionately, your

  MRS. HAYES.                                               R.









             <B>CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN--1874          259</B>



                                 FREMONT, October 11, 1874.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--The last week has been political largely.

I spoke to good meetings at four points--Milan in Erie County,

and at three places in Huron County. The main interest is

centered on the congressional contest. Last year the Democrats

had about eight hundred majority on the state ticket, and the

year before on the same ticket the Republicans had less than two

hundred majority. But Foster is very popular, and his friends

are working well. I am hopeful but not confident. The Demo-

crats held a meeting here, which was well attended, but not at all

enthusiastic. Governor Allen made a queer, old-fashioned, ill-

timed speech that bored his friends. They were glad to get him

stopped to give place to Pendleton, who made one of his best

speeches. It was in excellent taste and temper, and as sound and

sensible as an argument in favor of an inflation of the currency

could be made. They honored us with a call, and filled the

house with the laughter of their joking.

        . . . We are all very well.  Nobody in the family has any

symptoms of chills and fever. The first fall I have escaped al-

together since my campaigns in eastern Virginia. This speaks

well for Spiegel Grove. . . .

  I forgot to say that Senator Sherman made a fine speech to

a good audience in Mammoth Hall, Thursday night. He speaks

very rapidly in a straightforward way, without ornament or

attempt at display. Birch said of it: "If I ever learn to speak,

it will be that way."

  Be a good boy. No drinking or other foolish and ruinous

practices.  Tell us all about your doings.  We love you very

much.

                         Affectionately,

                                                          H.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

      Ithaca.



  October 20-23.--Made  a delightful trip.  To Cleveland to

attend at Judge [Rufus P.] Ranney's office a meeting of the

Board of State Managers of the Centennial. Colonel [Barnabas]

Burns, the judge, Mr. F. W. Green, secretary, and myself pres-









<B>260          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ent.  Governor Noyes and Colonel [George W.] McCook absent.

After this, with Mr. Morton, of Cambridge, Mr. Reddington

and his partner and son-in-law, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Green over

the Tuscarawas Valley Railroad to Canal Dover.  On the 21st,

I there met the Cincinnati party, Judge Matthews, McLaren,

Rogers, Larz Anderson, Baer, Fallis, Cochran, of the Com-

mercial, and from Marietta, General Warner, President of the

M. P. & C. R. R., Douglass Putnam, Mr. Gates, the editor

of the Register, and Mr. McArthur; an Englishman, Mr. Davis,

and others. We visited the coal mines, the iron furnace (Glas-

gow) of the Scotch capitalists, etc., etc.  The blackband iron ore

now promises great things.  It seems to equal the Scotch pig and

to be far more abundant and accessible.  Stayed at General

Warner's in Marietta night of [the] 22d and called at Mr. Wil-

helmi's in Canal Dover.

  November 20. -- Our first snow this season covers the ground

this morning to the depth of full six inches.  It hangs on the

trees beautifully. Scott and Fanny are roaring and shouting with

delight.  We  have had the longest and finest Indian summer

remembered by the oldest inhabitant.  Probably  two months,

with hardly a day's interruption; certainly, full six weeks of the

genuine Indian summer. Very dry the most of the time. Fires

in the woods in Wood County and elsewhere.  No running water

at all in Portage River or any other stream between Sandusky

and Maumee rivers.

  Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1874.-- . . .  In

church thought of an invitation to deliver the Phi Beta Kappa

oration at Marietta next June.  I had intended to decline.  But

it ran through my head that I could turn the address into a

historical and pioneer direction.  Say, "The Scholarship and

Scholars of Pioneer Days in Ohio," or something of that sort.

Perhaps I ought to accept.

  About twenty persons sat down at our Thanksgiving dinner

today. . . .   Our  Winnie,  colored  cook,  outdid  herself.

Three turkeys, large and well roasted, one not carved, one ham

and a dish of fried oysters, bread, rolls, finely cut cheese, mashed

potatoes, stewed tomatoes, cranberries.









             <B>ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH--1874          261</B>



  November 30. -- I today accepted the invitation of the Phi

Beta Kappa Society of Marietta College on the 29th of June next.

Can I do it creditably?  I will try it. Novel work for me.  Can

I make the pioneer scholars a theme? Speak of editors, lawyers,

poets, clergymen; describe Phil Doddridge, Tiema, Flint, Dr.

Drake, Ewing, etc., etc.

  December I.--I thought of gradually getting together what

is known and interesting about the Sandusky region, the Wyan-

dots, etc., under the caption, "Notes on the Sandusky Valley,"

particularly on Sandusky County and Fremont.  Prepare maps

of the country as we find them from the earliest times until now.

Say, six or eight of them, including Lake Erie, the "Neuter

Nation," etc., etc.

  December 2. -- Last evening at sundown we had a singular

thing. The sky was reddish and bright, the reflection of the sun

on the clouds, as is frequently the case; but the unusual appear-

ance was a streak of green near the horizon stretching perhaps

thirty degrees on each side of the spot where the sun disappeared.

Below the green was a streak of red and above it another.

The green stream was of irregular width, but possibly a degree

or two wide generally.  I have no recollection of seeing this

green color before in the clouds or sky.  It was a lively green,

lighter in some parts than in others, a much more decided green

than I have ever seen in water.

  December 3. -- Our five days' sleighing left us yesterday under

a summer's sun.  Three days of it were very good.  It brought

out the pork and corn which now bear good prices, pork eight

dollars per one hundred pounds, and corn fifty cents per bushel

for new corn. More goods sold than usual. Shomo over seven

hundred dollars one day for shoes, Dorr over five hundred dol-

lars ditto. Times must improve.

  December 6. -- In Marietta talk, can't I work up an introduc-

tion of this sort? The age of our fathers and the first generation

of their descendants, or the first four-score years since its settle-

ment, is its golden age.  Scholarship and culture, the era of

New England scholars settled in the valley of the beautiful









<B>262          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



river. But now succeeds the iron age, the age of petroleum,

of coal, of iron, of mines, of railways, of great fortunes sud-

denly acquired; smoke and dust covering, concealing, or de-

stroying the lovely landscapes. Coarse, hard, material things.

(See Ruskin.)

  December 7. -- The more I think of it, the more I am convinced

that my occupations for years past have been inconsistent with

that culture which is required to deal in scholarly fashion with

a topic appropriate to the meeting of the Phi Beta Kappa at

Marietta. I must therefore attempt something less ambitious.

For example, "Notes on the Scholarship of Early Times in Ohio,"

or "on the Scholars of Early Times."



                         FREMONT, OHIO, January 2, 1875.

  MY DEAR GUY:-- Your letter of the 19th came duly. After

some search and inquiry I do not find a copy of the new con-

stitution which was defeated in August last. I have a number

of copies carefully laid away, and will surely get one soon. I

hope also to obtain a copy of the debates for you. I go to

Columbus on Wednesday to attend a meeting of our State

Board on the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876,

and shall probably get them then. Our defeated constitution

was no doubt a pretty good one, but we had a pretty good one

already. This fact with the unpopularity of the late convention,

caused mainly by its greatly protracted session and tedious dis-

cussions, worked the overwhelming defeat of the new paper. I

thought it a slight improvement on the old one, and did not

vote on its adoption at all. If I had felt interest enough in the

question to go to the polls I should probably have voted for it.

  It seems to me that the most important thing in Texas, as

everywhere else, is education for all.  I, of course, don't be-

lieve in forcing whites and blacks together. But both classes

should be fully provided for. I recognize fully the evil of rule

by ignorance. I see enough of it under my own eyes. You

are not so much worse off in this respect than New York,

Chicago, and other cities having a large uneducated population.

But the remedy is not, I am sure, to be found in the abandon-









             <B>CENTENNIAL COMMISSION--1875          263</B>



ment of the American principle that all must share in govern-

ment. The whites of the South must do as we do, forget to

drive and learn to lead the ignorant masses around them. But

I will not argue. You and I are now nearer together than we

have been since our boyhood. We shall probably soon vote the

same ticket. But not if you continue to indulge a hope that

slavery is in some form to be restored. That is surely not to be.

  We are all in health and are together enjoying the holidays.

My visit to Texas must be postponed a few years until the two

little ones are larger. Did I send you their picture? If not I

will.

  In planning for next summer, don't forget that here is a home

to which you will be warmly welcomed.

                           As ever,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

      Texas.





  January 3, 1875. -- I have declined the appointment to the Phi

Beta Kappa oration at Marietta. This leaves me free to pursue

my pet studies and occupation. I will gather daily material for

my notes on the Wyandots, notes on the Sandusky Valley, and on

the defense of Fort Stephenson in 1813. The latter first. In

this way: Get the best-told account of it and then every ac-

count and incident from eye-witnesses and contemporaries.

  January  11.--A  delightful  visit  with  Birch  to  Laura

[Mitchell] in Columbus.  Her children are treasures indeed.  All

interesting, promising, handsome, and sweet-mannered. . . .

  Birch and I met with the Centennials. I talked a few minutes

to the Agriculturals; prospects good.

  The snow that fell the night of the first still lies on the ground

with some additions, making the best sleighing possible in this

climate. We now have eight or ten inches of snow well packed

on hard and smooth roads. Ten days of good sleighing in one

spell.









<B>264          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                          FREMONT, OHIO, February 8, 1875.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Ever since I read the account of the

bar meeting on the death of Judge Walker, I have intended to

write to you about our Historical Society getting up a memorial

sketch of his life. A short sketch -- a portrait -- the proceedings

and addresses of the bar, etc., etc., would make a pamphlet of

suitable size.  It seems to me that a man with so many titles to

grateful remembrance should be noticed, and his character and

services preserved in this way.  The Massachusetts and other

Eastern societies do such things. Why can't we? The labor

will be small, and the expense can be provided for, I think, with-

out difficulty. You may call on me for ten dollars towards it,

or more if necessary.

  Don't work too hard. -- Our kindest regards to Mrs. Force.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Young Longworth would perhaps get it up. His

beautiful talk was capital in all respects, and shows that he is

fitted for the work.--H.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

      Cincinnati, Ohio.



  February 9.--Ten  degrees minus this morning.           A  cold,

pleasant winter; over six weeks of cold weather, with only two

or three thaws of a few hours. The snow which fell New Year's

day is almost all of it still on the ground.  Not good sleighing

on the highways which are much travelled.

  February 12. -- Yesterday William Whiteley, of Springfield,

the manufacturer of mowers and reapers, etc., came.

He is a nephew of Colonel  Wm. Whiteley who was killed at the

Thames and who, it is probable, killed Tecumseh.  An English-

looking man.  His grandfather came from England in 1763--

or was it his great-grandfather?  He and the whole family have

retained the English look.  Tall, strong, ruddy, and robust.  A

simple-minded man, patriotic. religious, and enthusiastic in the

relic department of the Centennial.









             <B>SEVERITY OF WINTER--1875          265</B>



                         FREMONT, OHIO, February 12, 1875.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--Your studies are all well enough.  The

main thing is the zeal and perseverance of the lad. I suspect

you are discovering your gift. . . .

  We had a glorious snow-storm yesterday. The biggest flakes

I have seen in years.  We took all hands in the sleigh and

pushed out in the midst of it. Very windy but mercury up to

28 degrees, so they stood it with shouts and laughter.  The snow

is now a foot deep. Part of the family going it now. Little

Charlie will earn his oats while the sleighing lasts. This is the

thirty-ninth day of sleighing this year. Quite an unusual thing

in our latitude. The weather bright but cold. The thermometer

on the north porch shows 12 degrees, while in the sun on the

south porch it shows 46 degrees. A wide difference. "Moral":

--Keep on the sunny side in cold weather. Even the coldest

of us has a sunny side if one could only discover it. -- All well.

                         Affectionately,

                                                           H.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

       Ithaca.



  February 17. -- At Toledo yesterday.  Prepared to put in a

claim for damages by reason of raising the grade of St. Clair

Street.  The block owned by Uncle with Wilson and Miller at

the corner of St. Clair and Washington must be raised four or

five feet. It is ninety by seventy [feet], a three-story brick.

The mere raising will be about three thousand dollars. The

total cost of the change will be about five thousand dollars.

There is a probability of losing some rent.  We  shall multiply

by two and put in the nominal claim of twelve thousand dollars.

The city promises well.

   February 18. -- On going to town I found this was the coldest

day of the winter. At daylight in various places in town the

thermometers showed 16 to 22 degrees below zero. None warmer

than 16 degrees at daylight.

   February 22. -- Rud and I go to Lansing to deposit him in the

freshman class of the Michigan Agricultural College.  His weak









<B>266          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



eyes and delicate health has [have] prevented him from prepar-

ing to enter one of the great literary colleges, as Yale or Harvard.

He is scholarly enough; but health and eyes interfere. . . .

I preferred that he should go to the Ohio institution. But he

prefers Lansing. His relations and friends at Columbus would

be distracting and work is not compulsory. . . . He is in

many respects like the Birchards. He reminds me often of

Uncle Birchard. I hope the resemblance will continue.



                               DETROIT, February 26, 1875.

  MY DEAR RUDDY:--Before breakfast, at the Russell House,

a snow-storm out of doors. I send you twenty dollars and a

few words. You may charge in your carefully kept accounts

from three dollars to five dollars each month to pocket money--

not to exceed the last amount -- but do it in items as you spend.

All other items for needed articles. You should get a good

substantial carpet (perhaps rag is best), probably a few good

new strong chairs--no rocking-chair. If you get an armchair,

or the like, get two, so your chum can have one. Deal gener-

ously with him as you do with yourself. My only objection to

the arrangements there is the two-in-a-bed system. It is bad.

But if you stay and while you stay, you will not complain of it.

But let your words and conduct be perfectly pure--such as

your mother might know without bringing a blush to your cheek.

  I have thought that you might get a lounge bed, or two of

them, and get them into your room without crowding you out.

But perhaps not. When you are settled and quite sure to stay,

a small table and plain bookcase may be needed for the books

I will send, but not yet.

  Write often, at least once a week, if short. Oftener if any-

thing happens.  If not already mentioned, do not tell your

mother of the doubling in bed.

  I go home this morning to arrive in 6 P. M. train.

                       Affectionately,

                                                        H.

             <B>BENEFIT OF CHURCHGOING--1875          267</B>



  February 27.  Saturday.--. . .  Monday,  [the] 22nd,

Ruddy and I left home about 9:30 A. M. . . ., and reached

Lansing, Michigan, near dark. I placed him at the Agricultural

College, room 35, with C. I. Goodwin as chum. The president,

Abbott, seems to be a kind-hearted, capable gentleman. . . .

  I also visited the State  Prison at Lansing.      The  agent

(warden) was very kind to me. In the cells were a carpet (in

many instances), books [to] read at night, pictures, etc., etc.

Flowers, pet animals, and the like gave it a humane look. Surely

it is a good prison. I saw the man my friend June wants par-

doned, Thomas Flinton. He is a bright, good-looking fellow.

Judge Jared Patchin and Bradley Thompson of Detroit took a

good deal of interest in his case. Also Esquire William Daly

of Dearborn. Of his innocence all are confident. The governor

strikes me as a man seeking popularity, who lacks the independ-

ence and manhood to do right at the risk of losing his popularity.

Afraid of what will be said. He is prejudiced against the Irish

and Democrats.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 1, 1875.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--. . .  I hope you will be benefitted by

your churchgoing. Where the habit does not Christianize, it

generally civilizes.  That  is reason  enough  for supporting

churches, if there were no higher. . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                                        H.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

      Ithaca.



  March 12. -- Attended a gathering at Mr. Sheldon's; tea. Mr.

M. G. Hubbard, Dr. Rawson and wife, John Miller and wife,

Rev. Chittenden, Estella Rawson, Miss Ida Bush. Miss Ida is

a pianist, just returned from a two years in Germany to improve

in music. A young lady of good manners; plays no doubt well.

She played "Dixie" with her right hand and "Yankee Doodle"

with her left at same time!

  March 15. -- Yesterday was a beautiful spring day.  Mercury

up to 70 degrees. The thaw is complete, mud bottomless. The

heavy ice took off part of the upper dam at Moore's and injured

the lower. Cakes of ice twenty inches thick or more are scat-

tered over the bottom east of the tile works. Lucy and I rode

down to see the spectacle; mud too deep on the new grade of

Front Street; hitched and went on foot.

  March 18.  Thursday. --  We put Fanny and Scott each on a

sled with an umbrella on the pond where the ice is clear and

smooth.  The wind drove them along pleasantly.  Scott entered

into the spirit of it, and obeyed instructions perseveringly. Birch

and I enjoyed it quite as much as the children. This is the

first example of the utilization of the March winds I have known

of. I am entitled to a patent for it.

  March 20.--. . . Today is the sixty-second day of sleigh-

ing. The snow is much drifted but would be perhaps a foot deep

as an average.



                            FREMONT, OHIO, March 22, 1875.

  DEAR SIR:--A friend who is interested in the unfortunate

powder-mill is afraid of the passage of some act in the excite-

ment of the moment, which will destroy powder making in Ohio.

I am not at all informed as to the nature of the bills introduced.

but nothing hasty or ill-considered ought to be adopted.  Our

coal mining and stone quarries require a large amount of powder,

and I feel safe in assuming that the Legislature will look to all

interests before acting.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  (Show only to Thompson, of Lucas.)

  HONORABLE BENJAMIN INMAN,

      Columbus, Ohio.



  March 28. -- For some time I have made my Diary a mere

weather record. We are living happily; never more so.  Scott

Russell's promotion to pants has been the event of the last week.









             <B>DESIRED FOR GOVERNOR--MARCH, 1875          269</B>



Little Fanny is healthy, bright, and good.  She does not take to

"book larnin." But that will come in time, no doubt. Birch

takes more and more interest in the law.  I think he will be a

good lawyer.  Ruddy, at Lansing, says he is homesick.  He re-

peats it three times in the same letter. But his letters are cheer-

ful.  He says he works at chopping three hours daily.  Webb

writes good letters from Cornell. Lucy is healthy, and as she

grows older preserves her beauty.  She is large but not un-

wieldy. The only drawback is her frequent attacks of sick-

headaches.  Perhaps twice a month she suffers for a day or two.

I too am healthy, getting a little too fat for comfort. The in-

dependence of all political and other bother is a happiness.

  The Republican caucus at Columbus last Thursday, according

to report, was unanimously for me for governor. A third term

would be a distinction--a feather I would like to wear. No

man ever had it in Ohio. Letters tell me I am really wanted.

But the present condition of my money matters requires atten-

tion.  The chance of an election is not good.  More important

still, I do not sympathize with a large share of the party leaders.

I hate the corruptionists of whom  Butler is leader.  I doubt

the ultra measures relating to the South, and I am opposed to

the course of General Grant on the third term, the civil service,

and the appointment of unfit men on partisan or personal

grounds. I wouldn't hesitate to fight a losing battle if the cause

was wholly and clearly good and important.  I am not sure

that it is in all respects what it should be, and as to its importance,

I am more than in doubt.  Hence I have said decidedly no to all

who have approached me.

  April 14, 1875.--I am still importuned in all quarters to con-

sent to run as Republican candidate for governor. Several sug-

gest that if elected governor now, I will stand well for the

Presidency next year.  How wild!  What a queer lot we are

becoming! Nobody is out of the reach of that mania.



Private.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, April 14, 1875.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--I am in receipt of your favor of the 12th

as to the governorship.  What you say is very gratifying.  It is









<B>270          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



too flattering of course, but I like it. It warms me. I am carried

back to old times -- to Fremont days--to Carnifax.  I see it

all in your kind letter. So, be assured I feel as I ought to.<B>*</B>

  I wish I could. I like the place -- would take it again if it

was open to me. I don't care for the chances of defeat. I have

tried that two or three times, and it don't hurt me. I have written

a good many letters on this subject and have invariably said

"no" decisively, on account of my affairs. Private reasons alone.

If I were with you face to face, I could give you what would,

I know, be regarded by you as controlling, as it is by me. The

mere business -- pecuniary -- part I have named to many.  There

is another thing I do not write about. I am on the way, fairly,

to freedom. A year or two will, I am confident, do it. There-

fore, Major, I can't consent. This is final, and you may in the

briefest way, without flourish, let it be known, that on account

of private affairs, I am not in the list.

  Mrs. Hayes joins me in regards to Mrs. Bickham and yourself.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MAJOR W. D. BICKHAM,

       Dayton.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 14, 1875.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--. . .  I am kept for an hour or two

daily replying to letters importuning me to run for governor.

The Republican nomination is at my refusal. But I say "no"

with the assent of all of our household.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

      Ithaca.



  April 18. Sunday. -- The talk about my candidacy for gov-

ernor rather grows, in spite of my repeated refusals. I regret

this, flattering as it is to my self-esteem. I don't wish to say,

against a general and urgent request, no, with due emphasis.



<FONT SIZE="-1">  *The letter from Major Bickham urged Mr. Hayes to be a candidate

for governor, assuring him that it would make him the next President.</FONT>









             <B>DEMAND FOR CANDIDACY--APRIL, 1875          271</B>



It looks like a lack of appreciation of the good opinion of the

party, and a want of gratitude for past favors. The prospect

of an election seems to me to be not good. The third-term talk,

the Civil Rights Bill, the partisan appointments of the baser sort,

in other words the Butlerism of the Administration, are all bad,

and weights on us.

  April 30.--At Toledo ground frozen.  M. M. Green, H. S.

Walbridge, and S. M. Young sent for me to come over and help

along the Columbus and Toledo Railroad. They need one hun-

dred and forty thousand dollars more stock subscriptions. We

talked it up; had a meeting in the Exchange in the afternoon

to stir up a spirit which would make up Toledo's share, viz.,

sixty thousand dollars. The road would be an especial advantage

to the one-hundred-and-sixty-acre tract of Wilson and myself.

Without the railroad and its shops, etc., etc., adjacent to our

tract, its value would be put back five to ten years. I subscribed

five thousand dollars.

  May 1.--The reddish brown leaves begin to show on the soft

maples; the elms show the coming events a little; oaks are still

bare. The Forsythia showed one or two blossoms on the 28th.

We had our first asparagus yesterday.

  Cleveland, May 7.--With L. Austin at 8:30 A. M. to his

powder-mills, the scene of the fearful catastrophe in

[March]. Some thirty or forty tons of powder blew up, shat-

tering windows and injuring walls from five to ten miles distant.

It rung a farm bell forty miles off. Was plainly felt near Pitts-

burgh one hundred miles off, and yet some houses quite near to

the disaster were not injured, and people not over two miles

south did not hear or know it. The explanation is in the state

of the wind and the situation of the mills. The mills are in a

ravine, perhaps sixty to eighty feet below the general level of

the country. The force of the explosion followed down the

ravine to some extent as if fired in that direction. But probably

the wind had the most to do with the result. It was a day of

fearful wind, gusty and violent so as to make it dangerous to

roofs and houses.









<B>272          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  May 9. -- We saw the first green tree on the place yesterday,

the buckeye in [the] garden.  The leaves on the apple trees are

beginning to show.  No green forest trees in the grove yet.

  May  10.--Redbirds in the grove yesterday.  A  robin took

from the house a spool of thread to put into its nest on the

great oak nearest the front of the house.  He got tangled in it

and is now hanging by the neck between the hickory and oak

thirty feet up.

  The first cherries in bloom yesterday.  No tree in sight of

the house shows a solid green. The little apple trees and the

early harvest show the most green.

  May 11. -- I go to Toledo to meet with Centennial State Board

today.  I am asked to speak on Decoration Day in Toledo.  I am

inclined to accept.  May I speak of uniting with Confederates in

this ceremony?

  I would honor any man who dies in obedience to his convic-

tions of duty, who dies for others.  The conductor, the engineer,

the brakeman, who dies at his post; the captain, the sailor who

goes down at sea to save his passengers; the fireman who per-

ishes, the policeman who is killed in the line of duty.  But how

of those who died in an effort to destroy the good?  Does he be-

lieve in his work?  Martyrs of false religions?

  Every age has its temptations, its weaknesses, its dangers.

Ours is in the line of the snobbish and the sordid.

  May 12. -- Met yesterday at Toledo Judge Ranney, Colonel

Burns, George W. McCook, Governor Noyes, and Mr. [F. W.]

Green [Secretary] of State Centennial Board, also Judge Halley.

General Buckland, Mr. Griffith, [and] Walbridge of other com-

mittees.  The mayor called, Guido Marx, etc.  We talked over

plans, decided to erect a headquarters building at a cost [of] not

more than three thousand dollars, also to employ Mr. Whiteley

at three thousand dollars.



                            FREMONT, OHIO, May 27, 1875.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I congratulate you on your good for-

tune. It is, of course, a surprise. We talked of you Sunday









             <B>NOMINATED FOR GOVERNOR--JUNE, 1875          273</B>



over our first dish of mushrooms. We are having big ones this

year. Well, be a good boy. Come and tell us all about it when

you return.

  Dr. Webb and his wife are in Florence; go thence to the lakes

and summer in Switzerland.  I hope you will meet them.  I

don't think of any good people for letters. You will need none

with the doctor.

  Lucy is very well.  We all send love and hopes.  Write if you

feel like it and have time.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL W. A. KNAPP.



  May 29. -- Decoration Day.  Talked briefly to a great crowd

at Toledo.  Labored with Walbridge to complete the amount of

stock subscription required to secure the Columbus  and Toledo

Railroad. Both successful.

  May 31.--I am still importuned to allow my name to be used

for governor. I am no less averse today than at the beginning.

If Judge Taft and others should withdraw, and the convention

generally should insist on my candidacy, I shall not refuse.

This is not likely to happen. A general demand by the party

that has honored me so often, I regard as a command which I

must obey. if, notwithstanding my declination and known prefer-

ence, the members of the convention, with substantial unanimity,

insist on the use of my name, I shall regard their wish as a com-

mand and obey it. If the friends of Judge Taft or of other

candidates still present their names, I will under no circumstances

be a candidate against them.  In that event, my name must be

unqualifiedly withdrawn.

  June 3. -- I was nominated for governor yesterday at Colum-

bus. I persisted in declining to the last. The leading other can-

didate before the convention, Judge Taft. of Cincinnati, is an

able and good man. But he had such a record on the Bible ques-

tion in the schools that his nomination was impossible. I did

all I could to remove the prejudice against him and to aid in his

nomination. I sent to Richard Smith, a leader in the struggle for

    18









<B>274          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Judge Taft, the following dispatch: -- "I cannot allow my name

to be used in opposition to Judge Taft. He became a candidate

after I declined. He is an able and pure man and a sound Re-

publican. I would not accept a nomination obtained by a con-

test with him."  Another, as follows, to Charles Foster:--"I

have stated to everybody that I would not consent to go into a

contest. I do not want it, and would not consent to accept, if

nominated in opposition to Judge Taft."

  I was nominated notwithstanding, 396 for me, 151 for Taft.

The nomination, on motion of a friend of Taft, Major Bickham,

was made unanimous. At first, I wrote a dispatch declining.

Then came a dispatch from the secretary of the convention stat-

ing that, on behalf of his father, Charles P. Taft had moved my

nomination by acclamation, and that it was splendidly carried.

I then sent the following: -- "In deference to the wish of the

convention, I yield my preference and accept the nomination."

  The substance of all this is, that I did all I could to prevent

my own nomination and to aid Taft.  Taft being even then so

far short of a nomination, and in view of the decided wish of

the convention, and the injury my declination would do the party,

I gave up my own preference and declared purpose, and ac-

cepted. I am now in for it. I think the interesting point is to

rebuke the Democracy by a defeat for subserviency to Roman

Catholic demands.

  June 4. -- Wrote to General C. H. Grosvenor, requesting him

to prepare an address on the objectionable features of the last

Legislature.

  The Bible in the Public Schools: -- "A division of the school

fund is agitated and demanded" by the same power and upon the

same grounds, by which and on which the passage of the Geghan

Bill was demanded.

  My topics [will be] chiefly drawn from State affairs:--1.

Conduct of Democratic party in the investigation of grave charges

of corruption in the Legislature. 2. Its measures as to the

penal,  reformatory,  and  benevolent  institutions.    (Salaried

boards.)   (The benefit of unpaid service.)  3.  The Catholic

question.









             <B>NOMINATED FOR GOVERNOR--JUNE, 1875          275</B>



  June 5.--I am overwhelmed with correspondence by mail,

telegraph, etc., etc., congratulating me on my nomination, and

the manner of it. The newspapers show that it was done in a

way never before seen in Ohio, and rarely if ever anywhere.

It is reading that would turn a head not firm and level. I have

just written my competitor--if it is proper to call a man my

competitor with whom I in no way competed, and to whom I

gave a hearty support from the beginning.





Private.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, June 5, 1875.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I write to thank you in the sincerest and

heartiest way for your action on my nomination. It gave me

very great and much needed relief. On getting the secretary's

first dispatch I was sorely perplexed. To refuse would offend

and disappoint friends to whom I was under many obligations.

I wrote a dispatch declining, and was considering it with a

friend when the second dispatch from the secretary, announcing

the motion of Mr. Charles P. Taft, came and decided the ques-

tion. I am confident you would regard my course as fully justi-

fying your friendly act and speech, if all I have said and done

since this affair arose were fully before you.

                    Sincerely, your friend,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE A. TAFT,

      Cincinnati.

Private.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, June 8, 1875.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--Thanks for your paper of yesterday, and

still more for your efforts to get me out of this scrape before I

was in, and now to carry me through successfully.

  It is well and gratifying to have the convention facts fully

and authentically set forth. I read the article with much interest.

Hereafter we can afford to let bygones go, and seek discussion

only with the common adversary. I am perhaps under a delu-

sion, but I still hope to be supported by Halstead [editor of the









<B>276          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Cincinnati Commercial].  At any rate, being on the track, I now

want to win, and am willing to do my share of the solid work

required to do it. It is of the first importance to nominate in the

counties, and [to] organize early. For the topics of the canvass,

and bringing them before the people, the press is the means.

Meetings and speeches are less important relatively than ever

before.  They come in too late, and in a day of enterprising news-

paper men, they are merely stale repetitions of the press. Meet-

ings and speeches, like the election itself, are the results of what

the press has already done.

  I judge from several paragraphs that you regard the sub-

serviency of the Democratic party to Catholic designs as the

salient feature of the canvass.  It is certainly so in popular

estimation in this quarter.  If you have leisure to give me a

brief note on this head, it will be useful.

  What I have said about meetings and speeches is not with a

view to shirk labor. I am ready to do all that may be reasonably

expected.  But early and earnest discussion by the press is, I

am sure, far more effective.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MAJOR W. D. BICKHAM,

       Dayton.

                               FREMONT, OHIO, June 9, 1875.

  MY DEAR R--:--If you were here and could have the reading

and answering of the host of letters I am getting, you would

excuse neglects. . . .  This political business pretty much

smashes my plans for the next four months. After the election

I shall probably be free once more.  I fear I can't visit you as

I intended.--All well.

                         Affectionately,

  R. P. HAYES,                                               H.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 12, 1875.

  DEAR SIR: -- I regret that a previous engagement will prevent

me from delivering an address at the meeting of the Firelands

Historical Society. I am obliged to you for the invitation. Your









             <B>NOMINATED FOR GOVERNOR--JUNE, 1875          277</B>



society is doing a good work. It deserves encouragement both as

a historical and as a social institution. It is well to preserve, as

you are doing, recollections, memorials, and relics of the past,

and it is also a most excellent feature of your society that it

brings together in frequent social reunions the pioneers who are

so rapidly leaving us. I hope your meeting and society will be

altogether successful.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  June 13. -- I once in a while feel as if I might be called away

suddenly. If so, I want all of my boys to remember as my last

words to them: Always be honest in both deed and word; and

always be thoughtful, considerate, kind in your treatment of

your mother. I do not think any of you are lacking in integrity

or goodness to your mother, but I mention these two points to

impress them on your minds.  Don't forget them as you respect

me, and as you wish to deserve happiness,--and to deserve it

is the surest way to have it.





                            FREMONT, OHIO, June 13, 1875.

  MY DARLING:--The home is lonely without you. In short, it

is no home at all. But you'll soon return and how glad we will

all be.

  I have two very satisfactory letters this morning. One from

Nordhoff.  He says I have another friend on the Herald--

that he did not write that paragraph.  He has written one since

which has not yet got out here.  The other from Jacobi on the

German vote in Cincinnati.  He gives an encouraging account

of the situation. Judge Jones also writes a long and good letter.

He gives you credit for a full share of the enthusiasm of the

convention in my behalf.  He says, "The remark was heard on

every hand that good as General Hayes was, he was no better

than his wife." Now there!!









<B>278          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Give my love to the friends where you are and remember to

come home when you can to those who love you "s'much."

                          As ever,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES,

      Chillicothe.

Private.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, June 14, 1875.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I write you again so soon on account

of an editorial in the Ironton Journal.  It says:  "I wrote him

[Taft], went to see him, and induced him to be a candidate."

This is a total mistake. I had nothing to do with it. After he

was out and after he had written his explicit letter to Wheeler

on the school question, I thought it not just to oppose him in

the way it was done. My judgment was in favor of Horton

as our candidate. Having declined, as you know, at an early

day, I did not wish to have my name used against anybody. I

would have sent the same dispatches as to any other person,

if another had been prominent.

  I do not want to get into print about it. The sooner we drop

all discussion as to matters prior to the convention and go into

the fight as it stands, the better. Still I think this thing, in the

quietest way possible, ought to be corrected by a simple statement

of the truth. If you think the inclosed paragraph would do it,

and see no reason to the contrary, you may request the editor

to insert it. Give him my thanks for his very handsome and

graphic account of this thing, and for his hearty support.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  ["The inclosed paragraph" read as follows:--"In a former

issue we said in relation to Governor Hayes' support of Judge

Taft, that 'Hayes wrote to him, went to see him, and induced

him to let his name come before the convention. Hayes got

Noyes to work for Taft and between them persuaded the latter

to consent.' This we are informed is altogether a mistake. Gov-

ernor Hayes had nothing to do with bringing out Judge Taft.

After the judge wrote his explicit letter on the school question,

Governor Hayes, who admired the judge and was personally

kindly to him, expressed the hope that he would be nominated

and refused to allow his name to be used against the judge, but

he was in no way responsible for his being brought out a can-

didate."]

  DEAR SIR:--Your note and the newspaper slip came duly.

Both show you to possess education and talents. The sketch

of your history is interesting and is well calculated to enlist

sympathy in your behalf. If I were not a candidate, it is alto-

gether possible that your appeal for pecuniary aid would be favor-

ably considered. But a little reflection will, I am confident, lead

you to see that under the circumstances it is altogether out of

the question. Sound men of all parties are coming to the con-

clusion that the use of money by candidates, except in the

recognized public way for legitimate expenses, is a great evil

that ought to be abated. Believing this myself, I must say no,

hoping your cool judgment will approve the decision.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  W. J. TROY,

      Columbus, Ohio.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, June 19, 1875.

  MY DEAR W--:--I am in receipt of yours of the 17th. Glad

to see you are prompt. The doings of the 17th do not hurt.

But we have a big job. It can be done with work and we may

as well go at it. I will come down, via Newark, Wednesday

P. M. and stop at General Mitchell's, or Platt's. Can't you come

out, or tell Mitchell when I can see you Wednesday evening?

Please see General Mitchell and tell him where we may meet.

Fix to suit your convenience. I will remain all day Thursday.

No public demonstrations--no meetings.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Why not begin correspondence for speakers at once?

Make the appeals very urgent.

  CAPTAIN  A. T. WIKOFF,

       Columbus, Ohio.

Private and confidential.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 22, 1875.

  MY DEAR SIR:--A  personal article, in the Plain Dealer of

Saturday, on me is wholly untrue in both  of its branches.  I

did not lobby against, or in any way oppose, the Cleveland bill,

and I did not receive a horse for that or any other service.

  I am not personally acquainted with the Plain Dealer people,

but if their notions of partisan warfare allow them  to correct

errors in such cases, I can satisfy them in twenty minutes on

this head. I don't wish to trouble you with my affair, but if

you think they would do an adversary justice in such a case, I

will call to see them when next in Cleveland -- say the last of

this or early next week.

                                 Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Since writing I have seen the article in the Plain

Dealer on the powder bill. It is, as you know, altogether untrue.

I did not lobby at all on the powder bill.  I think I was not in

Columbus when it was pending.  I never spoke to a man about it.

I never opposed it by letter or otherwise.  You wrote me a letter,

very brief, saying you were apprehensive that in the excitement

of the time some unjust action would be had and requesting me

to write to the member from this county, and suggest to him de-

lay until all could be heard.  This is the substance.  I wrote a

short letter to the member from this county -- a Democrat -- a

man of good judgment.  I did not oppose any bill.  I suggested

delay and consideration.  If I used the words "dangerous legis-

lation," it was in such a connection as to show that I did not

apply it to any particular bill, but to hasty and ill-considered

action.  Mr. Inman replied briefly as to the character of the bill,

and I did not oppose it, or meddle in it at all.  There was, of

course, no gift of a horse, or anything else for this or any other

service.  The horse I bought at a fair price, etc., etc.









             <B>CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR--1875          281</B>



  Now if level-headed men think the thing ought to be noticed

at all, the foregoing contains the material for editorial denial by

our Republican press.  I do not propose to rush into print.

  If my letter is the basis, as it is, of all this, our friends can

safely challenge the production of the letter. I hope they have

not destroyed it.

  HONORABLE F. W. GREEN,

      Cleveland.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 22, 1875.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I have been shown an article which charges

that I lobbied against the Cleveland powder bill.  You know

this is untrue.  I wrote you a short letter, without any knowledge

of the bill, suggesting delay and consideration, etc., etc. And

after I got your letter telling me what was proposed, I dropped

the subject. It may be proper for my vindication that I have

the letters, or copies, that I wrote to you.  You will oblige me

by sending me [them] as soon as convenient.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE B. INMAN,

      Scott Township.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 28, 1875.

  MY  DEAR GENERAL:--I thank you for your letter of the

26th.  Our contest will be a hard one.  We must have a great

deal of work done to redeem the State. Our organization must

be reconstructed, and meetings held everywhere. Your ideas

as to our true policy are precisely mine.  We must attack.  Their

scheme for inflating our irredeemable paper currency is bad

enough; but there are debtors and speculators in large numbers

in Ohio who want it. They are not all Democrats. We shall lose

some votes on this question. The Catholic question is also in-

teresting the people very much. This seems to be thus far almost

wholly favorable.

  I trust you will make your arrangements to give us all your

time until the election.  We need it.

                           Sincerely,

  JAMES A. GARFIELD.                              R. B. HAYES.









<B>282          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                            FREMONT, OHIO, June 29, 1875.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am glad exceedingly that you will go to

Lawrence County [to open the campaign with me]. There are

many reasons for this.  It would please me and aid me greatly

if you could go with me to the other early meetings in that region.

The tariff and finances are controlling subjects in that region.

You can deal with them better than any other man. Since 1872

I have been so completely out of politics that I feel very lame.

I have never seen your last great financial measure fixing 1879

for a return to coin. Can you send it to me.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--We will go together from Cincinnati if you can.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                            FREMONT, OHIO, June 29, 1875.

  MY DEAR CAPTAIN:--I have yours of the 26th as to meetings

and speakers.  All satisfactory.  But I hear from Sherman that

he will go with me to Lawrence.  This is best.  I have written

to him requesting him to go with me to other places in that

region. When I hear I will let you know his decision.

  As among the other speakers you name, when Sherman leaves

me, I have no preference.

  Your idea of following Cary with Danforth is good. I go to

a pioneer meeting at Norwalk [the] 30th; to Springfield to a

centennial, [the] 3d, I believe it is; and on the 6th to [the]

dedication of [the] Soldiers' Monument at Findlay. Hands

full, you see.

                           Yours,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  A. T. WIKOFF.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 5, 1875.

  DEAR SIR:--I am obliged for the Globes. I expect to spend

a couple of days in Cincinnati soon, and will again as you suggest

meet you there a day or two before going to Ironton, at the

hotel you fix. I shall go to the Gibson House this time.









             <B>CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR--1875          283</B>



  I have a letter from Bundy, who is disturbed on the currency

question.  Judge Kelley is to speak on finances at Youngstown

the 10th on invitation of the iron men. Doubtless there are

localities where our position on [the] currency question will be

damaging, but on the whole it must help. At any rate, we are

right.                      Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                               FREMONT, OHIO, July 7, 1875.

  DEAR SIR:--I regard the present paper currency of the coun-

try as a good currency so long as there is no further inflation,

and with the understanding that until it is convertible into coin

at the will of the holder its volume shall not be increased.

A permanently irredeemable currency I look upon as unsafe and

unstable. I do not write this for publication. The public will

hear from me in due time in explicit terms.

                           Sincerely,

  REV. H. O. SHELDON,                            R. B. HAYES.

       Oberlin, Ohio.

                               FREMONT, OHIO, July 8, 1875.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am asked for a tract, or pamphlet on the

Geghan and school question so often that I now write to urge you

to have it out as soon as money can get it. It may be made up of

extracts from Little's omnibus pamphlet, and from the press, and

especially from the Catholic press. A mere document -- very

little fresh matter -- short and to be circulated everywhere.

Speak to Nash about it. Don't delay. Pay for it. In German

and English. I urge you not to allow this to pass unnoticed.

Nothing is so much desired and needed.

  All I see is encouraging.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Dr. Byers told me he thought of getting up a docu-

ment of this sort. Let it be done soon.

  CAPTAIN A. T. WIKOFF.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, July 10, 1875.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--I agree with you that we ought to have

Cary so followed. Would not Gibson be the right man?

  You suggest an important topic, but I fear I can't find time

to work it up. However, we must not let them select the topic.

We must not let the Catholic question drop out of sight. If they

do not speak of it, we must attack them for their silence. If

they discuss it, or refer to it, they can't help getting into trouble.

We can't, I think, do better than to stick to the texts, honest

money, and  no sectarian interference with the schools.

  At Findlay I saw many Republicans from the country. With-

out exception they were most interested in the last.

                           Sincerely,

  MAJOR W. D. BICKHAM,                             R. B. HAYES.

      Dayton.

                 CINCINNATI, GIBSON HOUSE, July 12, 1875.

  MY DARLING:--I spent Saturday in Toledo, principally with

political people. The mayor and a few of his German friends

talked over the situation fully and freely. All good.

    . . . Politically things here look well.  I breakfast this

morning with Nordhoff at Mrs. Davis'.  He  is expected this

morning from the South.

                                                          R.

  MRS. HAYES.



  July 18, 1875.  Sunday.--June and July thus far in Ohio have

been very wet; more rain than in the same period for some years.

  I am now crowded with work.  Getting ready for the canvass

which begins the 31st. Correspondence, business, and sickness

in my family.



                              FREMONT, OHIO, July 18, 1875.

  MY  DEAR  SIR: --  Yours of l6th at hand, also the pamphlets.

I think it would be a good idea to publish it also in parts.  One

part, so much as relates to the Geghan bill on pages 4-7.  This

makes a still shorter book. Don't fail to print such part sep-









             <B>CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR--1875          285</B>



arately with an appropriate heading connecting the Democrats

and Catholics in the matter.

   My youngest boy has taken the scarlet fever from his sister, 

and we are now all occupied with this. We hope it will be mild

with him also.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  CAPTAIN A. T. WIKOFF.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, July 19, 1875.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- Your letter will help me. You need not

be surprised if, during the canvass, you see your illustrations

in my "efforts." . . . I am now trying to cook up an opening

speech, but am not likely to do well.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, July 19, 1875.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Will you get Little or Nash to inform me as

to the chaplain in the Ohio Penitentiary. Does he draw his

salary? Do the Democratic directors and warden understand

that he is entitled to it?  I suppose he is but the Catholic Tele-

graph questions it. Was it understood when it was passed that

it touched this question?. . .

  I suggest that you continue to issue tracts on the school,

Geghan, etc., question. I would shorten them to four pages for

greater convenience. Do not hesitate about this. What is said

on the Geghan Bill in your former tract, under the headings

"The Geghan Bill" and "What the people thought of it," would

do well for one issue. There is an article in the last Harper's

Weekly, etc., etc.

  By reason of my child's sickness with scarlet fever requiring

constant attention, I may not be able to get a speech ready so

as to send the press advance copies. If so I will notify you and

let it be generally known next week.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.









<B>286          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  P. S. -- Can't you send your tracts to all of our meetings to

be distributed there by the committees? Is it not a good idea?

  CAPTAIN A. T. WIKOFF.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 20, 1875.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--. . .  It now looks as if the Democrats

meant to go hard money with Thurman in certain localities, soft

money with Cary in others, and all mixed up with Allen, etc.,

and in the State at large.

  The Catholic question, as I see it, still grows. I may be wrong,

but so it appears to

                        Sincerely

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MAJOR W. D. BICKHAM,

      Dayton.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, July 27, 1875.

  MY DEAR GUY:--I send you a copy of my campaign speech

to be delivered next Saturday. It was prepared under great

difficulties. Two of my children were down with scarlet fever.

One is still in bed but we hope slowly recovering.

  Thinking of you I put in a word about Texas. As to Southern

affairs "the let-alone policy" seems now to be the true course;

at any rate nothing but good-will now exists towards you. The

future depends largely on the moderation and good sense of

Southern men in the next House of Representatives. If they

are like Lamar, of Mississippi, all will be well. If like Preston,

of Virginia, all will be "fuss and fury" for a time. But I think

we are one people at last for all time.

                          As ever,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GUY M. BRYAN,

      Texas.

                 FREMONT, OHIO, Wednesday, July 28, 1875.

  DEAR COLONEL: -- I start via Toledo by night train to Cincin-

nati, expecting to leave Cincinnati by boat 4 P. M. tomorrow

for Ironton. This gives ample time to reach Marion, etc., etc.









             <B>CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR--1875          287</B>



  The boy is still in bed but so improved that I feel it is proper

to leave home.

  You had better send out your documents as fast as possible

and have the distribution well done. But this you are doing.

The short documents on the different phases of the school ques-

tion are the most effective, I have no doubt.

  Judge Taft at Chillicothe will do good I am sure.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  COLONEL A. T. WIKOFF.



                 IRONTON, Sunday A. M., August I, 1875.

  MY DARLING:--We have had a wonderful meeting at Marion

in the mud and rain, and a beautiful and successful meeting

here. We, Sherman and I, went out to Marion Friday night.

It is a village twice the size of Ballville--no more. Already

more people had gathered than at the Democratic meeting.

Cannon, hauled by soldiers sixteen miles in the mud and rain, a

band ditto, glee club, and solid farmers. The country is all

afloat. One and three-tenths inches [of rain] fell that night. At

daylight they began to come. The Times ought to have it all,

or nearly all. Several hundred of Fifth Virginia, Second Vir-

ginia, etc., etc., filed into my room and such a hand-shaking I

never had before. No speech was finished. Rain, rain and mud,

mud, but it was jolly. Processions, ten or twelve, came from

ten to fifteen miles. Old men called it 1840. I came into town

[Ironton] covered with mud and teaed with Mrs. Enochs.  Am

now at the finest home, Hiram Campbell's, where I stopped in

1867. . . .

  We have had the finest possible send-off. A Hayes Club in

every ward and township.--I go to Portsmouth for tomorrow

evening.

  1 P. M.--At Presbyterian Church with Mrs. Campbell and

daughter.  The preacher was an old college friend, a much

valued man--Calhoun. Saw Major Carey of Twenty-third at

church. . . .









<B>288          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  PORTSMOUTH, Monday, August 2.  11 A. M.--Just arrived

here in good condition and prospects good.

                           S'much.

  MRS. HAYES.                                       R. B. H.



  Portsmouth, August 3. -- Had a fine meeting.  Numbers, en-

thusiasm, and other cheering indications. Nothing better since

1866, certainly. It is like a Presidential year. Judge Town,

Colonel Coats, Captain Gibbs, [and] Mr. Dene, the active men.

With McFarland, Judge Thompson. etc., to General Kinney's

sightly place.  Saw his deer park and curiosities gathered from

the trip immortalized as "Innocents Abroad."

  Beaver, August 4.--Left Portsmouth yesterday with Mr.

J. Q. Gibson and Loomis in a carriage via Valley Pike to Pike-

ton.  Floods destroying corn by the thousand acres.  No meeting

deemed best at Piketon, but in the afternoon so many came in,

notwithstanding the floods, that we had a good meeting in the old

court-house. Then by carriage here, ten miles.

  Genterton  [Centerville], Gallia County, at Mr. Beaman's,

August 5, 1875.--Came from Jackson last evening with Mr.

Beaman, also Judge Lawrence and Fursey.  A good meeting

here last night, also at Jackson P. M.

  August 6.  Friday, 8:30 A. M.--Steamer Chesapeake with

Judge Lawrence. A good meeting yesterday at Gallipolis. The

only meeting not so good (yet) as it should be was at Jackson.

A long procession under Colonel Cadot came out to meet us to-

wards Centerton.  Stayed at Esquire Perry's; saw Nash., etc.,

etc.  Left Gallipolis last night at 12 midnight.  The meeting at

Pomeroy, fixed for today, postponed because of the flood. Passed

at daylight Pomeroy and Middleport; saw the mayor, young

Horton, etc., etc. We are now trying to reach Athens via

Parkersburg.



              PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA, August 7, 1875.

  DEAR COLONEL: -- Lawrence speaks so effectively that he can

run a line of meetings alone or any way. Keep him at work.









             <B>CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR--1875          289</B>



  Tell people to advertise by posters and especially in county

paper. Jackson meeting not so good for want of this. Gallipolis

and Centerton meetings in Gallia both very large.  We go to

Athens immediately.

                                                    HAYES.

  COLONEL A. T. WIKOFF.



            PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA, August 7, [1875].

  DARLING:--We go this morning to Athens. Came this way

as the only chance.  Pomeroy under water and no meeting yes-

terday. A fine large meeting at Gallipolis in spite of flood.

Shook hands with two hundred and six colored voters of a

Hayes Club, and lots of their wives, etc., also a host of others.

All looks encouraging. Got a slight cold, but on the whole well.

  ATHENS, 7th, 10 A. M. -- I get two letters here. . . .  We

have had great meetings except when the floods have prevented.

                                                        H.

  MRS. HAYES.



  Athens, Lunatic Asylum, Sunday, August 8, 1875.--Came

over after meeting last night with Dr. Gundry to this new in-

stitution. Yesterday from Parkersburg to Athens by 10 A. M.

Found the meeting not advertised on account of the flood, ex-

cept in a limited way. A small meeting. Made a sober, strong,

but dull speech. In the evening Judge Lawrence did much better.

There is also difficulty on the representative nomination.  The

outlook here is not bright.  I think it will heal.  The Enquirer

prints Colonel Burns' handsome note in issue of 7th. (This at

6 A. M.)





                   ATHENS, Sunday A. M., August 8, 1875.

  MY DEAR COLONEL: -- Our meetings here, owing chiefly to the

flood, lack of notice, etc., etc., were poor. There is still a sour

feeling over local troubles. But it needs attention. A good

meeting with a popular speaker three or four weeks or more

hence will, I think, straighten all.

    19









<B>290          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  A cold makes me dull. It will soon wear off no doubt, but you

must see that my colleague is always on hand. Lawrence made

a capital speech at the evening meeting. Keep him at work.

  I have read the Mansfield letter again. Why not ask him to

prepare the little pamphlet on the Catholic and school question?

I would unite in his suggestions. Think of it. No time is to be

lost. Here, as elsewhere, they tell me that is the topic people

want to hear about.

                           Yours,

                                                         H.

  COLONEL A. T. WIKOFF.

                               CALDWELL, August 11, 1875.

  DEAR COLONEL:--The meetings here and at Marietta were

good--not very large--but under the circumstances satisfac-

tory. In both counties the prospect is encouraging. Dalzell will

run rather ahead and is quite sure to be elected. I go via

Cambridge to Zanesville today.

  The Toledo meeting, August 21, you must quietly drop unless

it is extremely difficult. Can't get home that night or next day.

Toledo is one of my homes; it is too early, and I now see the

run of the canvass. It is not necessary to overwork me. Let

me off easily. Mansfield is right. We win or lose on the

circulation of the document, or such documents as he spoke of.

  Get me out of the Toledo meeting and as many others as you

can.

                                                    HAYES.

  COLONEL A. T. WIKOFF.

                               CAMBRIDGE, August 12, 1875.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--. . .  We had a good meeting last night

at Zanesville. Generally the outlook is favorable. Mr. Eggleston

is with me. I am to be at home, as I understand arrangements,

about the last of next week. Perhaps it would please Birch to

take a tour with me. If so, let him be ready to join me for a

week or so when I get around home.

  I am having a comfortable time. My health and voice hold out

well. Nothing but the taking a bad cold, of which there is al-









             <B>CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR--1875          291</B>



ways some danger, is likely to prevent me from getting through

with this job pretty well. . . .

                       Affectionately,

                                                        H.

  WEBB C. HAYES.

                                BELLEAIR, August 14, 1875.

  MY DARLING: -- I spoke twice yesterday at good meetings in

the open air. . . . I stand it well.  My speaking is irregular.

Sometimes quite good, sometimes not, but generally will do. It

will be good to be with you again. I am too far along in ex-

perience and years both for this business. I do not go into [it]

with the zest of old times. Races, baseball, and politics are for

the youngsters.

                          As ever,

                                                        H.

  MRS. HAYES.





  August 15. Sunday.  Mount Pleasant, Jefferson County. -- At

Dr. J. T. Updegraff's. A good meeting at Steubenville yesterday;

Judge Miller, president. Saw Mrs. Webster. Mr. Eggleston

left me there. Came over with Dr. Updegraff, fourteen miles

south to Short Creek and six miles out here by buggy and team.

Lovely scenes of mountains, etc. Gill and others called. Talked

from the steps a moment only.

  Today at Friends' Church; four ladies and four gentlemen,

spoke, etc., one and one-half hours, as at Methodist Episcopal

Church class or experience meetings. A famous old antislavery

town. Home of Lundy and of a host of famous people.

  August 17, 1875.  Massillon. -- From Mount Pleasant with

Dr. Updegraff to Cadiz, 16th A. M. Spoke to a good crowd



in front of the court-house at 1:30 P. M.  By railroad to

Ulrichsville.  A  spontaneous  [meeting]  at Ulrichsville.    A

good meeting and a speech from a drygoods box in front of

Birney House at night. This A. M. here via New Philadelphia,

etc. An express wagon to the hotel.









<B>292          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  August 18, 1875. -- At New Milan 5:30 A. M., ready to go to

Medina.  We had a magnificent meeting last night in the Opera

House [at Massillon]. Delegations and bands from Canton, Al-

liance, etc. Tea with Mr. Wales. Colonel Grosvenor, of Mis-

souri, sick, a bright handsome man.  McKinley here.  Feeling

good. Prospects ditto.



                               FREMONT, August 22, 1875.

  MY DEAR COLONEL:--The programme for meetings received

in the daily Journal last night is all right as far as I am con-

cerned.

  We have had encouraging meetings, in the main, so far. Nor-

walk was not good. It is a mistake for the local committee to

get up a night meeting after a day meeting in the same town.

The town people neglect the day meeting, the country people the

night meeting, and thus both suffer.

  Williams County was like Gallia and Lawrence -- wide-awake.

A Granger of note told me our meeting would have had the

same attendance without the Grange. It was very large.

  Dalzell is nervous about the Reunion. Thinks Allen and Com-

pany will be there and capture it.  Perhaps it would be best to

send some of our best soldiers and speakers to represent us.

Can't Noyes, Gibson, Young, Grosvenor, Keifer, etc., etc., or

some of them go? Try to see that we are represented. Noyes

or Gibson, either, would do splendidly, and spike the enemy's

guns.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  Can you manage to send to me here, any time, a complete set

of campaign documents on both sides -- Democrat and Repub-

lican?

  COLONEL A. T. WIKOFF.



   [Throughout September and till the election, Hayes was con-

tinuously in the campaign, speaking nearly every day, and often

more than once, in all parts of Ohio, and everywhere to large

audiences. The Diary is silent and letters few and brief.]









             <B>CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR--1875          293</B>



                         FREMONT, OHIO, September 12, 1875.

  DEAR NASH:--I will telegraph you in the morning to do as

you think best about the appointments. I will be content with

your arrangements.

  I am disappointed in my money arrangements here.  My ab-

sence has turned me financially topsy-turvy for the present.  No

permanent loss, but delay. I can't now respond to your calls, so

don't make any, but push for funds East or somewhere. Nothing

but inflation will relieve me for the next few months!

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES

  P. S.--An absurd "tissue of falsehoods" leads me to say I

voted every time against and not for the salary increase of 1866.

I was elected the first election after its passage by a large ma-

jority--and in the same district in 1867 received a large majority

for governor. To say I am a "grabber" is a foolish falsehood.

But I deny nothing.  I leave the facts to friends.--H.



                   YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO, September 20, 1875.

  DEAR COLONEL:--Glad to know by your dispatch that Mr.

Schurz will give us nine speeches.  It will be of great importance.

I would suggest that you consider Toledo, Sandusky, Akron,

and Cleveland as among the points. Here there is still a large

defection of Republicans. People [are] carried off by the cry of

hard times to be relieved by inflation. Allen helped us here.

But it is bad enough yet. I think we are gaining.--I go to

Canfield this morning.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Our meeting here was an exceedingly fine one.

  COLONEL A. T. WIKOFF.



                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 27, 1875.

  MY DARLING: -- Sitting at Laura's desk in the pleasant library,

before breakfast, with a lovely bright morning outside, I think

of home and wish you were here or I there.









<B>294          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Only two weeks more of this work! I have had a good time

the last week. The great Warren meeting will stand as the

greatest meeting on the Western Reserve; 1840 and 1863 were

both eclipsed. There I staid with Senator Jones. He and his

wife and the little folks are delightful people.

  Twenty-thirders at Ashland, and others, made that a happy

time. At Mount Vernon I spent the night out on Mr. Delano's

farm. Mrs. Delano seems happy as the manager of a large

household and will enjoy their fine place and her grandchildren

far more than Washington.

  I speak here tonight and then go via Circleville, etc., etc., to

Cincinnati, staying there next Sunday. After that a week more,

and home! How I long for it! On the whole the canvass must

be put down as a pleasant one. But I am eight or ten years too

old and wise to fail to see the other side of the shield. . . .

  It is thought that Governor Woodford will speak in Fremont

the night before the election. He suggests that it is the usage

to have a meeting at the residence of the candidate for speakers

from abroad. If this is done, of course we ought to entertain

Governor Woodford. . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                                         R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                  TOLEDO, October 7, 1875.

  MY DARLING:--I have letters from Webb and Birch and am

glad to hear of your welfare.  I begin to feel nearly free again.

This morning I go to Wauseon and Napoleon. Will leave

Napoleon tomorrow morning and expect to pass Fremont in the

noon train Friday, that is tomorrow, to speak at Milan that day

or evening, and Saturday at Elyria, in the evening at Oberlin,

and I hope to get home in the 10 or 11 o'clock night train that

night. The topics have got to be dull to me, and I am not now

speaking my best. My health is good. Occasional colds make

me a little hoarse, but on the whole I am doing well.

  . . . If you or either of the boys wish to go on with me









             <B>ELECTED GOVERNOR--OCTOBER, 1875          295</B>



[tomorrow] all right. But at any rate we are soon together

again, and that will be a happiness to

                     Yours affectionately,



  MRS. HAYES.





  October 12, 1875.--Election day! The weather is perfect.

Spiegel Grove, my home, never looked so beautiful before. I

am as nearly indifferent, on personal grounds, to the result of

this day as it is possible to be. I prefer success. But I anticipate

defeat with very great equanimity. If victorious, I am likely

to be pushed for the Republican nomination for President.

This would make my life a disturbed and troubled one until

the nomination, six or eight months hence. If nominated, the

stir would last until November a year hence. Defeat in the next

Presidential election is almost a certainty. In any event, defeat

now returns me to the quiet life I sought in coming here.

  The large considerations of country, patriotism, and principle

find little place in a deliberation on this question. The march

of events will carry us safely beyond the dangers of the present

questions.

  October 17, 1875. -- Elected.  A pleasant serenade from my

neighbors; a day of doubt and anxiety as to the result. It looked

on Thursday as if the Democrats were bent on counting me out.

All right, however. Now come papers from all the country

counties urging me for the Presidential nomination. Such as

the following list:--Cincinnati Times, Toledo Blade, Dayton

Journal, Springfield Republic, Ashtabula Sentinel, Fremont

Journal, Kenton Republican, Bellefontaine Republican, Clinton

Republican, Pickaway Herald and Union.
