  NOVEMBER 5, 1889.  Tuesday. -- The election day in many

States. . . .     The Democrats seem to be in the best condi-

tion. There is the usual dissatisfaction to weaken the party in

power by reason of the spoils doctrine. Then the dismissal of

Tanner hurts with the soldiers. Governor Foraker leans too

much towards the boss system and spoils system. He is influ-

enced greatly by this. He is brilliant, witty, eloquent, and very

popular with the hurrah boys, but the sober and conservative ele-

ment of the party dislike his methods and would be glad to see

him run behind the ticket. Some want him beaten and votes will

be lost. I hope we shall carry the State -- elect Governor For-

aker and the whole ticket, securing the Senator, etc., etc. But I

am not at all confident.

  Thinking of prohibition: As now understood, it is not radical.

It is compromising; it stops at a half-way house. It is only

half prohibition--it favors half of the liquor traffic.  It pro-

hibits only selling. It does not stop or try to stop buying. This

is our human way of doing things. We know there would be

no unchaste women if there were no impure men. But we con-

demn the prostitute, thrust her in prison, cast stones at her;

but we ask the man, who is equally to blame, to dine at our

tables!  Addressing my young friends, I ask your attention to

the words of an old radical. I want no debate. The debating

room has its value. But it is no place to form wise opinions.

The air is too heated--too full of electricity. When you wish

                         <B>(521)</B>









<B>522          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to reach sound conclusions, keep cool. Sleep or be calm enough

to sleep on what you hear.

  A generation ago, I had hope and faith in the Maine Law. I

was as zealous in its behalf as you are now.  But mark my words.

It is in the long run the demand that brings the supply. Where

there are no buyers there will be no sellers. Where there are

many buyers there will be sellers in spite of your laws. To the

vice and crimes of drink, you will add the crimes of law-

breaking, of perjury, of hypocrisy, of meanness.

  Beware of compromise measures; beware of the half-way

houses on the road to vice and crime. You cannot make fish of

one and flesh of the other. If you would stamp out vice, you

must punish equally the equally guilty. As a general statement,

the moral turpitude of the buyer is greater than the moral tur-

pitude of the seller.

  November 6. Wednesday. -- The Democrats seem to have

carried everything. If the reports of this afternoon are correct,

they have the state ticket and legislature as well as the govern-

orship. It was anticipated that Foraker would be beaten, but

it was hoped that the state ticket and legislature might be saved.

It is useless to spend time on causes. They are easily seen.

Rutherford suggests one consolation for this household:--"It

leaves you the only governor ever elected for a third term"!

Small favors, etc.

  November 9.  Saturday. -- The Democrats celebrate their vic-

tory today. Our gifted and brilliant governor is very enthusiasti-

cally supported by the strong party men. He is an extreme par-

tisan, and those who are like him in this respect stick to him.

But, as often happens with such men, he is unpopular at the

polls--more so than Blaine; as much so as Conkling would

have been in a state or national election. He is lacking in sober

judgment.  His partisanship blinds him--makes him an unsafe

leader, and his bitter sarcasm excites a corresponding animosity

against him.  It was unwise to run him a third time.

  My gallant comrade of the Thirty-fourth-Thirty-sixth Ohio,

the color-bearer of the regiment at Sheridan's victory of Win-

chester, is turned out, or surely will be, of his place by the politi-









             <B>FORAKER'S CHARACTERISTICS          523</B>



cal cyclone of Tuesday. Another example of the wretchedness

of the spoils system. I have written at his request to Colonel

McClung to do the best he can for him.  But Colonel McClung

has his duties and his committals.

  November 10.  Sunday.--Church with Fanny.  In the after-

noon Mr. and Mrs. Bristol called. Mrs. Bristol attended the

Woman's Home Missionary annual meeting at Indianapolis. She

described with spirit the various scenes in the convention which

were of special interest. The memorial meeting as to Mrs.

Hayes was a beautiful and affecting scene. Mrs. Davis deliv-

ered a touching address. As I read it aloud to Fanny and Ruth-

erford the tears would flow and my voice faltered.

  Just received a dispatch from Green Clay Goodloe that his

brother has died--Colonel William Cassius Goodloe--from

wound received in the bloody encounter with Colonel Swope in

the Lexington post-office last week, and requesting me as the

wish of the family to act as an honorary pall-bearer. I have no

disposition to refuse. Our relations with the deceased and his

family are friendly, not to say intimate, He was appointed by

me minister to Belgium. He was a frequent attendant as a com-

panion of the Loyal Legion in the Ohio Commandery of which

I was commander. He placed his daughter in my charge when

she went to school at Farmington, Connecticut, when my daugh-

ter was also going to school. His daughter visited Fanny here

afterwards for a week or more. Fanny was her bridesmaid

when she, Miss Goodloe, was married last summer.

  Can I not make this the occasion for a word or two some-

where in favor of a reform in the Kentucky public sentiment

which has caused this fearful tragedy.  I do not undertake--I

do not assume--to apportion the blame for this awful and lam-

entable event between the community, on the one side, and those

two unfortunate gentlemen, on the other.  I know not how many

hearts are crushed and almost broken. I know not what large

circle of relatives and friends are now in deepest affliction by rea-

son of the death of these two Kentucky gentlemen. May I not ask

you to hear a word, not of blame, not even of advice, but of en-

treaty, that this event may lead to a pause, to reflection, [to] a









<B>524          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



change in public sentiment ? Will not every good Kentuckian, every

brave man, every good woman, resolve that, from henceforth

always, the man who firmly refuses to seek to take life, or to

risk life in any form on any merely personal account, for any

personal offense or insult, shall be sustained and held in full re-

spect and honor as a gentleman altogether worthy?

  November 17.  Sunday.  Nashville.--Left home last Mon-

day. . . .  [Tuesday  at]  Lexington,  attended  funeral  of

Colonel Goodloe. Visited monument to Henry Clay. Supper at

Dr. Skilman's. All exceedingly pleasant.

  [Wednesday], called an hour on Mrs. Goodloe.  A cruel trag-

edy for her and the whole household.

  Evening back to Cincinnati to Aunty Davis', where I found

Fanny.  [On the] 15th reached Nashville, Maxwell House, an

excellent hotel, at 5 P. M.

  A goodly number of prison people here. The local historian,

Dr. Lindsley, and General Wheeliss has [have] charge of us.

Last evening a large and very fine meeting in spite of the cold

rain.  Well received.  A lovely basket of flowers given me by

the ladies of the Hermitage Association through Colonel Col-

yar.

  Rev. Dr. Fitzgerald in the McK---- Church (Methodist Epis-

copal, South) preached to a vast crowd an excellent prison re-

form sermon.

  Nashville, November 18.  Monday.--We  found  [yesterday

afternoon] a good industrial school for boys, not convicts, but

needing a home either from poverty or from  incorrigibility.

Founded by Mr. Cole and sustained by the State.

  One of our old and good wardens had a return of former

drinking habits, and after speaking indiscreetly for five minutes

he was sung down! This puts us even with our Nashville friends

-- we match their drunken mayor with our drunken warden.

  Excellent papers in our first meeting in the State-house by

Felton and Smead.  Both especially marked by all good qualities.

  Afternoon, visited [the] chaplains' meeting. [At] 6:30 P. M.,

with General Wheeliss and Fanny and General Brinkerhoff

called on Mrs. President Polk. A noble specimen of a very aged









             <B>PRISON CONGRESS IN NASHVILLE          525</B>



lady -- intelligent, spirited, cheerful, and cultured. Her adopted

daughter and daughter, Mrs. and Miss Pall, and Mr. Pall all

agreeable and the ladies very beautiful.

  Evening meeting, Dr. Cunningham, of Alabama, showed up

in a lively way the horror of the lease system in Alabama.

  At 9 P. M. with George H. Thomas Post G. A. R.; told the

story of Lucy's last day with the G. A. R., Memorial Day, at

Sandusky!!  Full of emotion!  Alas!

  November 24.  Cincinnati.  Sunday.--At   our   old-time

friends, Dr. John and Mrs. Davis'. Reached here about 8 P. M.

last night after an agreeable ride from Nashville with Fanny.

  Our Prison Congress was an unusually good one; good papers,

liberal sentiments, harmony, and good social relations.      The

South was well represented by men of excellent purposes. We

all left Nashville with pleasant impressions of that fine city in

spite of most unfortunate weather.

  The Peabody committee were unanimous in taking the first

steps looking to the final adoption of Nashville as the site of the

final Peabody memorial--the establishment of "The Peabody

Normal College."--Present, Bishop Whipple, Governor Porter,

Dr. Green, Dr. Curry, and myself. Absent, Senator Gibson.

  Friday in spite of illness I visited the college. Much pleased.

President and Mrs. Payne well fitted for their high duties.

three hundred and thirty students, two-thirds female, already

there. I anticipate the growth of a great institution--the best

of its sort anywhere. We appropriated about seventeen thousand

dollars as the beginning.

  November 29.  Saturday  [Friday].--I bought "The Light

of Asia" by Edwin Arnold and shall read it next.

  I must now take up resolutely my correspondence, neglected

for three weeks. Every morning and until noon I will work.

  December 1, 1889.  Sunday.-- Miller,  Aunt  Nancy,  and

Mary dined with us. Solomon's Temple, no larger, Aunt Nancy

says, than the Presbyterian church in this town! Where did the

one hundred and fifty thousand men work?

  Evening with Bristol, Drs. John and Robert Rice. Spirit by









<B>526          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



induction "knows other spirits." An interesting talk on im-

mortality.  All things are alive--all things are eternal.

  December 2.  Monday.--Mrs. Mame  [Minnie]  Manly, the

eldest of the daughters of Uncle Scott, with Nellie here.

Brought back my loss more sharply than before in many weeks.

  I saw a note also by Lucy showing her delight in the new im-

provements of our home, coupled with a few words of doubt

whether she will [should] live to see them finished! The ache

all came back to me! Tears were swimming again all day.

  December 4. Wednesday. -- I wrote to Wines, Sanborn,

Wayland, and Round of National Prison Association matters to-

day. My effort is to encourage and to harmonize.

  Read the President's message.  All who supported him have

reason to congratulate themselves and him upon it. I am par-

ticularly pleased with his treatment of so many questions that I

hesitate to particularize. But I will venture to thank him for

his [words in favor of] aid to education in the South.





          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 5, 1889.

  MY DEAR PRESIDENT:--I read your message from an official

copy last night. All who supported you--as I see it, all good

citizens -- have great reason to congratulate themselves and you

on your excellent message.  I am particularly pleased with your

treatment of so many questions that I hesitate to specify.

  But I must thank you for your wise and efficient aid to edu-

cation in the South.

  Please do not feel called on to reply.

                     Very sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  PRESIDENT HARRISON.



  December 5.  Thursday.--Wrote to Mrs. Herron as to our

Chautauqua manner of reading Emerson. We began with his

essay on "Immortality." We are so far only wiser in knowing

more fully how little can be really known on this deep question.









             <B>EMERSON ON IMMORTALITY          527</B>



                                 SPIEGEL, December 5, 1889.

  DEAR MRS. HERRON:--My intentions were good. Your letter

on the essay of Emerson was to the point and set me to reading.

Having given to "Immortality" a second hearing, I was ready

to reply. But alas, all sorts of claims came down on me. I

spent Thanksgiving with Mary and Birch and the boy. While

there I got hold of Edwin Arnold's "Light of Asia." Instantly

I was switched off into Buddhism. I read all of the notes. Some

touched on our question. I was greatly attracted. Now I am

mixed. But I must begin.

  There is nothing consecutive in Emerson. He is often ob-

scure.  Sometimes, perhaps, -- precious confession, -- unmean-

ing. He will not change our faith; he will not lead us to any

faith.  But I insist that we shall be more and more content with

God, with the future, with this whole bow-wow.  We shall have

more charity for others' errors. We shall have fewer errors of

our own. Therefore let us read him. I have gone next to "In-

spiration." But you will ask, Are you done with "Immortality?"

Yes, for now! We can return to it.

  What are the results so far? I am sure you have them all.

There is no assurance of the great fact in question [namely,

immortality].   All  the  arguments  are  mere  probabilities,

analogies, fancies, whims. We believe, or disbelieve, or are in

doubt according to our own make-up--to accidents, to educa-

tion, to environment. For myself, I do not reach either faith or

belief in the fact in its true sense, viz., that I--the conscious

person talking to you--will meet you in the world beyond--

you being yourself a conscious person -- the same person now

reading what I say.

  Do you ask, What have we gained? Not much, I admit. But

it is something to know, that with the best mind of our time

and race, we do not know. I confess that I have a "longing

after immortality," in the ordinary sense of the word. But I

am far more content with whatever may come since I have

read Emerson's calm, quiet, self-satisfied way of dealing with the

deepest questions. It is something to trust God.

  Now, shall we try "Inspiration"? You sit at the helm. Choose









<B>528          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



as you are inclined. I will insist that the more we read of Emer-

son the better we will like him; the wiser we will be; the better

we will find ourselves; and, by consequence (if anything is con-

sequence), the happier. Which is one of the aims--the chief

aim being to become better, to get character.

  But I am almost giving you drivel when you want thought.

And you deserve thought. You have such a good head.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. HARRIET C. HERRON,

    Cincinnati.



        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 5, 1889.

  MY DEAR GUY: -- I have yours of the 30th ultimo. Fanny and

I spent three weeks in Lexington, Cincinnati, and Nashville last

month, and upon the whole very pleasantly. The bereavement

returns in full force at irregular but lengthening intervals. Last

Monday, the coming of two of the kinsfolk who were favorites

with Lucy brought it all back with unabated pangs. Then it will

occur that for hours I am free from the grief and happy once

more. I find new reasons for consolation as time passes. No

end to the kind things coming from unexpected quarters. All

facts tending to her honor are full of contentment for me. The

tears flow unbidden when I least look for them.

  You are indeed fortunate in the continued health of yourself

and your brothers. My kindest regards to them. I feel an in-

creasing interest in your State. It is like one of my homes. At

the Nashville Prison meeting I met McCulloch of one of your

prisons. It was like meeting a comrade of the war.

  All who are connected with you, the Ballingers [and] those

of your name, are all in the inner circle of those I prize.

  I send herewith some photographs -- of small account to you,

but it is a pleasure to send them.

                   With old time affection,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.









             <B>EMERSON ON IMMORTALITY          529</B>



         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 5, 1889.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:--Your letter, before I went South, came

duly.  Fanny and I had a most enjoyable time--specially so.

  I am now at home for the winter--barring a trip or two to

Columbus, to Cleveland, Toledo, and possibly, to see you quietly

at Chicago.

  I would like to read something by the lady you speak of before

meeting her. After meeting her we shall be committed shall we

not?. . .

  I have at longer intervals a return of the feeling that nothing

is left -- nothing important.

               With all regard. Ever sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



  December 7.  Saturday. -- The Methodist Episcopal Church

is losing its hold on the people by its greed for gold and for

power in partisan politics. Money and partisanship are its twin

evils. During the war it drove out all Democrats and now it is

expelling all Republicans. Its anxiety for the million! Not the

million of souls but for the million of dollars!



                                  SPIEGEL, December 9, 1889.

  MY DEAR AUNTY DAVIS: -- I will try to keep in mind the case

of our friend, if I shall be called on to act. I return the letter.

  As to the other matter, I see no objection unless it is in what

I told you, that another friend has our assurance that all we

have is at his disposal for the purpose of a biography. I will

meditate on it, and in due time advise you. The visits here

and all such details can be arranged to suit.

  Yes, the gloom of these days -- the loneliness of them! Some-

times I think the pangs are deeper now, but they are less fre-

quent.

                         Ever sincerely,

  MRS. E. G. DAVIS,                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

    Cincinnati.

                                 SPIEGEL, December 9, 1889.

  MY DEAR FRIEND: -- I was meditating on your letter when the

enclosed came from our dear friend, Auntie Davis. She deliv-

ered a memorial address before the Woman's Home Missionary

Society, at Indianapolis. It was good; so good that the hearers

wanted it published with additions as an "In Memoriam." She

spoke to me about it. I assented to her wish to have some items.

Now it has blossomed out into what you see. I have written a

non-committal reply in which I say, "I have assured a friend

that all we have (material, etc., etc.) is at his disposal." I will

move slowly. Please return my letter from "Aunty" Davis.

  We must meet to talk this over. As it is my affair I will come

to Chicago, [or] meet you at Cleveland or Cincinnati or wher-

ever it will be most convenient for you within a month or two.

                       Ever sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.





  December  10.    Tuesday.--Busy  with  correspondence  and

bringing up arrears of all sorts. Since the sad days in June con-

fusion has held possession of my papers and affairs generally. I

now begin again to take hold. Henry Howe, the author of

"Ohio Historical Collections," of more than forty years ago, and

[who] now has issued the first volume of a revision, came last

night. He wants a loan of five hundred dollars from each of

twelve friends, secured by a deposit in trust with George W.

Sinks, of Columbus, of the plates of the work. I must of course

be one of the lenders. He is now seventy-three years of age and

time begins to tell on his mind and energy. But I hope he will

pull through.

  December 11. Wednesday.--If he [Howe] gives a sketch of

my life, why not let him say of my military career, it was wholly

in the grade of colonel; and certainly very few--perhaps no

colonel--had a more fortunate and conspicuous military record.

Grant said of him [Hayes] -- [Quotation not given.]









             <B>WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN          531</B>



       SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 13, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR:--It was simply out of the question for me to

attend the centennial observance by Congress. Of course I am

glad to be remembered in that connection. It is hardly probable

that I shall visit Washington this winter; but at some time, I

hope it will be convenient for you and Mrs. Sherman to receive

me again as your guest, when it is practicable for me to come.

  With thanks for your valued invitation.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



  December 17.  Tuesday. -- Lieutenant Kennon went over the

war papers relating to the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864.

His point is to show the value of Crook's services. No doubt he

[Crook] originated the flank movement at Opequon--the first

great victory.

  December 18.  Wednesday.--All day, with swimming eyes,

arranging papers and scraps-encomiums on my darling. Never

felt her absence more. Dear friends called; gave pictures of her

to Mrs. Shomo, who full of sympathy told of seeing her in her

dreams.

  Read Hawthorne's "American Notes," and Emerson's "Great

Men." Must repeat his talk of Lincoln.

  I have the idea that the incarnation of Washington and his

memorial was the Society of the Cincinnati; the embodiment of

Lincoln, his memorial, is the Loyal Legion. His ideas, his aims,

are our ideas, our aims. Washington sought independence, na-

tionality; Lincoln, liberty, equality of rights, the Golden Rule.

  December 19. Thursday. -- President Bashford, of Delaware,

came about 7:15. A healthy talk until 11 P. M. Gave him my

ideas on the injury done to the Methodist Episcopal Church by

politics in the pulpit. Also a full talk on the great question of

the future:  How  to equalize more fairly the distribution of

wealth.  How to get for the laborer his share of the wealth he

creates.









<B>532          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Was glad to find that he agreed with me on both questions,

viz., pulpit politics and the danger of wealth in a few hands.

  December 20. Friday. -- Spent the forenoon with President

Bashford, chiefly talking of the public men I had met, and of the

critical questions dealt with during my Administration. He spoke

of the interest and importance of a full account of these events

by my hand. Afternoon, correspondence and arranging books

and papers, sadly confused since the death of my darling wife.

  December 21. -- Six months ago today Lucy received her

fatal stroke about 4 P. M. This recalls her last conscious day

on earth! My tears flow as freely as ever today. I would not

call her back, but alas, how empty--how lonely the world is

without her!

  December 22. Sunday. -- I heard yesterday evening of the

death in Washington of Mrs. E. F. Andrews. This charming

and beautiful lady was one of Lucy's nearest friends in Wash-

ington. When Lucy died she was in such a critical condition

that she was not told of the death of Mrs. Hayes. Now she has

gone! I must write to Mr. Andrews.

  December 24.  Tuesday. -- I was most agreeably surprised in

the afternoon by Mary with Birchard and the boy coming into

the house, all in good health and spirits, to spend the Christ-

mas with us! It will make the day happier. Nothing can drive

away the sadness that comes to me in these days.  But the dear

one is more and more prized with a sweeter sorrow.

  December 26.  Thursday.--A good letter from Aunty Her-

ron on the essay of Emerson on "Inspiration." We are reading

Emerson together. She finds, I am glad to know, that Emerson

"lifts her out of the life of trifles and gain and comfort,"

and "fills her with rest and content." "A confirmed disciple

even at this late day." This is hopeful. Better far than doubt,

and agnosticism.



                                SPIEGEL, December 26, 1889.

  MY DEAR MRS. HERRON:--Your letter on the Emerson essay

is interesting. You write a great deal in a few words. It is









             <B>EMERSON ON INSPIRATION          533</B>



a special satisfaction to find you so fully appreciating the al-

most infinite worth of his writings. "Rest and content" and to

be "lifted above trifles"--is not this all that is best in religion,

whether natural or supernatural? I suspect I fail to "guess" the

nature of your reflections as you read the fine talk (p. 260):

"What is a man good for without enthusiasm?" etc., etc. "The

moth flies into the flame of the lamp," etc. I agree fully with

him and you on conversation. (276) "One hour sitting on a log

with Mark Hopkins is worth more than a week of the great

college with all its 'facilities.' "

  You find obscure passages. Is not the one at page 257 simply

the assertion that in our "happy moments" -- when we are poets

--when inspiration is with us, everything we see or think, or

conceive of, is "expected"?--is a matter of course? And in

like manner, at 261, "ecstasy will be found normal" -- that is ac-

cording to law -- natural, as the falling of a stone?

  I am afraid you will find me shallow -- too thin. For example,

at page 264, what is the "risk"? Is it anything more than the

insanity of extreme exaltation? Talking on in this way smacks

of egotism. I ought to ask you to enlighten me in Emerson's

dark sayings. But they do not trouble me. I have read him so

much that I skim or slide easily over hard things.

  My physical health seems perfect. Some effects of the blow

do not leave me. The periods between extreme suffering are less

frequent--wider apart--but not less painful.  A  Christmas

without Lucy!  On the day of her death six months ago!  We

are in bondage to mental habits; [to] the recurrence of dates. In

each month certain days bring the past freshly before me. I

fancy I shall be free from these frequent reminders after a year

passes. There is a feeling of loyalty to her which seems to com-

pel me to indulge mournful thoughts. Do not mistake. Relief

is coming.  I am more like myself--more hopeful. . . .

                        Very sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- What essay next? With some hesitation I venture to

suggest: Let us begin with the first of the volume "Poetry and

Imagination." It contains less that is on the deep questions

 than some others. But I do want you to read extensively Emer-

son's writings. Their tone, spirit, essence are full of the savor

of salvation. Besides this essay has its full share of passages,

mysterious and dim.--H.

   MRS. HARRIET C. HERRON,

     Cincinnati.



   December 28.  Saturday. -- Read Emerson.  Received a letter

 from Major Hosea excusing me from a speech, if I would attend

the banquet of the Loyal Legion. This makes me happy. For

the first time, I may enjoy the occasion without the alloy of a

task--of a speech.

   My favorite prose authors are for the most part American,

Emerson, Hawthorne, Lincoln, Webster. These I read most. I

have read of poetry chiefly, Shakespeare, Byron, Scott, and, lately,

Arnold (Edwin), and Browning.



Private.

         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 28, 1889.

  MY DEAR SENATOR: -- The Clyde matter I cannot speak of off-

hand. Will inquire. Captain Cleary, the writer of the letter, is

a good Republican soldier -- reliable.

  My suggestion for the medical board for pensions is, John B.

Rice and William Caldwell, Republicans, and Frederick S.

Hilbish, Democrat; all physicians of the best class in this town;

all soldiers of the war. This suggestion is approved by our Mem-

ber of the House, Colonel Haynes. By the way, I know Colonel

Haynes well from his youth up. A decided partisan Democrat,

he is trustworthy and judicious.  I hope you will be on the best

footing with each other. He will do to tie to.

  Please tell your clerk to send me two copies of Chief Justice

Fuller's address, also a copy of the memorial volume on Hen-

dricks, Vice-President.     Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    United States Senate.









             <B>COLONEL HAYNES COMMENDED          535</B>



  January 1, 1890. -- The New Year opens with one of the worst

possible winter days.

  The young people went to Toledo to hear Joe Jefferson. Laura

[Mitchell, who came last Saturday] and I spent the day with

reading the letters of Lucy--chiefly those written during the

time she was at home during the (to her) terrible days of the

war. Every horror of the awful time struck sledge-hammer

blows on her very heart.

  I made four calls--on Mrs. Dorr, the Keelers, Mrs. Bristol,

and Mrs. Miller. This was in the rain late in the afternoon.

In the evening read to Laura the gossippy book of M. B. Field

on authors, public men, and the like.

  January 2. -- The working hours of the day with Laura over-

hauling letters of Lucy.

  January 3. Friday. -- The whole forenoon given to my

correspondents.  Wrote in reply to editor of the Century a note

(not to be published) in favor of civil service reform, with my

message to the Senate on the New York custom house and my

note to General Merritt when he was confirmed as collector.



  Scott left in the evening to go to Cornell, settle up his matters

there, and return early next week to prepare for business life. I

hope he will be industrious.

  January 5.  Sunday.--Heard a good old-fashioned sermon by

Presiding Elder Barnes. He gave as precedents the case of

Abraham about to slay Isaac, the Hebrew youths, Meshach,

Shadrach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace, and the miracles

connected with Moses. It sounded strange in view of more

recent thought as to these oriental accounts of the Hebrew

fathers.

  We read also "A Hazard of New Fortunes" by Howells. It

promises well.

  January 6. Monday. -- To Toledo. Found Mary and Sher-

man very well. A most agreeable afternoon and evening with

them and Birchard. A happy family.









<B>536          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  January 7. Tuesday. -- Went about 11 A. M. to the D. H. &

M. en route for Cincinnati. Met Waggoner who presented the

case of the people against the Natural Gas Company (presumably

the Standard Oil); a vigorous old man who hunts down a

question with thoroughness.

  Read in Belford's Magazine Jeff Davis on Andersonville and

his autobiography. It is well to hear both sides. There is an-

other side but in any event bad enough.

  Mrs. Brice, wife of the leading Democratic candidate for

Senator, got on the cars at [for] Lima. We had interesting talk

for two hours until we reached Lima. She told me the details

of the failure of J. O. Moss--a miserable business.  Let me

bear in mind Mrs. Moss and visit her in Sandusky. She made

Mrs. Hayes very happy in New York by her kind hospitality

last spring. Lucy's last visit to New York was perhaps her best.

Mrs. Brice expressed a desire to have a fine portrait of Mrs.

Hayes; thought I would like to send one to Mrs. Cleveland also.

  Reached Burnet House before 6 P. M., and, after supper, a

pleasant call at Harriet's [Mrs. Herron's].

  January 8. Wednesday. -- After many days of rain, clear in

Cincinnati. Called on Captain Hunter on [Loyal] Legion matters.

At Aunty Davis' found no one at home.  Spent the next few

hours with Mrs. Herron and dined there.

  In the evening at the new rooms of the Legion we had our

new yearly ladies' day and a frugal luncheon. The principal

speeches were by A. F. Perry and General J. Warren Keifer.

General Keifer spoke of the Shenandoah Valley in the war.

His two star points were the announcement to the army by

brave old General----of the proclamation of Lincoln abolish-

ing slavery on January 1, 1863--well told--and the victory of

Opequon, September 19, 1864, with my crossing of the slough

as the salient point. The cheering as the point was reached was

very hearty and I was, of course, much gratified and very grate-

ful to General Keifer.

  January 9, 1890.--Cincinnati, my old home, is very pleasant

to me--full of sweet recollections of Lucy and others. A mix-









             <B>DEVOTION TO CINCINNATI          537</B>



ture of tender and sad with joyful. I told the president of the old

Literary Club that no one part of my education was so useful to

me as the years from 1849 to 1860 in the club; and no honor

more gratifying than to be chosen captain of the club military

company -- the Burnet Rifles -- in May 1861.

  Visited, with Aunty Davis, Mrs. Bullock, Mrs. Wilber (gave

them each a portrait), Lucy's teacher in the old Wesleyan Fe-

male College, and called at the Cincinnati Woman's College and

on Mrs. Murray Shipley. Then the rest of the afternoon with

Mrs. Herron.

  January 10.  Friday.--With Aunty Davis to Delaware.  A

happy ride talking over early life -- our early life in Cincinnati.

  Mrs. Davis left the train at Delaware. I dined in the dining-

car. Met there Major (?) Guthrie, a Cincinnati member of the

Legion, and an agreeable ride to Cleveland. Drove to Aunty

Austin's. Found that Mrs. Austin was gone to New Jersey.

Miss Avery gave me a hearty kind welcome and [I] spent the

evening and night pleasantly. Webb came to tea. Slightly

stricken, both Miss Avery and Webb, with the wonderful pre-

vailing epidemic, grippe.

  January  11.  Saturday.--Drove  with  Webb  to Lakeview

Cemetery to look at monuments. None exactly to my wish, but

the following were nearest to my views. . . .

  January 14. -- Last evening urgent letters from General Hast-

ings and Emily to visit Bermuda. Can I do it? I will today

accept the invitation to attend [at Philadelphia] the twenty-fifth

anniversary of the Loyal Legion--April 15.  I find that is

Tuesday. The steamer leaves New York Thursday, 17th; due at

Bermuda April 20; and returning leaves Bermuda Thursday

May 1, giving me eleven days in Bermuda.

  Finished reading Howells' last novel, "Hazard of New For-

tunes."  It has a purpose.  It shows the inherent defect, the

fatal weakness, of our present social system--a system that

fosters the giant evils of great riches and hopeless poverty.

Crime, vice, wretchedness are the sure results of this system.









<B>538          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  January 16.  Wednesday.--I wrote to the President last eve-

ning a personal letter in behalf of General Mitchell as pension

agent at Columbus. This on the advice of Sherman.

  Governor Campbell's inaugural on the penal, reformatory,

and benevolent institutions, and touching education and the sol-

diers is very good. He seems to have the sense to know that a

man must see something besides party in his public utterances.

  I must write a short address on the aims of the Loyal Legion.

What are they?

  1. To promote and preserve the friendships of the war--its

comradeship. This is its social feature.

  2. To collect and to perpetuate in permanent form the his-

tory, biography, and literature of the war. This is its historical

aim and feature.

  3. To maintain and strengthen the principles and purposes for

which the war was waged by the loyal Union soldiers, viz., union,

liberty, the national authority, supremacy, and sovereignty.

  4. To secure as far as we may the well-being and good name

while they live and the everlasting fame and memory after death

of all who faithfully served the good cause in civil life, at home

or abroad, or in the ranks of war, on sea or land, from the hum-

blest sentinels who stood guard around our loyal camps to the

grand victor at Appomattox, and the great Commander-in-Chief

at the head of the column, whose great service and sublime

martyrdom made immortal the name and career of Abraham

Lincoln.





         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 15, 1890.

  MY DEAR SENATOR: -- I am obliged for your letter as to the

pension agency, and have written to the President in substance

that this is the one appointment in which I am personally inter-

ested. I am greatly in hope that it will turn out as I wish

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.









             <B>AIMS OF THE LOYAL LEGION          539</B>



          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 15, 1890.

  MY DEAR SIR:--It is a gratification to say that all of the

paragraphs in your excellent inaugural on topics in which I am

specially interested are of such a character that I thank you and

congratulate you.

  Do not feel called on to reply.

                        Very sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GOVERNOR JAMES E. CAMPBELL,

    Columbus.



  January 16. Thursday.--In the evening with Rutherford,

Scott, and Fanny attended an agreeable small tea party of Mr.

and Mrs. Bristol. With the gentlemen discussed the great prob-

lems, spirit and matter, immortality, the soul, and the great ques-

tion of "nihilism," as I call all opposition to plutocracy.

  January 18. Saturday.--[At Cleveland yesterday and last

night.] Called on Mr. John C. Covert at the Leader office.

Found him much interested in the negroes.  Told him of the

Mohonk Conference in June and promised him an invitation from

Mr. Albert K. Smiley to attend it.

  Called during the day on Captain Kendall of the Legion. Sug-

gested strongly the danger of one black ball in all cases of civilian

candidates.

  The meeting of the committee on the Garfield memorial ser-

vice took place in the afternoon at Mr. J. H. Wade's office.

Present, Amos Townsend, chairman, J. H. Rhodes, secretary, Mr.

J. D. Parsons, General James Barnett, and myself.

  We decided to dedicate the Garfield Memorial May 30, 1890.

Simple ceremonies -- Cox to deliver the address. General Bar-

nett, marshal, General Myer, his chief of staff. I am to preside.

I must write to General Cox. Also to General Devens and to

Sherman.  The two last for the programs of [the dedication of]

Bunker Hill and Washington Monuments.

  Delighted to find Laura here after her jaunt to Columbus.

        In the evening I aura read third part of the autobio-

graphical sketches of Joseph Jefferson. Very good.









<B>540          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  January 19.  Sunday.--With Laura attended church.  Mr.

Mills' short and emphatic sermon was to the point that all our

actions should be for the glory of God. Too much of the doc-

trine, "I am willing to be damned for all eternity for the glory

of God," for my unorthodox soul.

  January 21.  Tuesday. -- Seven months ago today ! Laura is

writing lovely sketches of "Aunt Lu" for her [Lucy's] only

grandson, Sherman Otis Hayes. I do hope the dear boy will live

to enjoy reading them. What a grandmother he has lost he can

never fully realize, but these sketches will come nearer than any-

thing else telling her story.

  January 25. -- I cannot help recurring to the blow, the sor-

row -- now accompanied with many very tender and pleasant

recollections -- of this day seven months ago!

  Laura has been with us almost the whole month. She leaves

this morning. She has been to us all a comfort and an inspira-

tion. She writes for little Sherman and addressed to him,

beautiful sketches of his grandmother. We shall prize them all

so much.

  January 28. Tuesday. -- At 10:30 took train to Chicago from

Toledo. Dined at Elkhart. Met on the train General M. S. Has-

call who lives at Goshen, Indiana, with his handsome young wife.

He spoke warmly of the Hayes Administration and of his staunch

support of it. Was in the same class at West Point with Stan-

ley, Crook, and Sheridan. Stanley far superior intellectually to

either of them; Crook and Sheridan at the foot of the class.

Sheridan was suspended for fighting the sergeant of another

class who had reported him. Was whipped easily by the ser-

geant!

  Spoke of Shiloh. When his boat, crowded with his command,

a part of Buell's army, [came alongshore], the fugitives at the

landing at Pittsburg crowded on so as to prevent for a time Has-

call's men from landing. Then [they] went out to the second

day's battle. His idea was that the first day was a complete de-

feat of Grant and Sherman.

  Reached Chicago about 7 P. M. Met at the office of the









             <B>PROPOSED MEMORIAL OF MRS. HAYES          541</B>



Grand Pacific young Drake and a Cincinnati acquaintance of the

Burnet House.

  January 29. Wednesday. Chicago.--Last evening met Wil-

liam Henry and Mrs. Smith with their son. . . . Mr. Leiter

came and sat with us--an intelligent and entertaining gentle-

man, now with a home in Washington.

  After a short time we, Smith and I, went to my rooms and

talked over old matters until late.  We settled for the present

the biography [of Lucy] as follows: -- Smith will edit a sketch to

be made up from newspaper articles, letters, addresses, and

sketches,--a selection from  a collection of all that has been

written and said about her.  Laura and I will gather, and Smith

will use and arrange. This to be done, if practicable, next sum-

mer.  He is particularly anxious also to make a full and correct

record of our side of the 1876 conflict.  He says the Democracy

have had a too exclusive showing of their side of late.  He spoke

of the sharp thing which squelched a motion or suggestion of

Cummings, of New York (?), to put a statue of Tilden in the

Capitol with an inscription to the effect, "Nineteenth President

elect, but not inaugurated."  Some Western Member inquired:

"Would the gentleman have the inscription in cypher?"  That

settled it.

  No capitalists after any war were ever so well paid for money

loaned to the nation that carried it on. No class of money-makers

ever gained such prosperity by any other war, as our War for

the Union brought to the money-getters of America. All this

was due in a great measure to the rank and file of the Union

army. Now let no rich man haggle with a needy veteran of

that war about his right to a pension!

  January 30.  Thursday.  Chicago.--At breakfast with Wil-

liam Henry Smith and his promising son, Delavan, at 7 A. M.

  Then to the Lake Shore depot and en route home. Soon found

Fuller, the nephew of Mr. and Mrs. [S. F.] White.  He was

called from his home at D---- by a dispatch, that his uncle,

Mr. White, was down with paralysis!  Mr. White is the leading

business man of the town. He is engaged in a host of enter-









<B>542          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



prises and concerns, large and small. No wonder he breaks

down!

  January 31. Friday. -- Called at Mr. White's. His nephew,

Fred Fuller, is with him. He is conscious--not fully aware of

his condition. His mind runs on his business constantly. From

all I hear from Dr. Hilbish and others, I do not think he will

ever again be in a condition to take charge of his affairs.

  In the evening heard Colonel Sanford, of Iowa, lecture in our

beautiful little church to a crowded assembly.      He  called it

"Old Times and New." A humorous account of what he had

seen in extensive travels. The Chinese wall was his wonder of

the world. . . . On  the whole  a successful lecture; too

much humor, too little solid talk. But with a vein of human

sympathy, and of the duty to be happy and to make others happy

running through it which lifted it above adverse criticism.

  February 2, 1890. Sunday.--With Delavan Smith, of Chi-

cago, son of my friend William Henry Smith, [who came last

night] talked over the field of politics. The burning question of

the near future--wealth and poverty--how to limit them

He seems to see all that is now in sight on the subject.

  He gave me the pleasant talk of Mr. Pruden, an executive clerk

under several Administrations, about the business habits and

friendly characteristics of those he knew. He spoke of Hayes

as "the best business worker and of his family as the best he had

known."

  February 3. Monday.--Letters written as usual. The "Life

of Lincoln," by Hay and Nicolay, finished. The closing pages are

worthy of the subject.

  The death of Mr. White is a more serious calamity to the com-

munity and to individuals than was at first realized. He was the

leader in all enterprises. His interest in the property of the town

was so large and so diversified that all benefits to the town helped

him. He was an excellent organizer. All new movements for the

public welfare waited for him.

   He aided a host of those who needed help.  He took security

 for all loans. The methods he adopted often left his beneficia-









             <B>DEATH OF S. F. WHITE          543</B>



ries wholly dependent on him. Now that he is gone, they are

fearful of the result! This part of his work was of doubtful

utility. But it seems to deepen the sense of the greatness of his

loss.

  February 4.  Tuesday. -- The horror of the time is the burn-

ing of the residence in Washington of the Secretary of the Navy,

Mr. Tracy, with his wife and daughter and perhaps himself!

  In the afternoon attended the funeral of Mr. White at the

Presbyterian church. Mr. Barnes preached--no, he made a

suitable address. Mr. White objected to a funeral sermon over

his coffin. I was one of the pall-bearers. The others were near

friends of Mr. White in business.

  The church was crowded -- perhaps the largest congregation

ever in the church. At Uncle Birchard's funeral the cold weather

prevented many  from coming--the  sick, feeble, aged,--al-

though the attendance was great.

  Mr. Barnes quoted from Mr. White his reasons for feeling

himself unfitted for the ministry.  It was not very clear.  I re-

call Mr. White saying he lacked the emotional and sympathetic

nature required for success as a clergyman. He was right. Prob-

ably no one ever saw him shed a tear. His eyes never moistened

at others' woes nor at his own.

  February 5.  Wednesday.--Spent the day with Fred Fuller

and Mrs. White looking after the estate and will of Mr. White.

He left his property to his wife.  The witnesses to the will are

Kridler and Haynes. Haynes is a member of the House in

Washington, but will come when wanted to prove the will.

  There is a codicil with witnesses -- Wagner, now in California,

and Crum, deceased. This will take time to get Wagner's tes-

timony.

  Of course Mrs. White must now make a will.  On this she

consults me.  Probably she thinks as the money was made in

Fremont a part of the estate should go to the town. She asks

me, For what purpose? In what form?  I will tell her today to

leave to trustees for an industrial school enough to put it on a

safe foundation, seventy-five to one hundred thousand dollars.









<B>544          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  To Birchard Library two thousand five hundred dollars;

enough for a portrait of Mr. White and an alcove or collection of

books to be selected by his executors.



Confidential.

                SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, February 5, 1890.

  MY DEAR SENATOR:--My information from Clyde is that

there is no general preference for any lady, nor any special claim.

  Captain Charles L. Dirlam, a gallant soldier in General Buck-

land's Seventy-second Regiment, is a Republican of good repute

--fit for the place, and generally acceptable.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



  February 6. Thursday. -- Must wind up if possible Mrs.

White's will. Mrs. White having expressed a strong and appar-

ently final purpose to leave a considerable part of her estate for

the benefit of the town of Fremont, and having requested me to

aid her in selecting the special object to which her bequest should

be devoted, I took the matter under careful consideration. Parks

and library were provided for. She said: "The money having

been made in Fremont, I want Fremont to have the benefit of it."

After sleeping on it and recalling what Mr. White had done--

his offering a resolution in a public meeting endorsing my speech

in behalf of industrial education, and recommending the proper

authorities to introduce it in Fremont, -- I decided to recommend

her to devote what was intended for Fremont to the establishment

and support of an industrial school, to be known as the S. F.

White Industrial School. Accordingly I presented the matter to

her fully. She was at once greatly pleased with the idea, and

adopted it warmly, saying, among other things, that if the con-

dition of the estate would warrant it, she would gladly begin the

work in her lifetime so she could enjoy seeing the good it would

do. She gave to Home and Foreign Missions of her church ten

thousand dollars [and] seven thousand five hundred dollars [re-

spectively]; [to] aged ministers, seven thousand five hundred









             <B>DISPOSITION OF WHITE ESTATE          545</B>



dollars, to the church in Fremont two thousand five hundred

dollars, and to Birchard Library one thousand dollars.

  The only part of the will I decidedly dissented from, and so

told her, was the bequest of too small a part of the estate to

Fred Fuller and his sister. They had been regarded by Mr. and

Mrs. White as their adopted children--being in fact nephew

and niece of Mrs. White; the public had so thought, and the

young people had grown up with this notion. They ought to

have had a much larger provision by the will. But Mrs. White

was resolute. She "did not believe in giving young people too

much."

  February 7. Friday.--Preparing a little fifteen-minute talk

for Lincoln's birthday. Reading also Mark Twain's "Yankee

at the Court of King Arthur."

  February 8.  Saturday.--Reached Aunty Austin's  [Cleve-

land] at 3:30 P. M.  All out.  Went to the tombstone man, Ca-

rabelli.  I like his design.  Massive, plain.  Will take it home

to show to the family.

  February 9.  Sunday.--At Cleveland.  Spent the day very

delightfully at home reading Mrs. H. B. Stowe's "Life" by her

son, Whittier's "Snow-Bound," etc. Must get Mrs. Stowe's

"Life," and read again "Snow-Bound."

  February  10.    Monday.--Visited  in  the  morning  both

Newton M. Anderson, the excellent teacher of the Normal Train-

ing School, and Mr. John C. Covert, of the Leader.  With Mr.

Anderson went over the whole subject of an industrial school in

Fremont. If Mrs. White retains her purpose to begin at once

a training-school, it can be done on a small scale for two thou-

sand five hundred dollars for equipment of tables and tools, five

hundred dollars for power -- and two thousand dollars for teach-

ers the first year. Am encouraged to urge it. With Covert talked

over the Negro Conference at Mohonk. Will write Mr. Smiley

as to further invitations.

  At 3:50 with Aunty Austin home on the Lake Shore. An

agreeable ride, with lovely winter weather.

   35









<B>546          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  February 12. Wednesday.--White's estate is more compli-

cated than I supposed it would be.  It also seems not unlikely

that it will be less in value than was expected. Brinkerhoff and

Mrs. White administer under the will.

  In the evening I spoke offhand thirty minutes at the opera

house to a very large audience on Lincoln.  The Sons of Veterans

have named it "Union Defender's Day" and propose to observe

the birthday of Lincoln hereafter. My speech was fair--I think,

scattered.

  February  14.  Friday.--Finished  reading  Mark  Twain's

"Yankee at the Court of King Arthur."  Instructive; not equal

to "Prince and Pauper." Sound on the question of wealth and

poverty. No rule, just and wise, except the rule of the whole

people. Our danger is the rule of the few wealthy. These are

the serious points of the book.

  February 15.  Saturday.--The feeling grows that the White

estate will not be large. So goes, if this is correct, my plan to

give Fremont an industrial school out of it.

  February 16.  Sunday. -- At church today a prosy sermon

left me free to put into words thoughts we must all have if we

think at all on what we see around us. Abolish plutocracy if you

would abolish poverty. As millionaires increase, pauperism

grows. The more millionaires, the more paupers.

  February 18. Tuesday.--Reached Columbus and warmly

welcomed by Laura about 4 P. M. . . . Called on Captain

Cope before dinner, and was posted up in the business of the

meeting of the university board.

  February 19. -- Board met about 10 A. M.  Agreed on all rou-

tine matters rapidly. A Colonel Williams with a committee of citi-

zens presented their real estate project, viz., an extension of Neil

Avenue through the university grounds.

  February  20.  Thursday. -- Elected Lieutenant Ogle, son-in-

law of my old friend, Dr. Godfrey, of Ottawa, military instructor.

Afternoon, visited the university.  Much and favorably impressed

with the improvements.









             <B>MITCHELL FOR PENSION AGENT          547</B>



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 20, 1890.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am surprised by your letter. Of course

the charge that Mitchell is not a good Republican is trivial. It is

the resort of an adversary, hard up for something to allege

against him. I know about his Republican record. It is as good

as that of any man not prominent as an office-holder or office-

seeker. He is supported by the best Republican soldiers in the

State.

  As to the other more serious charge of questionable railroad

transactions, I can say that I never heard of it before, and I do

not believe it has any foundation. He suffered losses in a railroad

affair many years ago by the rascality of another, but this is the

first time he has been charged with it in that connection so far

as I know or believe. May I ask who makes the charge? And

specifically, What is it? Mitchell is now in bed very sick with

erysipelas--too sick to be talked with on the subject. I hear

from the best citizens, well informed on the subject, that no one

they can think of would object to General Mitchell on the ground

referred to except in the interest of some rival applicant. If

I believed the suggestion I would instantly relieve the case by

withdrawing.  Please let me hear fully and have action delayed

until General Mitchell is well enough for me to draw his attention

to the case. Can you do so?

                         Confidentially,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S.--I return home immediately. General Mitchell is too

unwell to be talked to on the subject. Please write me at Fre-

mont. -- H.

  SENATOR SHERMAN.





  February 24. Monday. -- Signed almost two hundred di-

plomas Loyal Legion. Wrote to Governor Campbell as to the

Garfield dedication May 30. To Cope, offering to resign to give

                                SPIEGEL, February 24, 1890.

  MY DEAR MRS. HERRON:--Your letter gives me joy.  I find

each of the passages you note marked by me. The trouble, as you

say, is that so many are fine, sensible, wise, that one must call

attention to almost all. I do not see that laughter is to go out

entirely. Perhaps it is because there is a smack of barbarism

--of "Choctaw" -- not yet worked out of me. Christ is not

recorded to have ever laughed. Possibly we have read the pro-

hibition as more complete than Emerson meant it to be. On

page 96 he says: "Beware of jokes; too much temperance cannot

be used; inestimable for sauce but corrupting for food." He

hates screaming laughter--"contemptible squeals of joy," and

who does not? But, with you, I deem Chesterfield as an ex-

ample or authority out of place on a page of Emerson.

  It is needless to add to your catalogue of diamonds. But I

will give part of my list: On the first page of the essay (page

79): "Grace is more beautiful than beauty."  On page 88-9, be-

ginning "a few times in my life it has happened to me to meet

persons of so good a nature. . . . --persons who could not be

shocked." Here is a page that is all golden, page 90: "It is

very certain that sincere and happy conversation doubles our

powers," etc. [Page] 91: "Woman if not the queen and victor

is the lawgiver," and on for quantity. [Page] 97: "In good con-

versation parties don't speak to the words but to the meanings

of each other." Page 100: "But nature is not poorer today."

Then for a page he describes "an American to be proud of."  He

has in mind a rich man of Boston, Mr. John M. Forbes. I know

him. He is a sterling and interesting and effective character. A

shockingly diseased feature disturbs you (his nose) at first, but

you soon forget to notice it in the good sense, good feeling, and

power of the man. But enough of this. The essay is so good I

wish I knew it also by heart. -- Next?

  Evidently I brought away the volume I meant to leave with

you, and left you a volume I intended to keep. You should have

the volume entitled "Nature, Addresses and Lectures."         Let

Will get it and have it charged to me at Robert Clarke's. That

volume contains the sermons and addresses which show why he









             <B>WISDOM OF EMERSON          549</B>



left the pulpit. Suppose we take that volume next beginning

with "Nature."

  Yes, indeed, Nellie<B>*</B> will be missed by you. The honor and

recognition of the judge will amply pay the young people [and]

must be gratifying to you and John. -- But for you! -- Such is

this "spere of existence," as Nasby says.

  Nothing new with us. . . .  I have decided to make  a

short trip to Bermuda from April 16 to May 1. Fanny will

probably go with me.

                 With all regard. Sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. H. C. HERRON.



         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, February 24, 1890.

  MY DEAR GOVERNOR:--The memorial structure to President

Garfield in Lake View Cemetery at Cleveland will be dedicated

on Memorial Day, May 30. Governor Cox will deliver the ad-

dress. A formal invitation will be sent to you by the proper

committee, and suitable arrangements made for the entertainment

of yourself and your party. The occasion will be notable and

your presence is specially desired by all concerned. I now write

you that you may not make other engagements.

  The assemblage will be large and will, of course, expect that

President Harrison and yourself be presented, and to hear you

at such length as you may deem suitable.

  All this I intended to say when I called on you last week. I

send you a little pamphlet which will give you some information

about the memorial structure.

                       Very sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GOVERNOR JAMES E. CAMPBELL,

    Columbus.



  February 25. Tuesday. -- Lucy left us eight months ago this

morning. -- Wrote to Mrs. Herron. In the afternoon attended

rison had shortly before appointed Solicitor of the Treasury.</FONT>

the funeral of my old friend for forty-five years -- the Lutheran

minister, Rev. Henry Lang D. D. He began his ministry here

in  1843.  A  great  audience.  More  weeping  than  I have

noticed at any funeral. Fanny and I listened to the German and

English sermons--both too long.  The sketch of his life and

deeds was short and well done.

  February 26.  Wednesday.--I am asked by a committee of

schoolgirls in Olive Furnace, Lawrence County, Ohio, to rebuke

a namesake, who in a school children's vote was opposed to local-

option prohibition. I reply:--

  "Please say to my namesake: 'Always try to have the cour-

age of your convictions, and vote as your judgment and conscience

dictate.'

  "On the question of temperance, remember that the only rule

which is absolutely safe is total abstinence.  Self-control is 'the

higher law.' "

  Read one hundred pages of Mrs. Stowe's "Life" by her son.

Genuis, goodness, sympathy in the midst of sickness and poverty,

and yet with much happiness.

  Must get "[The] Minister's Wooing" and "Uncle Tom" in

good print and binding. Among Lucy's favorite books are two

fine copies of "Old Town Folks."

  February 27.  Thursday. -- Have been reading in Leader and

Herald an article by John C. Kimball on the "Ancient Lowly," a

book by C. Osborn Ward, showing the condition of laborers in

Greece and Rome -- their unions, rebellions, and gain by Chris-

tianity. The progress of society is mainly--is, in its proper

sense, the improvement in the condition of the workingmen of

the world.

  March  1,  1890.  Saturday.--Reading  Ward's  "Ancient

Lowly," a fascinating book. How to pronounce Aryan? The

race corresponding to Caucasian--the descendants of Japhet.

The Indo-European, a language including Greek, Latin, Teutonic,

Celt; opposed to Semitic (Jews and Phoenicians).

  We have got rid of the fetish of the divine right of kings,

and that slavery is of divine origin and authority. But the di-

vine right of property has taken its place. The tendency plainly









             <B>"DIVINE RIGHT OF PROPERTY"          551</B>



is towards a government the exact opposite of the popular

government for which Lincoln lived and died--"a government

of the people, by the people, and for the people"--and instead

of it to set up "a government of the rich, by the rich, and for

the rich."

  In the evening attended the lodge (I. O. O. F.). As usual,

Ben Cornelius raised a rumpus with the Chair (Noble Grand),

who was often in the wrong on appeals and the like, but I took

the side of the under dog in the fight and voted consistently, right

or wrong, like a good partisan, to sustain the Noble Grand.





                                     SPIEGEL, March 1, 1890.

  MY DEAR AUNTIE DAVIS:--March is coming in like a lion.

The truth you sadly recall, "so many of our contemporaries have

passed away," seems wonderfully true in our narrow home circle

in Fremont -- Mr. White, Rev. Lang, Mrs. Downs, Mrs. Stil-

well, Mrs. Brush -- all very near to Lucy -- gone recently. Sadder

yet, Carrie Little -- Lucy's nearest friend in early schoolgirl

years, and very dear to her always -- has not gone, but, stricken

with paralysis, lingers in great suffering, vainly seeking rest by

a journey to California! Showing us how death itself may be

a consolation and a blessing!

  We are moving on as smoothly as possible. The boys are all

good and kind -- a great comfort. Fanny is lovely and lovable.

But the vacancy! It does not grow less!

  As to the publication of your address and such additions as

you choose to make--the "In Memoriam" of the Missionary

Society -- I have all the time preferred that it should be done, if

the society wish.  The more formal biography to be sold with a

view to profit has not struck me favorably. I will return your

address, etc., and shall be more than glad to see them in print;

will contribute to that end if need be.

  My best wishes to the doctor.

                        Very sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S.-- I do not object, of course, to the sale of your "In

Memoriam." -- H.

  MRS. ELIZA G. DAVIS,

    Cincinnati.



  March 2, 1890.  Sunday.--Church with Fanny A. M.  P.M.

reading a novel by Miss Barr, "Remember the Alamo." Chiefly

attractive from its associations. With my chum, Guy M. Bryan,

of Texas, in 1838-42 all this interesting field of the pioneer his-

tory of Texas was often gone over. In 1848-9 I visited Bryan

at his home in Brazoria County, and with him and Uncle Birch-

ard on horseback travelled over southern and southwestern

Texas. We spent several days in San Antonio when it was all

alive with California adventurers from all the South, and was as

gay and full of variety of peoples and attractions as it was in

any of the scenes described by Miss Barr in the novel.

  March 4. Tuesday. -- Thirteen years ago the inauguration.

Lucy in the Senate Chamber -- Diplomatic Gallery -- with her

angel face looking down on the scene as the notables gathered to

swear in the Vice-President before proceeding to the east front

of the Capitol. What a picture she and her dear ones! Read

Mrs. Clemmer's description of it all.--The public inauguration

here referred to was on Monday, March 5, 1877.

  About I I A. M. on time, took train to Cleveland; arrived

at Aunty Austin's an hour or two after train arrived by reason

of falling in with Comrade James Hayr, Twenty-third. Went

to the studio of the artist of the groups for the soldiers' monu-

ment in the Public Square. A wonderful negro artilleryman and

a gigantic female figure for the summit of the monument.

  March 5.  Wednesday.--Meeting of board of Western Re-

serve trustees. A trouble on hand with the Medical Department.

Appointed chairman of committee--Mr. L. E-- and Mr. Per-

kins--to confer with medical board.

  In evening attended the medical commencement with Mr. H--.

Went over his new hotel, the Hollenden. He complimented my

Administration; clean, honest, pure.









             <B>FUNERAL OF PENDLETON          553</B>



  March 6.  Thursday. -- Met the doctors.  An agreeable meet-

ing; rather good disposition manifested; put off final action until

the June meeting.

  Afternoon, attended the funeral of Edwin Cowles, the owner

of the Leader--born in 1825. A man of pluck and force. Not

always wise, but his influence good.

  March 7.  Friday. -- Reached Cincinnati to attend funeral of

Mr. [George H.] Pendleton on urgent invitation of Mayor

Mostry about 11 P. M.

  March 10. Monday.--At Columbus in Laura's pleasant

home. Saturday attended obsequies of Mr. Pendleton in Christ

Church, Cincinnati, and at the Music Hall--with a great au-

dience in Music Hall. Mr. I. M. Jordan made a very fine ad-

dress, eulogistic of Mr. Pendleton. He argued fully his Civil Ser-

vice Bill as the great act of his life.

  On train to Columbus with General Hall, a soldier of Maine

now  at Columbus.     Reached  here after 9 P. M.       General

Mitchell much better. Laura dear (the darling!) [suffering],

with rheumatism.

  Sunday talked over the general's case for pension agent. The

papers got up here completely answer the charges made against

the general.  They are from the men who know the facts -- men

of character and reputation.



Private.

     SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, March 10 [11], 1890.

  MY DEAR SENATOR:--I send you papers herewith which com-

pletely answer the charges against General Mitchell. They do

prove a negative in his behalf.

  They are from men who know the facts personally -- men of

high character, widely known, and who enjoy the confidence of

all who know them. The paper referred to I mark Number 1.

I am personally acquainted with three of the gentlemen who

sign it. They are among the best citizens of Columbus, and

speak from the inside. Mr. Jones, the late Democratic postmas-

ter, I do not know, but he is a man of good repute.









<B>554          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  On the general situation, Judge Stewart is the Republican

circuit judge, a citizen of Columbus. His letter is Number 2.

  Judge Pugh is the Republican common pleas judge in the sub-

division of Franklin, Pickaway, and Madison. Elected in a

strongly Democratic district by reason of his firmness and in-

tegrity in prosecuting the election frauds of 1885 in his county

of Franklin. I mark his letter Number 3.

  General Beatty knows the situation well. You know him. I

mark his letter Number 4.

  Mr. Jones, late postmaster, knows all about the affairs of the

company referred to, and I mark his letter Number 5.

  General Beatty and I will go on General Mitchell's bond with

other good men. If a list of names are [is] needed, I can fur-

nish you with three-fourths of the Columbus directory.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    Washington.





  March 13.  Thursday. -- In the evening [yesterday]  attended

the revival meeting in our church of Rev. Yatman. The best

and most enjoyable I ever attended. A company of forty or

more converts from the Lima revival came down. He called out a

lawyer, a banker, an oil operator, a travelling [man], and a

county official. Each spoke a few (usually) discreet words on

their joy in a Christian life. The party were excellent singers.

Some delightful and tender hymns were sung. When the bene-

diction had been pronounced the preacher said: "Now, before

you leave shake hands with at least ten persons." I began and

soon the Lima young folks all came and shook hands with me;

also a host of others.

  Evening at G. A. R. and later looked in on the church crowded

with "the male persuasion" only! -- Maria Herron, a fine girl,

[here for a few days]. I have enjoyed her visit specially.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, March 14, 1890.

  During the Antietam campaign I served in the same corps

with Colonel Cutts, and have sufficient information of his ser-

vice throughout the war to be well assured that it was of de-

cided merit.  I am confident that he deserves the relief that Con-

gress is asked to afford, and I sincerely trust it will be granted.

            SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, March 15, 1890.

  DEAR SIR:--I have no recollection of the facts spread before

me in the case of Captain C. H. Campbell in 1881.

  Assuming, however, that the facts are correctly stated in the

letter of General H. I. Hunt, a copy of which is before me, dated

"Soldiers' Home, Washington, D. C., June 14, 1888," I am satis-

fied that such relief as can now be granted without injustice to

others would be altogether proper and that I concur with the

opinion on the case expressed by General Hunt.

                           Sincerely,

  GENERAL CHARLES E. HOOKER,           RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

    Washington, D. C.



             SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, March 15, 1890.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your note of the 13th is before me.  I merely

meant by marking my letter "Private" that it was for you per-

sonally, but not for the files. I am entirely willing it should be

shown to the President, and all of my letters on the subject. I

would only add that the letter on the loan association signed by

five gentlemen, is from the board of directors of the company--

three of whom I know well to be of integrity and intelligence

of the most trustworthy sort, and all of whom I believe to be so.

Fairly considered, it is a complete refutation of the rumor in

reference to the matter.  The case seems to me ample, but if not

I can reenforce it to any extent.  With thanks.

                        Very sincerely,

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.              RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.









<B>556          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  March  15.  Saturday.--Attended  the funeral  of our  old

friend Theodore Clapp. An able man, a constant reader in his

rheumatic suffering, opposed strongly to orthodoxy, a spiritualist.

His death announced without black lines of mourning: "Passed

to the spirit life" in his seventy-second year. Mr. Barnes, the

Presbyterian clergyman, officiated in his usual felicitous way.

  March 16.  Sunday. -- Read Lowell's "Commemoration Ode,"

the parable of Christ's return to earth, and "Democracy" (prose).

Lowell's ode in honor of the returning Union soldiers of Har-

vard is, I suspect, the greatest American poem.

  March 18.  Tuesday. -- Began to read [Charles] Dudley War-

ner's fine new novel, "A Little Journey in the World." Sensible,

sound, and charming. Curiously enough, it adds another to the

list of "nihilistic" novels--to the "Hazard of New Fortunes,"

by Howells, "A Yankee at King Arthur's Court," by Mark Twain,

etc., etc. Of course, I mean no disparagement by the word "ni-

hilistic." I use it to mean all opinions tending to show the wrong

and evils of the money-piling tendency of our country, which is

changing laws, government, and morals and giving all power to

the rich and bringing in pauperism and its attendant crimes and

wretchedness like a flood. Lincoln was for a government of the

people. The new tendency is "a government of the rich, by the

rich, and for the rich." The man who sees this and is opposed

to it, I call a "nihilist."

  March 19, 1890. -- Attended funeral of Blackburn, comrade of

G. A. R., who died at his post of heart disease.  Watchman at

our railroad crossing as we go to town. "Faithful found," "died

at his post," said Father Manning.  I marched in the snow with

the comrades from the hall to his dwelling and back to the church

by the side of a tall negro -- the comrade who bears the colors.

  Read Dudley Warner's fine new novel to the end. Some good

epigrammatic and other sentences.



                                    SPIEGEL, March 20, 1890.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--All of our family anniversaries come to me

now with a tinge of sadness. We have not forgotten yours.  I









             <B>DEATH OF GENERAL CROOK          557</B>



tried to think of something to get and send you, but I failed to hit

upon the book or the article. So be good and get yourself some-

thing or other worth twenty or twenty-five dollars and look at

it and enjoy it as a gift from your lonely, sorrow-stricken father.

Pardon this. I will be cheerful when I meet you.

  Be good--conscientiously good.       Do  not let your bachelor

ways crystallize so that you can't soften them away when you

come to have a wife and family of your own.

  With all good wishes.

                        Affectionately,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

    Cleveland.



  March 21.  Friday.-- Nine months ago today!

  I have just heard (12:30 P. M.) of the death at Chicago of

my dear friend and best beloved commander, General George

Crook. I have no particulars. When I visited my friend Wil-

liam Henry Smith, at Chicago, in the winter, I saw much of

General Crook and was much with him. He did not seem to be

in good health. But he was so hardy and strong, so full of cour-

age and spirit, that it made no impression on me. How the sol-

diers loved him!  The Thirty-sixth Ohio! the Army of West

Virginia! -- indeed, all who knew him well! Without pretension,

plain, simple, warm-hearted, kind. Fond of the young. Faithful

in his friendship; appreciating the volunteer soldier; with an

Indian's patience, endurance, and sagacity. Believed in by the

Indians--they trusted him.

  Webb came this evening and will go with me to Chicago. I

am requested to act as pall-bearer. Funeral 1:30 P. M., Sunday.

Interment at Oakland, Maryland.

  March  22.  Saturday.--Webb  goes  with me  to Chicago.

Maria Herron, after a pleasant visit, for me specially, goes home

to Cincinnati, leaving here on same train.

  March 24. Monday. 7 P. M. -- Just returned from the fu-

neral of my beloved commander, George Crook, at Chicago. Beau-









<B>558          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tiful and appreciative discourses by Rev. [David] Swing, and

Rev. [Simon J.] McPherson, and impressive and tender cere-

monies.

  General Crook was written to by his brother, elected captain

of his company, to know how he could learn to command it well.

The reply was an apothegm--a gem:--"Learn to command

yourself and you will find no trouble in commanding your com-

pany."

  March 25. Tuesday. -- Nine months ago this morning! Her

picture by Sarony is such a satisfaction. I send this morning one

to Mrs. Crook at Oakland.

  Dr. Holmes says he has lived to see come in to help our civil-

ization:--1. Railroads,  2. Ocean steamers,  3. Photography,

4. Spectroscope, 5. Telegraph, 6. Telephone, 7. Phonograph,

8. Electric light,  9. Electric motor,   10. Anaesthetics.  Also,

sewing machines, mowers and reapers, bicycle.

  Engaged on correspondence. Signed three hundred and five

diplomas of Loyal Legion, and called on Janette [Keeler] to see

our Fitch cousins, "Minnie" and "Bob," the children of mis-

sionaries to China, now going to the university at Wooster.

  March 26.  Wednesday. -- This morning, in addition to nec-

essary correspondence, I have finished my short speech for the

Loyal Legion celebration of their twenty-fifth anniversary at

Philadelphia. It is ready for the printer.

  This afternoon I have begun to put in a scrap-book all I find

in the newspapers about General Crook. He was my nearest and

best friend of all [the] commanders under whom I have served

in the field. A man of wonderful character and gifts. No

seeker after popularity, he was loved by all sorts and conditions

of men. Sherman says, you could rely on him. Even the savages

believed in him. With all of the essential and usual virtues of

the soldier, he had modesty, sincerity, tenderness, absolute in-

tegrity, and veracity. With all of these qualities he was shrewd,

cunning, and could "keek through every other man," as Burns

says, "with sharpened, sly inspection." He wears the double

wreath--the soldier's and the humanitarian's.       A  Wellington

and a Howard united in one head and heart.









             <B>GENERAL CROOK'S CHARACTER          559</B>



  In the volume containing Mr. Evarts' address and the pro-

ceedings at the dedication of the Seward Monument, at Au-

burn, New York, a letter of Leonard Swett is given in which he

says Mr. Seward said, "he was not fairly dealt by in not being

permitted to die with Lincoln"! His work was done and he was

entitled to be discharged with his chief.

  March 27.  Thursday. --  Correspondence.   Reading up the

congressional proceedings, etc., in the last two weeks. The Blair

Bill [for National aid to education] lost by bad management.

My friend Thomas Tooker made paymaster-general in the navy.

Captain Reed, postmaster at Fairmont.

  The Administration does not make appointments hastily. Great

care taken by President. Not always happy in the way of doing

it. A lack of tact, perhaps, but conscientious and judicious.

  March 28. Friday. -- Evening read the [Crook] funeral talks

of Rev. Dr. Swing and Rev. Dr. McPherson at Chicago. Very

fitting and beautiful. Also read Emerson's "History." Many ob-

scure passages; good, notwithstanding.

  March 29.  Saturday.--This morning wrote to one of the

sons of Cousin Charlotte DeWitt the following:--

                                  FREMONT, March 29, 1890.

  MY DEAR COUSIN:--I have your letter of the 23rd as to "a

position in the New York office or in Washington."

  Those places are under the civil service law, which is now, I

believe, strictly enforced. Mere "influence" is of no avail. The

places are not made vacant to afford room for anybody, and are

filled when vacancies occur upon competitive examinations ac-

cording to merit. But in addition, if I may venture to advise

you, you are better off, more independent, and with a better out-

look anywhere in private business than in the government ser-

vice. I am out of the range of information as to the details of

the situation in private employment, but I give you the same ad-

vice I have given to my own sons and which all four of them

are acting upon. None of them have ever sought places in the

public service and are all earning their living in ordinary business

pursuits. Please think of my notions. They are the result of a









<B>560          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



pretty wide observation, with good opportunity to reach a cor-

rect conclusion.

                        Very sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  When I was in Washington I often heard of my "amiable ob-

stinacy." I now find in Emerson's "Self-Reliance" the phrase,

"good-humored inflexibility."

  March 30.  Sunday.--Webb came last evening on his return

from Chicago after his journey with the body of General Crook

to the place of interment at Oakland in Maryland. The place

he reports as very forlorn, but the accessories were agreeable

and Mrs. Crook behaved admirably. It now seems almost certain

that the final resting-place of the general's remains will be at

Arlington.

  When Crook was promoted from lieutenant-colonel to briga-

dier-general in the regular army, he was in the mountains of Ari-

zona, fighting Apaches. He did not return and hear the news

until long after it was known to his wife and friends at head-

quarters.  When she and others told him and congratulated him,

he said: "I can't feel glad to get promotion by the death of so

good a friend and so good a man as General Canby."  After-

wards when he was made major-general, perhaps ten or twelve

years afterwards, he said: "This comes as a matter of course, and

I enjoy it more than I did my appointment as brigadier-general,

for that came by the death of General Canby, one of the best of

men."

  March 31, 1890.--Our young cousins from China, Robert and

Minnie Fitch, have come to America to be educated at Wooster

for missionaries. Their parents are now in that work in China.

These are third cousins. My best reflection is that a life spent in

duty must be well spent. Whose sense of duty is to determine?

Live according to your own conscience.

  April 1, 1890.  Tuesday.--Laura, darling, born forty-eight

years ago this day! Another anniversary observed by a letter,

or somehow, almost fifty years. This is the first for almost forty

years without Lucy! Will write to Laura at once. . . .









             <B>GENERAL CROOK'S CHARACTER          561</B>



  Called with Fanny on the Bristols. Mr. Bristol has just re-

turned from Florida. . . . He does not blame people for being

Democrats in the South. Otherwise they are on a level with the

degraded negroes! A shallow view of duty, but it is so natural

that it must be considered.

  April 3. Thursday. -- I read with much satisfaction in the

Toledo Commercial that General Mitchell was yesterday nomi-

nated for pension agent at Columbus. A long and awkward con-

test, but "all's well that ends well."

  April 5.  Cleveland, 891 Prospect Street.--After breakfast

called on Honorable Amos Townsend, now the active man as sec-

retary of the Garfield Memorial Association. He seems to have

the affair well in hand. . . .  In the afternoon Mr. Townsend

called with a carriage, with Colonel McAllister and General

Myer, and we drove to the monument to select the [site for the]

placing of the stand.

  Major Bottsford called here and remained to dinner. He gave

me a paper written from Crook's dictation by Kennon on the

battles in the Valley.

  April 6.  At church with Fanny--Easter Sunday.

  Called on General Buckland to congratulate him on "Shiloh

Day." "Twenty-eight years ago at about this hour we were in

very bad shape; things looked squally for us." He is much broken

and tremulous but his intellect is sound and clear, and his spirit

and courage perfect. His good conduct on that critical day is

now a joy to him and fills his declining years with honor.

  Lieutenant Kennon and I went over my old diaries and papers

of the war. He is likely to be the biographer of Crook and will,

I think, do his work well.

  In the evening I finished the novel on the "Penal Colonies of

Great Britain"--a powerful book.

  April 8, 1890. -- Correspondence. Begin to prepare for ab-

sence from home for three or four weeks.

  General Mitchell confirmed. All comments seem to be friendly.

His splendid military record is given in full.

<B>562          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 8, 1890.

  MY DEAR SENATOR:--I am very much gratified by the ap-

pointment and confirmation of General Mitchell. You have done,

I know, all you could properly, and I thank you for it.

  I feel like thanking the President also, but hardly know whether

it is the thing to do. He has done it as a duty not as a favor, etc.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- I go to Philadelphia for the 15th and 16th; thence to

Bermuda with Fanny for two weeks and return. -- H.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.





  April 9.  Wednesday.--This is the wedding day of Mary

Bristol to Meade G. Thraves.  We are more intimate with the

Bristols than with any other family here. Mrs. Bristol was the

support and comfort of Lucy, especially in all of her home mis-

sion work.  Her friends upon whom she leaned were Mrs. Bris-

tol, Mrs. Miller (Aunt Nancy), Mrs. Dorr, and, last but not

least, Lucy Keeler, "our dear cousin."  Near to Fanny also--in-

deed to us all.



  Private.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 9, 1890.

  DEAR SIR AND COMRADE:--Your second letter is before me.

Your first letter was a good one. Your second is hasty and bad-

tempered. You go off at a half-cock.

  What you want is natural, and for all that I know, proper.

You use hard words. Did you ever know men of your name to

yield to abuse?

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  BRICE HAYS,

    Columbus.









             <B>GENERAL MITCHELL CONFIRMED          563</B>



Private.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 10, 1890.

  SIR:--It is represented that in a recent number of the Spring-

field Republican you tried to give circulation to a malicious fling

at me, which is untrue in all its parts. You attribute it to Emory

Storrs, now deceased. You also connect with it the name of Mrs.

Hayes, who died recently.

  If this is true, you will, on reflection, think as I do, that it was

neither decent nor manly.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE PATRICK A. COLLINS,

    Boston.



Private.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 10, 1890.

  Leaving home tomorrow to be absent a month, I find in my

mail this morning an unsigned letter with a printed caption as

per the address of this. It puts a question which is in fact no

question at all.

  Nineteen-twentieths of the successful business men of Cleve-

land have got on very well without a college education. Such an

education is not "necessary" for a business man. It may in some

cases be practicable and advisable.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  [Copy unaddressed.]



  April 13, 1890. . . . Read about Shakespeare's play of

"Cymbeline." The origin of the Hayes family given. Imogene,

the finest of the women of Shakespeare, is nearer my darling

Lucy than any other character in fiction or history. With beauty

and position, she is unspoiled and--well, the ideal woman.

  Philadelphia, April 14. -- Reached Pittsburgh [Fanny and I]

about 8 A. M. -- Our Chicago friends were ahead of us and left

Pittsburgh just before we entered the depot!  We were invited

into the car of the Michigan Commandery and wore their badge.









<B>564           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



An agreeable party. General Witherington, of the Seventeenth

Michigan Infantry, and many other friends, ladies, married and

young, made it an entertaining trip.

  Met at Philadelphia about 7 P. M. by General Merrill and

others of the committee. Reached our comfortable quarters at

the Aldine promptly. There met Corbin and Kate.

  April 15.  Tuesday.--The Commandery-in-Chief met at the

Historical Library. A happy meeting and greeting! We decided

that under the amended constitution all of the young fellows,

members by inheritance, were, in badge, etc., etc., second class.

Webb and Rutherford thoughtlessly grumbled. It hurt me aw-

fully  . . . and spoiled the next few hours for me.  My

hard-headed boys, to act so!
