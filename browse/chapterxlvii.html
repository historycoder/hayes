  NOVEMBER 6. Tuesday, 7 A. M.--Cloudy and just begin-

    ning to rain. This on election day encourages the Demo-

crats and depresses the Republicans. I think there is nothing in

it. The party which is best satisfied with its ticket, platform,

and the general situation, is likely to have the most zeal and

activity. The contest seems doubtful, but with the chances in

favor of our side.

  I leave today to go to Cincinnati to attend the meeting of the

Loyal Legion. The returns will come to me there.

  Charlotte DeWitt came yesterday morning.  She has been a

widow more than six years. Is of course lonely, but much in-

terested in her four boys. I will leave her here. We talked

over old times and early friends, now gone, until we were in a

melting mood. Lucy writes in rather a despondent tone. Meet-

ing and friends agreeable, but she longs for home again.

 November 9.  Friday. -- Went to Cincinnati via Toledo after

voting at 9 A. M. Rain fell during the day beginning early.

Called a Democratic day for election. I protested that the Re-

publicans were quite as energetic as their opponents, and that

the weather would not hurt.  It so turned out.  I read the "Life

of Lincoln" by Stoddard on the cars. Rode in a coupe to my

                         <B>(420)</B>









             <B>ELECTION OF HARRISON          421</B>



friend's home, Dr. Davis'. Mrs. Davis absent in Boston with

Lucy attending the Woman's Home Missionary Society meeting.

The local indications of the election favorable. After tea went

to Herron's.  Met Mrs. Herron, Maria, Lucy Hayes Herron,

looking sweet and lovely as a picture. Mr. Holmes came in.

After a time he and Maria went out to see the excited throngs

gathered about the places where the returns were displayed.

  After chatting an hour longer with Harriet, I left and went

 to the office of the Commercial-Gazette.  Met there Halstead

and Boynton, both hopeful; and the returns seemed to lean our

way. Thence to the Lincoln Club. Admitted by strangers with-

out a ticket on giving my name.  With many friends, Mayor

Smith, Mack, Noyes, etc., etc., gossipped over the returns. A

mass outside, anxious but hopeful, waiting for definite results.

It became noised outside among the multitude that I was inside.

Calls began--they grew more frequent.  The notion, I suspect,

prevailed that I hesitated to show myself until a certainty was

reached. At any rate, when I appeared finally at the window,

my appearance was hailed with a shout from the "sea of up-

turned faces" that was indeed the shout of victory.  I never

before saw or heard anything like it.

  I soon went home to Dr. Davis', well satisfied that the result

was with us. Before going I spoke to the members on the in-

troduction of Governor Noyes in their assembly as follows: "I

am rejoiced to meet you. I am grateful for your hearty greeting.

I agree with you in--all things."

  Awake at early daylight, I listened anxiously to hear the cries

of the newsboys. I soon recognized, "All about the election of

General Harrison."  I rose hastily and went out in the rain.

Soon got a Post and [an] Enquirer which confirmed the news-

boy's cry.  I returned in a grateful frame of mind.  "How good,

how good!" I murmured to myself. Such is government under

our system. The best and decentest election I ever knew. I re-

call distinctly, boy and man, elections for more than fifty years

--from 1836 when I was a schoolboy at Norwalk Seminary.

With a good deal of respect for Cleveland and with sympathy

for his young wife, I cannot but specially rejoice that such good

people as General and Mrs. Harrison are to carry their clean









<B>422          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ways and pure lives into the White House. Besides, I do hate

Cleveland's course towards the veterans of [the] war.

  November 10. Saturday.--Lucy returned last evening with

Mrs. Bristol. She had altogether a successful meeting of the so-

ciety over which she presided. Was disappointed in not seeing

General Devens, Mr. Winthrop, and Mrs. Homans. She was

delighted with Governor and Mrs. Claflin, Edward Everett Hale,

and Mr. Twombly with his lovely flowers.

  November 11.  Sunday.--Webb came last evening.  His first

visit since his annual Rocky Mountain hunt, and since the elec-

tion. He is browned by exposure, healthy and strong. Very

happy over the election. Especially so, as his friend Burton

pulled through for Congress.

  The hunt was very successful; five grizzly bears, a goodly

number of elk, black-tailed deer, and antelope.

  About eleven last night a party of young people with George

Buckland as leader, about fourteen in all, with brooms came

singing and hurrahing, "What is the matter with Hayes?" "He's

all right"; Harrison ditto, Sherman ditto, etc., etc.  They re-

mained and sang war songs for half an hour. All lively and

pleasant.



                               SPIEGEL, November 12, 1888.

  MY DEAR GUY:--Glad to hear you are "still on deck" in your

old home -- your new home and with all of your neighbors.

  I am just going away for a few days and have only time to

respond, in the same spirit with you, to all advice leading to

peace, harmony, and new and better things.

  This feeling is general--almost universal here.  Read the

New York World [and] two articles in the Cincinnati Com-

mercial-Gazette -- of late a very radical paper.  (I only find the

less significant one of the Cincinnati Commercial-Gazette.)  But

you will see the sentiment. Let us hope, and do what we can in

this beneficent work.

                          Sincerely,

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,            RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

    Texas.









             <B>HONOR TO WARDEN McCLAUGHRY          423</B>



  November 13.  Tuesday.--I go tomorrow to Upper San-

dusky where in the afternoon I will speak to the Findlay Con-

ference in behalf of industrial education.

  My Twenty-third Regiment comrades have induced me to go

to Ashland, where the band and Company G were raised, to

speak at the dedication of a soldiers' monument.

  November 17. Saturday. -- Wednesday I went to Upper San-

dusky; the guest of Mr. Harris, banker, an intelligent and

wealthy bachelor. Addressed a crowded churchful at the con-

ference of the Findlay District. Rev. A. C. Barnes, presiding

elder.  In the evening with Mr. Johnson, of Marion, to Marion.

There a few hours at the hotel of Richardson and wife. A good

time on Brattleboro, etc. Then at 2 A. M. to Ashland. At the

Miller Hotel. Mrs. Mary F. Freer gave the soldiers a monument.

Reverends Pepper and S- made rattling speeches. I spoke

acceptably. A good solid speech by Commander O'Neal.

  November 21. Wednesday. Columbus.-Came Monday. With

General Mitchell. Laura gone East. Wrote to Sherman for

Mitchell.

  Tuesday with Ohio State University board. At evening at-

tended reception of President Scott. Talked with Professors Eg-

gers, Derby, Lord,, Knight, Townsend, O'Bannon(?) and wife,

the Virginians, and Kellicott.  Fine intelligent men. . . .

Tonight to Chicago.

  November 24. Saturday. -- Returned from Chicago this morn-

ing. Reached Chicago from Columbus on the Panhandle route.

Warden Coffin and daughter were on the train. Talked of

prisons, indeterminate sentence, parole system, etc. At Chicago

met Rev. Wines, Nicholson, of Detroit, Felton (Charles), Cas-

sidy, [of] Philadelphia, and others.

  Dined at Chicago Club with Colonel Corbin. At table were

Senator Farwell, General Crook, Mr. S. B. Barker, Robert Lin-

coln, J. Mason Loomis, General Robert Williams, General E. S.

Dalton. Met at the club Marshall Field, Pullman, Colonel Fred

Grant.

  In the evening addressed a large meeting entirely offhand,

but on familiar topics connected with prison reform. Was hand-









<B>424          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



somely greeted and much applause was constant as I clinched

my points.

  [On the] 23rd, with Mr. Wines, the prison officers took the

cars to Joliet.  They were met by Major McClaughry and went

to the great prison. Assembled in the parlor, I acting as spokes-

man, they presented to the major a beautiful album, made for

the purpose [filled with] autograph letters and photographs of

the wardens, with those of Mr. Wines and myself. Dined, vis-

ited the prison, and about 5:30 P. M. returned to Chicago. On

the whole a very gratifying trip.

  November 25. Sunday. -- Heard the temperance evangelist,

Dr. Tracy, morning in Methodist Episcopal church and evening

in Presbyterian. Good audiences. A liberal and sympathetic

presentation of the subject. "I will arise and go to my Father,"

the text of the principal discourse. He spoke of "prodigals"

and "magdalens" as reclaimable only by a union of human sym-

pathy with the grace of God.

  November  27.  Tuesday.-- Very  anxious about our  dear

grandson Rutherford at Toledo.  Very sick since 3 o'clock Sun-

day morning with "genuine croup." He is a bright, promising

little fellow, good-looking and good.

  Toledo.  P. M.-- I took the one o'clock train at Fremont.

Fanny came on same train from the East, returning from the

Kentucky wedding. I saw her a moment -- looking so happy and

lovely; told her I was going on account of the critical situation

of Rutherford.  She was shocked -- no time for words! . . .

As I approached it [the house] I looked for the crape at the

door and was hopeful, as I failed to see it, until I saw Lucy

standing at the door to receive me -- weeping! "He is very low

-- we have no hope." I went into the room. Mary was kneel-

ing over him.  He was breathing heavily. . . .  [Not long

after] all was over.  A  beautiful boy--gone forever!  Dear,

dear parents. So much affection gathered about him! Mary is

to me the perfection of womanhood. Takes the place of my

sister Fanny--the dear, dear memory of early life.

  November 29, 1888.  Thursday.--At Toledo, 9:30 A. M.,

Rev. Mr. Williamson, in Birchard's library, to an audience of









             <B>DEATH OF FIRST GRANDSON          425</B>



friends, read a chapter in the Bible and made a ten-minutes

touching and consoling talk. . . .  In a car furnished by the

railroad, a mournful Thanksgiving ride home.

  November 30.  Friday. -- At ten o'clock the friends filled the

large library, and in the small parlor were the little fellow and

the mourners. Mr. Williamson read from the Scriptures [and]

made a quiet talk--consolatory. Singing twice. We drove to

the cemetery and left him by the side of our last, little Manning

Force, under the beautiful white pine on my lot. . . .  Lucy

said: "I now feel better about our little Manning. He is no

longer alone!"

  December 1.  Saturday.--I have been getting many letters

asking me to recommend friends to General Harrison -- so many

that I must act on the only practicable and proper rule: Send

no recommendations unless General Harrison consults me.

  December 2. -- Walked with Fanny to church.  Dr. Tracy, the

temperance evangelist, preached. Too much stress on "mint,

anise, and cummin," and omitting the weightier matters; or

rather an example of

            "Compounding for the sins we are inclined to

             By damning those we have no mind to."



  He was severe--a chronic, a crank--against theatre-going,

card-playing, and dancing. Not five per cent of his audience

were addicted to either. But covetousness, avarice, envy, hatred

and malice, slander and scandal, stingy giving to the church, and

all uncharitableness, he let bravely alone. The sins of himself

and others before him--he never gave to them even "the cold

respect of a passing glance."

  In the evening at the Presbyterian church, he did far better.

His ranting is of the stage variety--stagy but effective.  How

to advance the temperance reform is the difficult question. The

tendency is to force, to law, to attack as the one solely responsible

the liquor seller. The mistake is constantly made of letting off

the liquor buyer as not in [any] sense a sharer in the guilt. The

liquor people take the opposite view. The man wants to buy.

That is his affair. "I may innocently sell if he can innocently









<B>426          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



buy," is the self-justification of the saloon-keeper. Neither is

right. We should punish buying "the soul-destroying dram."

Make it as disreputable in public opinion to buy and drink the

dram as it is to steal, and the traffic is substantially suppressed.

You can not eradicate the traffic by punishing one-half of it

and letting the other half go free.

  December 4.  Tuesday. -- Lucy returned last night.  The dear

sufferers at Toledo bear their loss with the best disposition.

  I wrote to Comrade Bickham that I was a G. A. R. man and

could not do anything  to the disadvantage of the G. A. R.  He

replies showing the merits of the controversy. He is a U. V. U.,

a Union Veterans' Union man. But there is a division and con-

troversy it seems. I reply as follows:--



                          FREMONT, OHIO, December 4, 1888.

  MY DEAR COMRADE:--I have no prejudice against any asso-

ciation of comrades of the war.  Certainly I prefer that all

should go together. I would prefer only one organization. But

different societies exist. I am ready to go, when I can do so,

wherever the comrades can for the time being unite. Your house,

if I read your letter aright, is divided on the proposed meeting.

I am sorry it is so, for it compels me to postpone my meeting

at Findlay. I was at the unveiling of your monument more than

thirteen years ago.

  With all good wishes.

                           Sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  COLONEL G. BICKHAM.

  December 5. -- The temperance revival goes on. It is said the

saloons will be closed hereafter Sunday.  So far, good.  Our

temperance work, as [it] is called, relies too much on the con-

stable. Law can not take the place of education, morality, and

religion.  Law is no substitute for character.  As long as men

want drink, they will get it. The young should think and feel

that buying is equally a crime with selling. We cannot safely

put the sin and condemnation wholly upon the saloon.









             <B>TRUE TEMPERANCE REFORM          427</B>



        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 7, 1888.

   MY DEAR SIR:--My friend Mr. Boalt has just told me of the

naming of your son after me in honor of the fact that he was

born on the day of my inauguration as President almost twelve

years ago.

  I send to my young namesake a photograph, and wish to ex-

press to you my appreciation of your kindness, with the wish

that the young fellow will be worthy of his parents and a credit

to the name he bears.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

   P. S.--If the lad will acknowledge the receipt of the photo-

graph, I will send him another, which is a curiosity. -- H.

   MR. JOHN IRONS.



  December 8.  Saturday.--Reached Oberlin about 2 P. M.

[yesterday]. Was met at the station by Mr. C. V. Spear and

taken to the residence of Hon. James Monroe, professor of his-

tory and political science. After dinner we visited the principal

buildings.  Among them a number recently built, of stone, which

are very creditable. Mr. Spear built the library and museum.

He is an enthusiastic supporter of the manual training move-

ment. A small affair not connected with the college but a be-

ginning.

  I met President Fairchild and other gentlemen of the faculty,

-- all cordial. In the evening a great crowd filled the large church

and galleries full to suffocation. I spoke [on manual training]

more than an hour.  Was well received and probably left a good

impression for the cause.

  December 9.  Sunday. -- Mr. Mills preached a temperance ser-

mon, so called. He read a list of texts apt as a condemnation of

the drink habit, etc., etc. But he failed to see that the man who

buys and drinks is the sinner.  The fashion of denouncing the

seller, and sympathizing with the drinker as the victim, the inno-

cent victim -- nay, the meritorious victim, has nothing to do with

the sin and crime. When in fact he has everything to do with it.









<B>428          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



No law which punishes the seller and lets the buyer go free

will ever succeed in the long run. It is partial and a compromise

of principle.

  The true principle is, prohibit the whole traffic and make it dis-

graceful.  Punish it as a sin and a crime.  The buyer in fact is

far more guilty than the seller. This is radical. Your attack on

the seller alone is a compromise.

  The foregoing is part of a talk with Dr. Tracy, of Bryan, Ohio,

a temperance lecturer, who has done well here during these last

three weeks. He agreed with most of it. Says he is by no means

a third-party man.





                                  SPIEGEL, December 9, 1888.

  MY DEAR WEBB: -- Very busy -- "cumbered with many things."

        [The] 17th I go to a meeting of the delegates to the New

York centennial of the Government in New York at Columbus;

also to Dr. Haygood's meeting of the Freedmen's Aid and South-

ern Education Society. Thence to organize at Indianapolis the

Indiana Commandery of the Loyal Legion. I must "hustle," you

see, and need the dry-goods you are getting. I wish I had a

FIRST-class soldier's soft hat. Never have had one since the war.

General Barnett usually excites my envy with his.

  Rededication of church next Sunday.        Guests -- hurry --

friends! etc., etc.

                             Ever,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

    Cleveland.

                        FREMONT, OHIO, December 11, 1888.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your very kind invitation of the 8th instant

for Mrs. Hayes and myself is before me.  I need not assure you

that it would give special pleasure to both Mrs. Hayes and my-

self to accept and be, while in your city, the guests of yourself

and Mrs. Martindale.  We have however a prior invitation from

the committee of the commandery about to be organized, and I

suppose my duty is therefore to go to the headquarters estab-

lished at the Bates House.









             <B>NEW CHURCH DEDICATED          429</B>



  It is not decided yet whether Mrs. Hayes can go. She enjoys

soldier occasions and would like to come, but her other engage-

ments and her growing aversion to travel and other circum-

stances are very likely to prevent her from attending.

  Please explain the situation to Mrs. Martindale. Our church,

burned last February, is to be rededicated next Sunday and Mrs.

Hayes finds her hands full and more. We buried here our old-

est grandson on the first of the month, and Mrs. Hayes is not

in a frame of mind suited to the occasion in your city. We are

greatly gratified by your courtesy and would under other cir-

cumstances gladly avail ourselves of the opportunity it offers.

  Please present our kindest regards to Mrs. Martindale and

your daughter.             Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  JUDGE E. B. MARTINDALE,

    Indianapolis.





  December 15.  Saturday. -- Rev. Dr. J. W. Hamilton, of Som-

erville, came with Rev. Mr. Wykes to take part in the dedi-

cation of our rebuilt church. The new structure is finer than the

old one and we have added a good parsonage. Our total debt

as yet unprovided for is in round numbers six thousand dollars.

We must raise three thousand dollars to clear the church; as

much more as we can on the parsonage.

  December 16.  Sunday. -- Hamilton preached a good sermon.

The day was rainy and discouraging. The pastor is a little too

self-conceited and talks too much.  Many do not want him

to succeed.  Hamilton was patient and persistent and finally

raised over two thousand three hundred dollars in the forenoon.

At the evening service, all was in better condition; better

weather, a larger and better-disposed audience. He raised the

subscription easily to three thousand five hundred dollars.

  December 17.  Monday.--At Columbus, attended in Wesley

Chapel the discussions and papers of the Freedmen's Aid Society.

  In the evening, I presided; made a short prefatory talk. As

chairman, introduced Rev. Dr. Haygood. He made a wonderful









<B>430          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



talk. It was humorous, pithy, pathetic, and convincing. Paid me

a high tribute for my course as President.

  December 18.  Tuesday. -- Talked with Gray on the selection

of president for Delaware. Dr. King, of New York, or Gobing,

of Kansas, the best man now before us.

  Met with commissioners of Ohio (at [the] governor's office) to

the centennial of the inauguration of Washington. Chief Justice

Owens, Herron, Herrick, Captain Bushnell, Firestone, and self.

I chosen president. Firestone, secretary. May have to go to

New York January 8.





                             COLUMBUS, December 18, 1888.

  MY DARLING: -- All goes well. Dr. Haygood made a wonder-

fully fine talk last [night]--nearly two hours, intensely interest-

ing.  He gave me the finest tribute I ever had -- "the final ver-

dict of history on my Administration."

  Laura will be home tonight. She staid over one steamer in

Bermuda.

  I go to Indianapolis this afternoon. Was appointed to go to

New York [the] 8th [of] January as commissioner of centennial.

Herron and the rest here. I made chairman as usual. I wish you

could always be with me. A host of people inquire for you in

earnest.

                          Ever your

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. HAYES,

    Fremont.



  December 21, 1888.--Tuesday evening, 18th, with General

Wright to Indianapolis. Met at Indianapolis by Major Calkins

and other Companions about 11:30 P. M. Taken to the New

Denison House. Met there Judge E. B. Martindale and Ruther-

ford. [The] 19th spent according to "the slate" [Loyal Legion].

Receptions and banquet. Called with others on General and Mrs.

Harrison. Both very cordial. Very. The general invited me to

call next day at 10 A. M. for "a full talk."









             <B>LOYAL LEGION AT INDIANAPOLIS          431</B>



                               SPIEGEL, December 21, 1888.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Your good letter I find very interesting. My

"prophetic soul" had already divined the situation you deplore.

Who can be wise and be an anxious seeker after the great office?

Try to smother your vexation and hold on. The chapter of acci-

dents may turn in our favor. When I read that a firm man, of

cool temperament, loses his head in such a race, it recalls with

some satisfaction my own experience twelve years ago.

  Let Mrs. Smith have a time in W          .  It is good every

way. Give her our very best wishes and believe me

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

    New York.



  December 23. Sunday. -- As the grandfather's clock in the

hall was slowly striking five P. M. in its clear tone, Rev. Dr. D.

D. Mather was going through the ceremony of baptism [of Sher-

man Otis Hayes] in the red parlor. Present all of the family

except Webb.

  December 30. -- Our wedding day. Thirty-six years ago we

married! Two years Birchard and Mary married. Both happy

occasions to be recalled.

  December 31.  Monday. -- Yesterday with Mary and Birchard

here and Scott, Rutherford, and Fanny, we spent our wedding

day very happily.

  In the evening the Presbyterians and their pastor were in-

vited to be the guests in our new Methodist Episcopal church.

Mr. Barnes preached one of his great sermons. The point urged

was, sin brings misery and failure, while righteousness makes for

happiness and success in this life and in the life to come.





                        FREMONT, OHIO, December 31, 1888.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- Recalling your interest in the details

of household affairs at Washington, I have suggested to my son









<B>432          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Webb, whose business takes him occasionally to your city, that

he call on you, as he is thoroughly posted on the whole matter --

much more so than I am.

  With all good wishes.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GENERAL BENJAMIN HARRISON,

    Indianapolis.

                       FREMONT, OHIO, December 31, 1888.

  MY  DEAR WEBB:--The Leader editorial is in good form.

General H- was not however "a charter member." Study

accuracy.

  This unsigned letter puzzles me. It is from a Herrick. But I

can't recall his initials.  Give them with comments.

  I hope you are coming tonight. Unless you care to see Gen-

eral H- specially, I would drop it. No harm either way. If

you wish will send you a note of introduction.

                          Sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

    Cleveland.



  January 1, 1889. Tuesday. -- Letters -- letters! More than

two hundred last month to be replied to.

  A pleasant day with Birchard and Mary. In the evening Scott

had a dancing party of his young friends (sixteen), a feast and

happy time. At 4:30 P. M. Lucy and I with Patterson and the

team took our pastor Mr. Mills out to Scott Township--ten

miles or more to a home mission meeting, in which Mrs. Inman,

Mrs. Gossard, and others led. A fine supper at Henry Ludwig's.

Promised their son, A. C. Ludwig, and daughter one each of

"Robinson Crusoe," "Swiss Family Robinson," "Little Lord

Fauntleroy," or "Prince and Pauper"; that is, I promised myself

 to give these presents. After supper we drove in the dark over

 to the church (Methodist Episcopal) south of Greensburg where

 an audience packed it full. They were having recitations, songs,

etc. Rev. Mr. Mills delivered an excellent home missions ad-









             <B>SLATER BOARD MEETING          433</B>



dress of thirty or forty minutes. After this I spoke with good

emphasis a few minutes. Altogether a successful meeting. Drove

home by eleven P. M. Found Scott's dancing party still on and

merry.

  January 2.  Wednesday. -- Learned at Greensburg of the new

gas well at Gibsonburg; could see its light six miles off north

from Mr. Ludwig's door. Said to be a three-million gusher.

  Governor Fish wrote well and with discrimination of Governor

Aiken: "The kind gentleness of his intercourse was an insep-

arable part of his nature, and the happiness of others was with

him an object of life, and formed a large part of his own happi-

ness. The pleasure of others was his enjoyment."

  Today our holiday children all leave us, Mary, Birchard, Sher-

man, Scott, and the nurse. Tomorrow I go with Fanny to New

York to attend a special meeting of the Slater board and a meet-

ing of the commissioners of States and the general committee

of the New York celebration of the centennial of the inauguration

of Washington.

  January 5, 1889.  Saturday. Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York.

--Our meeting of the Slater board was short but interesting.

I read a brief paper as to the death of Dr. Boyce which was

adopted as the sentiment of the board for record and transmis-

sion to the family.

  Bishop Henry C. Potter was chosen in place of Rev. Dr.

Phillips Brooks and Chief Justice Fuller in place of Chief Justice

Waite.  The secretary was directed to correspond with Professor

Broadus [of Louisville] as to taking the place of Rev. Dr.

Boyce. . . .

  January 6. Sunday.--Dined last evening with Mr. William

E. Dodge. Met Mrs. Dodge, Grace (Miss Dodge), Mr. and Mrs.

Russell, and Mr. C. L. Brace. A pleasant evening. Talk of re-

forms, politics, Bryce's new work, and Miss Grace was hearty

and interesting touching her democratic (in the best sense) and

charities work. She was much liked by Fanny as well as myself.

Received her book. Must cultivate her.

   28









<B>434          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Received invitations from Mrs. Reid, Mr. Jesup, and Mr. and

Mrs. H. C. Bowen. Today we dine with Mead.

  In the evening called on the Howells [family]. Mr. Howells

and Winifred ("Pillar")gone to a Russian family's Christmas.

A good talk with Elinor. She looks well and her conversation

was natural and like old times.

  January 7. Monday.--Governor Bullock called. Must try

to have a full talk with him.

  We called at General Sherman's. Did not get an interview with

him but had a friendly call with the girls and Mrs. Moulton.

  In the evening dined with Mr. and Mrs. Jesup and then with

them to the Trade Schools of Colonel R. T. Auchmuty uptown.

  January 9.  Wednesday. -- Yesterday called at the office of

the Independent.  Met Mr. Bowen, Mr. Ward, and the other

editors. Afternoon to the meeting of the Centennial Commission

in the City Hall. Met Mr. Clarence Bowen, "Commodore"

Gerry, Hamilton, et al.

  Evening dined with Mr. H. C. Bowen, 90 Willow Street,

Brooklyn. Mr. Storrs, Strauchan, and a host at the Tuesday

evening reading (Greek drama) and music. Back at midnight.

  There is one unquestioned way to close up the saloon. De-

stroy the demand for all intoxicating drink. This can only be

done by persuasion, by example, by public sentiment, and by indi-

vidual judgment and conscience.

  January 12, 1889.  Saturday.--With Fanny returned from

New York.

  Today found [a letter from] John Wood, of Philadelphia, sec-

retary of a Peace Arbitration Society. Wrote for him a letter

[to the] Emperor of Germany. "Thanks and congratulations"

on his peace address.

  January 13.--A happy day. Correspondence. Lucy read

aloud to the family "Little Lord Fauntleroy," or rather she read

selections from the book and read them beautifully. All of us

had read the book, of course.

  I read, or finished, Mr. Howells' last book, "Annie Kilburn."

It opens the democratic side of the coming questions. I do not









             <B>CENTENNIAL COMMISSION MEETING          435</B>



find a ready word for the doctrine of true equality of rights.

Its foes call it nihilism, communism, socialism, and the like.

 Howells would perhaps call it justice. It is the doctrine of the

Declaration of Independence, and of the Sermon on the Mount.

But what is a proper and favorable word or phrase to designate

it?

  January 14.  Monday. -- Wrote a host of letters today in re-

ply to patriots and friends anxious to serve their country.





                           FREMONT, OHIO, January 14, 1889.

   MY DEAR SIR:--I have the pleasure to inform you of your

election as a member of the board of trustees of the John F.

Slater Education Fund in the place of Chief Justice Waite, de-

ceased. By this mail I send you two pamphlets showing the na-

ture of the trust.

  Meetings are held annually, usually at New York.  Chief Jus-

tice Waite found it practicable to attend the meetings, and to

take an active interest in the work from the beginning, except

when absent by reason of sickness.

  It is the unanimous wish of the members of the board that

you accept the appointment.  If in doubt about it, please delay

your decision until President Gilman or Senator Colquitt can call

on you at Washington in regard to it.

  The next meeting will be in May 1889.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MELVILLE W. FULLER,

    CHIEF JUSTICE, Washington.





  January 20.  Sunday. -- Replied yesterday to about twenty-five

letters.

  A good sermon from Mr. Mills -- one of his best. He is carry-

ing on a series of meetings -- revival meetings.  Serious interest

manifested but no startling facts. He spoke of his own conver-

sion as occurring two years after he became a church member.









<B>436          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Read fifty pages in Bryce's "American Commonwealth." A

well-considered view of our institutions; nothing so far specially

salient.

  January 21.  Monday. -- Fanny at 7.30 A. M. via Fostoria to

Columbus, as the guest of our life-long friend Mrs. Belle Carter.

She was a popular, fashionable belle in her youth, forty years

ago, and has been a favorite lady in society ever since. She mar-

ried rather late Dr. Carter, a widower with grown daughters, and

while he lived was a beautiful example of a wife and stepmother.

Now, and for eight years past, a widow  of admirable life.

I am glad to have my daughter with so charming and capable a

mentor. She is fond of and attracts young people. She keeps

herself young and retains her fine manners and looks.

  January 22.  Tuesday. -- All sorts of droll requests reach me.

I have this morning a letter as follows, in a boyish handwrit-

ing:--

                                  PITTSFIELD, ILL., Dec. 28.

To the person to whom this letter is addressed:

  DEAR SIR, MADAM, ETC.:--I enclose you a portion of my auto-

graph book and would be very much obliged if you would sign

your name on one page and then addressing an envelope to the

next person after you on the opposite page, enclosing this letter

and the book. If you will, you will greatly oblige

                     Your obedient servant,

                                           OLIVER BARRETT.

  On the opposite page is written [with addresses]:--O. W.

Holmes, Oliver Optic, E. E. Hale, E. Eggleston, S. L. Clemens,

Charles Dudley Warner, Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, L. P.

Morton, Gen. W. T. Sherman, Rev. Mr. Howard Crosby, Rev.

Mr. T. DeWitt Talmage, George W. Curtis, Rev. Theo. Cuyler,

Mr. and Mrs. R. B. Hayes, Miss Frances E. Willard.

  The strange result makes it all interesting. All of the list have

responded to the lad's request favorably. Mark Twain grum-

bled of course in characteristic phrase, but General Sherman, O.

W. Holmes, and all came down handsomely; E. E. Hale and

Dudley Warner in the true spirit.









             <B>AUTOGRAPH SEEKING EXTRAORDINARY          437</B>



  Doctor Hale writes:--"I am glad to do what you wish";

and sends on with the note:--

  "DEAR EGGLESTON:--The above is forwarded by dear Doc-

tor Holmes to me.  I now forward to you.  Please pass it on,

till the trick shall come 'nigher-nigher.'"

  Edward Eggleston forwards with the words: -- "DEAR CLEM-

ENS:--Pass the thing along. I hope it'll get back to him safely.

-- E. EGGLESTON."

  Mark Twain signs "Truly yours," and on the envelope in pencil

writes:--"Pass the damned piece of impudence to Warner."

  Chas. Dudley Warner signs "Yours sincerely," and on the en-

velope:--"Passed on in an unruffled spirit to Mrs. Stowe.  C. D.

W."

  Mrs. Stowe passed it on to Levi P. Morton, writing:

  "DEAR SIR: -- Please pass this little boy's book along. -- H.

BEECHER STOWE."

  It was "passed by Mr. Morton to General Sherman"; by him

"to Rev. Mr. Talmage"; "by T. De W. Talmage to Rev. Dr.

Cuyler"; by Dr. Cuyler to George William Curtis, with the note:

"I hope you will add a name that all men honor"; by Mr. Cur-

tis to Dr. Crosby with the phrase, "I follow my leader"; and by

Dr. Crosby to me with the injunction, "Keep up the boy's ball."

We sign today "with best wishes" and send on, adding:

  "Passed by Mr. and Mrs. Hayes to Miss Frances E. Willard,

with kindest regards.

  "The good thing about this is that such busy persons as

have here given time to make a boy happy seem to have made

themselves happy in doing it. You will, I am sure go and do

likewise.--R. B. H."

  January 23, 1889. -- Letter writing. Received from President

elect Harrison a letter asking the name of a Southern-born man

in the Union army for Secretary of War. Replied: "Goff, of

West Virginia, or Goodloe, of Kentucky. Goff will probably be

cheated out of his governship before March 4. He is able,

agreeable, and true." His appointment will cover several points.

A protest again fraud in elections, etc., etc. Goodloe intelligent,

bold, and well equipped.









<B>438          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Received from Judge Martindale letter of Governor Morton,

published May 24, 1877, on President Hayes' Southern policy.

Will republish in the [Fremont] Journal.  Also a fine photo-

graph taken at Indianapolis December 19, 1888 and one by same

artist of General Harrison.

  January 24.  Thursday.--Replied to a happy letter from

Fanny, complimenting Mrs. Carter as mistress of "the most use-

ful of the useful arts and the finest of the fine arts--the art

peculiar to women -- the art of making homes happy."

  In the evening at the G. A. R.

  I received a letter from Colonel Crook. He says: "From all

that I can learn, your kind words in my behalf to General Har-

rison will be of great use to me." I hope this is so.

  January 25. Friday. -- I am getting many letters asking aid

to get appointments from General Harrison. I reply to one this

morning which shows the situation.



Private.

          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 25, 1889.

  MY DEAR COMRADE:--Your letter came duly, and I meant to

reply at once. But absence from home the greater part of the

time for six weeks past has postponed it. Indeed, I hoped to

meet you when East, the 8th of this month.  But briefly and

frankly I am committed for Gibson [for Commissioner of Pen-

sions].  He is my friend of forty years' standing.  We  are

neighbors. He is one of God's noblemen.

  Now this: After him, I am for you. But this must not hurt

him.  Your claims, I recognize fully.  I would like to see a man

who carried a musket for forty-three cents a day in that high

place. No man suffered or sacrificed more than you did. You

are honest, able, sympathetic, and "know how it is yourself."

Need I say more? If Gibson can't have it, I am for you.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  COMRADE JAMES TANNER.









             <B>CRITICISM OF BRYCE          439</B>



  The letters from all sorts of people who are anxious to serve

their country come swarming. I acknowledge most of them

briefly.



           SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 28, 1889.

  GENTLEMEN:--The completion of the new building of the

Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce is a notable event. The whole

people of Cincinnati are to be congratulated on their merchants'

new home. It commands the admiration of all who see it. Cin-

cinnati is fortunate. Her list of objects of interest and admirable

structures is by no means a short one. But the new monument

to the great promoter of modern civilization -- this monument to

commerce -- will long stand, if not at the head, at least very high

in the list.

   I regret extremely that I cannot be present at the dedication

of the building.           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.



          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 29, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I agree with you that it is very desirable that

the Commissioner of Education should be a man of mark and of

liberal views. Mr. Butler, it strikes me, would be altogether a

fit appointment. The office is one of the attractive places. Geog-

raphy and other considerations will have weight. It may be eas-

ier to get the post for a Chicago man than for a New Yorker.

You see the point. A list from different parts of the country may

be well. But, in short, substantially I am with you and will

aid.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MR. CHARLES H. HAM.



  January 31, 1889. -- Am still reading Bryce's "American Com-

monwealth." Bryce is evidently warped by his free trade and

other English prejudices in favor of the Democratic opinions of

political events.  For example, he says that Cleveland gained by

his numerous vetoes. In fact they gave offense to the soldiers









<B>440          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and their friends, and contributed largely to his defeat in the elec-

tion. He says the general opinion is now that the Electoral Com-

mission erred in their decision of the questions which determined

the result of the election of 1876. This is a decided mistake.

The general judgment is that they decided rightly. Indeed, few

people would now hold otherwise. Its guiding principle is that

the States decide all questions as to their vote at the election.

The decision of the proper State authorities must stand as to the

vote of the State.

  My wish for old age--its first symptoms now appearing:

              "A quiet nook, and a pleasant book,

               When the toils of the day are done."

  February 2.  Saturday. - I get daily letters asking aid to get

appointments from the President. Many are from old friends,

army comrades, and who are known to me to be fit to fill the

places they want. This much I can with some labor do and say,

viz., state their qualifications and merits, and commend them to

the favorable attention of the powers that be. But they want

more in many instances. They say: "You can secure this for me

if you will request President Harrison to make the appointment."

A gentleman appointed by me ten or twelve years ago consul in

Nova Scotia wants me to do this for him. He is almost a total

stranger to me. But I am sure he is a good officer, and that he

may properly be retained. He has written in a petulant way,

complaining that I do not urge his appointment, etc., etc. I

reply as follows:-

                          FREMONT, OHIO, February 2, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have your letter of the 29th ultimo. I want

to aid you, as far as I properly can, believing you to be a meri-

torious officer.

  I am asked by a host of others to request the President to ap-

point them. They say, as you do, without a moment's thought:

"This you can easily secure me."  Many of those who ask this

are old friends, army comrades, and persons known to me to be

worthy. To grant their demand would be to treat with disrespect

the President, and to put myself in the absurd attitude of assum-

ing the appointing power of the Executive!









             <B>IMPORTUNATE OFFICE-SEEKING          441</B>



  All I do is to give a testimonial as to the fitness of the appli-

cant, and to recommend his appointment.

  When you make up your papers, if you will send me one, I

will endorse it favorably, and return it to you for presentation

at the proper time to the proper Department, or if you prefer,

to the President.

  I return the papers as requested.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GEORGE C. TANNER.

  February 3, 1889. Sunday. - A full church.  Six new mem-

bers joined on probation -five men, one woman; well dressed,

good-looking young folks; twenty to thirty, all of them. Mr. and

Mrs. Dudrow, fine young people, dined with us, and our cousin

Lucy Keeler. An interesting afternoon.

  In the evening Webb came, en route home from a business trip

to St. Paul, Chicago, and Toledo. He met at St. Paul our friends

Governor Ramsay and Governor Sibley. General Sibley failing

with age. He recalled Mrs. Hayes saying, ten years ago when

the ladies were losing hats and locks of artificial hair in a wild

prairie wind on Red River: "Well, if my hair does fly so as to

make a Potawatomie of me, there is no danger of my losing it!"

  Governor Ramsay says: "The President mustn't be too un-

willing to consult Senators.  He can keep his independence, but

he must not seem to snub his associates in the Government."

  At Chicago he [Webb] saw much of Crook, and the friends.

General Crook thinks Sheridan's best work was in the final Ap-

pomattox campaign. "The Sheridan Valley campaign was not,

if closely scanned, the great work of Sheridan." No doubt Crook

himself gave the points - the flank attacks- which won Ope-

quon and Fisher's Hill.

  Is my friend on his staff addicted to gaming? He spends

freely. Too freely? is the question.

  February 4. Monday.--Charles L Webster, the publisher

of the books of General Grant, Sheridan, and McClellan, was on

the train with Webb on his western tour.  He gave interesting









<B>442          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



particulars of his experiences with the generals and with the

Pope.

  February 5.  Tuesday. - Mr. William O. Stoddard is writing

for the "Lives of the Presidents" my biography. I have this

morning writen to him this letter:--

                           FREMONT, OHIO, February 5, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR: - The message of Governor Hill has started

again the discussion as to what is to become of ex-Presidents.

Would it not be well, if you have not [done so], to give a chap-

ter to that topic? Governor Hill suggests life Senatorships for

the ex-Presidents.  This, as I see it, is wholly inadmissible.  The

Senate is already burdened with the great inequality between

such States as Delaware, Florida, Nevada, on the one side, and

New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, on the other. Besides there

is a new peril. The Senate is becoming the rich man's place.

Now, add to this life members, and you have a condition so in-

consistent with the principles of popular government that the

abolition or radical change of the Senate would soon come. Just

think of a Senate, when the Rebellion was on, with a list of life

members like this, viz., Buchanan, Fillmore, Pierce, Tyler, and

Van Buren! Of course, I mean no reflection on these eminent

men. But the possible extent of the evil is indicated. New

Hampshire with three Senators, New York with four, Pennsyl-

vania with three, Virginia with three, and the excess above other

States for life!  Would it not cause discontent?

  On the other hand, let the President when he leaves his office

take a manly view of the situation.  Let him become a citizen

again. It is stated that Mr. Cleveland will return to the practice

of his profession. I hope he will. It will be a noble answer to

the question. He is only six or seven years out of his law office

and can return to it.

  I should have done so if I could. But I was twenty years

out of practice. Leaving for the war in 1861 and an ex-Presi-

dent in 1881, it would have been an up-hill business [for me] to

return to the law. But I would like to see my short speech to

my neighbors when they welcomed me home in 1881 set out in

full, and then a short and unobtrusive showing of what has been









             <B>LIFE AS EX-PRESIDENT          443</B>



done to carry it out in practice. Indeed, I am quite as content

with what I have succeeded in doing as an ex-President as with

any other part of my life. . . . 

  Too much of this. In haste, as you see.

                           Sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES,

  MR. WILLIAM O. STODDARD,

    Hampstead, Long Island, New  York.

  February 6.  Wednesday.- Rev.  Dr. Spencer, of Philadel-

phia, agent of the Methodist Episcopal Church Extension So-

ciety, preached, exhorted, and sang last evening at the church.

Effectively done.  Mem.:--On such occasions, one man must

have charge, not merely lead. The volunteer interruptions chill

the feelings--a shower-bath on the rising warmth.

  President Merrick writes me a letter exhorting me  for the

sake of the example to "make a public profession of faith in

Christ." He is a noble, charitable, true Christian in the best

sense. He enclosed [an account of] the course taken by former

Senator and Attorney-General Williams in Portland, Oregon.

The distinguished gentleman is a convert, in the usual sense.

  February 7.  Thursday.--Last evening I received a letter

from the chairman on literary exercises for the New York cen-

tennial of Washington's inauguration, asking me to respond to

the toast "The President." I accept. I may allude to the failure

of the device for selecting the President by means of Electoral

Colleges in the several States, and turn [to say] but in other re-

spects their plan [that of the founders] has fully and exactly

fulfilled the anticipations of the wise and far-seeing founders. It

[the system] provided for the perils of the first years, Wash-

ington; and for the appalling dangers of the turning-point of our

destiny, Lincoln. It provides motives that enable the people's

will to govern at all times. If there is failure it is due to the

people themselves.



          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, February 7, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your favor of the 4th

instant in which I am honored with an invitation to respond to









<B>444          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



the toast "The President" at the banquet in the Metropolitan

Opera House, April 30 next. Undertaking the duty assigned,

it will be a satisfaction to know about at what time in the speak-

ing my ten minutes will be in order.  In accepting, I wish it dis-

tinctly understood that if, for any reason, even at the last mo-

ment, it seems desirable to shorten the program it will be en-

tirely agreeable to me to be one of those to be dropped out.

                     Very sincerely yours,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

HONORABLE ELBRIDGE GERRY,

   CHAIRMAN, New York.



  February 8. Friday. - Have at last got rid of correspondence

-that is caught up with it, and gave a couple of hours to my

old notes for a manual training speech or talk to the Allegheny

County Teachers' Association at Pittsburgh, Friday next, 15th.

  February 10. Sunday. - General Mitchell spent the day. He

came to present a [most promising] project for a speculation.

        But it is like going into business and I declined.

  General Mitchell's chance of the pension office for Ohio seems

good. Will write to the President at the proper time.

  February  19.     Tuesday.- The  trip  to  Columbus        [last

Wednesday] to meet the trustees of the Ohio State University

was caused by the burning of the chemical laboratory building--

not by the action of president and faculty in the case of students

absent from prayers. Loss some forty thousand dollars. We

asked for seventy-five thousand dollars to rebuild; five thousand

dollars for immediate use was already voted by the General

Assembly.

  I promised Colonel [Potter] and Lieutenant Kilbourn to aid in

restoring the boys, if they kept quiet and behaved well about it

for the next three to six weeks. The president was perhaps

rather severe, and somewhat hasty.

  Called on Mrs. Carter at Columbus to thank her for her kind

hospitality to Fanny. Mrs. Carter was not at home. But the

servant, with a beaming face, said: "Your daughter is so sweet.









             <B>ON MANUAL TRAINING AT PITTSBURGH          445</B>



 No lady ever visited here who was so nice- so lovely," etc.!

 Very pleasant sounds in a father's ears.

  Thursday night, after an hour's talk with Mr. Green of the

great wholesale dry-goods Columbus house, took cars to Pitts-

burgh in the night. At Monongahela House 7 A. M. in Pitts-

burgh. [The] forenoon with Mr. Luckey and Mr. M. A.

Newell, Superintendent of Instruction in Maryland, visited the

Grant School.  Surely it is all most gratifying--as great an ad-

vance on my day as the railroad and steamboat are on the pack

horse and flatboat of pioneer days.

  Afternoon, with Lucy Cook McCandless drove to the suburbs

of Pittsburgh out Fifth Avenue.

  Evening, at the First Presbyterian Church, to a crowded house,

[I] spoke fifty minutes on manual training. Omitted my best

witness and point - Canon Farrar on Christ "The Carpenter"!

But fairly well.

   Saturday in the rain to Cleveland. A happy visit with Mrs.

(widow) Linus Austin and Mattie Avery, both lonely without



  Monday met with trustees of Garfield Memorial Association

at Mr. J. H. Wade's office. I presided. Resolved to dedicate

during 1889 and chose General Cox, on my motion, orator of the

day. A happy call at General Leggett's. Home on late train.

  February 21, 1889.--To Findlay to attend Washington's

birthday celebration by the soldiers of the G. A. R. Stopped

at the Central House. Four [five] comrades of the old Twenty-

third were on hand to welcome me. They became my body-

guard and for two days looked after me as careful and consid-

erate friends.  "Auld Lang Syne" in a most gratifying sort!

Names of the comrades: Thomas W. Quine, Company E; F.

M. Drake, Company H; James Finley, G; Aaron Koplin, F;

Melville Figley, G.

  In the evening spoke at Stoker Post of the G. A. R. Gave my

"delusion" at Buford's Gap on retreat of Hunter from Lynch-

burg.

  February 22.  Friday.--A. M. Rode over the new parts of

the town of Findlay. - Said now to have over twenty thousand









<B>446          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



people. Factories in the outskirts widely separated. Town six

miles long north and south, and four wide east and west!

Several street railway lines. Rawness on all sides. Thirty-five

hundred new houses claimed for the last year; already said to

he eleven hundred for the current year.

  P. M. Two thousand of the school children in line in the

streets; all happy and warmly clad.  The crowds in the wigwam

and the noise of the young kids prevented myself, first, and Gib-

son, afterwards, from being heard. I was more fortunate even

than General Gibson.

  Evening, Commander O'Neal and I talked to a frost-bitten

audience in the wigwam.

  Think of this gentleman, this fair-minded, patriotic man,

wounded and a prisoner, and for six months in prison at Dan-

ville, Virginia, absolutely naked!

  I gave a sketch of the Valley campaign - Cedar Creek. Well

received.

  February 23.  Saturday. - Returned after speaking last night

and reached home after 11 P. M.

  This afternoon Webb came. He has, with the president of his

company, Mr. Lawrence, been in Chicago almost a week attend-

ing the convention of the electrical people. His connection with

the National Carbon Company at Cleveland interests him in this

conference.

  February 24.  Sunday. - A  week ago, at Mrs. Austin's, I

took up Hawthorne's "Notes." Interested so much I ordered

them, six volumes, from Robert Clarke and Company, Cincin-

nati, and since returning from Findlay have snatched an hour

or two from my correspondence to read these delightful sketches

and jottings.  They seem to have been his collection of the

raw materials for his charming stories. He has [a] sound head,

and is an original thinker, with a power of clean-cut statement.

His clearness and precision are notable.

  February 25.    Monday. - Writing letters [and] scrapbooking

military items, especially the Dublin Raid and Cloyd's Moun-

tain by Arthur.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, February 26, 1889.

  MY DEAR SENATOR: - Gibson for Commissioner of Pensions

will please more Ohio people than anything else I can think of.

All agree that the time has come to recognize the work he has

done for the country, for the party, and for all of us who have

been honored by Ohio during the last thirty years. This is one

of the things near my heart.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SENATOR JOHN SHERMAN.



        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, February 26, 1889.

  MY  DEAR GENERAL:--I have just read in the New  York

Tribune a communication from Findlay, Ohio, representing that

I gave your opinion on the subject of pensions as expressed by

you in conversation with me at Indianapolis.  In fact I did noth-

ing of the sort.  The opinions expressed are my opinions; but

you said, as I recall our conversation, nothing on the subject of

pensions, and if you had, I most certainly would not have re-

peated it.

  With all good wishes.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GENERAL BENJAMIN HARRISON,

    Washington, D. C.





  February 27. - Read in the last volume of the "Cyclopaedia of

Biography" the titles Zachary Taylor, Tilden, etc.  Jefferson

Davis is given as the writer of Taylor. It is well done. I read

also Jeff Davis' biography. Fairly well. The book [cyclo-

paedia] is a mine of history and biography and is in the main

excellent.  It is indexed fully and well.

  February 28.  Thursday.--Foggy;  snow still lingers.  The

last day of winter as we usually think of it. But March is also

a winter month.  Our first two winter months, December and

January, were much milder than usual--unprecedentedly so.

But February has been severely cold, probably colder than the

average.  Almost no good sleighing; perhaps on eight or ten

days sleighs were used but chiefly on the paved streets and stone

roads.

  Lucy will go to Cleveland tomorrow. We are to be in Dela-

ware March 7 at President McCosh's lecture. In Cincinnati I

am to attend Loyal Legion [on the] 6th.

  I wrote today the following letter to the President in behalf

of Captain Reed, who sent to Lucy the dispatch after Cedar

Creek that the report of my death was a mistake.



Private

             SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, March 5, 1889.

  MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:--This will introduce to you my

comrade and friend Captain Thomas B. Reed, of Fairmont,

West Virginia. He wants at the proper time to be reappointed

postmaster. He has every qualification - experience, efficiency,

character, Republicanism, service as a soldier, and the support

of the community.  You can trust him.

  Besides, he rendered me the greatest possible service in the

war.  The recollection of it simply compels me to ask your

favorable consideration of his claims and merits.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  To PRESIDENT HARRISON,

    Washington.



  March 1. Friday.--Last evening attended the meeting of

the G. A. R. post. Good feeling. Talked with a comrade, not

seen before.  He was a Swiss--brought to America when he

was six or seven years old. Was happy as he said: "We will

be in power again in a few days and we will keep it." A plain,

rough laboring man- patriotic in his talk. Another comrade

attracted me by his extraordinary stature. I did not recollect









             <B>APPRECIATION OF CLEVELAND          449</B>



seeing him before. I soon got on easy terms with him. He

said that in his stockings he had been six feet six, that he was

not quite so tall now. He was born in this county, but his

father came from Germany. He said: "My father always

said that you made a Republican of him. When he was to cast

his first vote after naturalization in 1848, his friends and neigh-

bors, Germans, were Democrats. But happening to be in Buck-

 land's office, you talked to him in favor of General Taylor, and

gave him a German newspaper. He read it and decided to vote

for Taylor, and had never since voted the Democratic ticket."

  I was called on to talk. Did so. Told the incident of Howell

Cobb trying to persuade the starving and dying prisoners in

Andersonville to work in the shops of the Confederacy-with

the promise of good pay, two dollars and fifty cents per day,

one-half gold, one-half in Confederate notes, and good shelter,

food, and clothing. But the prisoners knew this would add to

the muskets in the Rebel ranks and not a man yielded to escape

death and suffering. The applause was hearty.

  March 2.  Saturday. - Last evening attended a reception of

the Rebecca I. O. O. F.; made a short talk. Described the in-

augural proceedings, decoration of the city, flags, etc.; proces-

sions, flowers, music, ball, crowds. The pleasure and splendor

of the affair all depends on the weather. With fine weather it is

notably brilliant; with bad weather it is a notable failure.

  Attended to arranging papers. For a time will collect:-

1. All war talks - history, biography, and incidents. 2. All

matter relating to education, especially in the South, and on

manual training. 3. All on prison reform and charities.

  Does Rawle teach the doctrine of secession? Was this doc-

trine taught at West Point?      I do  not find these questions

answered in Jefferson Davis' book. He is quite full in his

presentation of the State-sovereignty doctrine.

  March 4. Monday. -Inauguration day! Bright and cheer-

ful. Perfect day here. Hope for same at Washington.

  The President and Mrs. Cleveland have in their personal con-

duct, so far as I know, behaved with discretion, modesty, good

nature, and good sense, with possibly one exception. For them

   29









<B>450          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



it is no doubt well to leave the high place now. Those who are

in such a place cannot escape its unfortunate influence on habits,

disposition, and character. In that envied position of power

and distinction, they are deferred to, flattered, and supported

under all circumstances whether right or wrong, or wise or fool-

ish, by shrewd and designing men and women who surround

them. Human nature can't stand this long.

  If the President and his wife are to return to private life at

all, it is better to do it at the end of four years. A longer life

in the artificial hothouse atmosphere of the high station

would leave an impress which would color unfavorably all of

their later years. Now Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland can escape the

tendencies, and in due time become again good and, I hope,

happy citizens.

  March 5. -The weather at Washington was unfavorable, but

the enthusiasm of the great multitude was genuine and carried

the ceremonial through successfully. The inaugural address is

conservative and altogether admirable.



                               CINCINNATI, March 5, 1889.

  MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: - I left home in Fremont this

morning, and on the way down read your inaugural address,

first hurriedly, and then with care. Some paragraphs I read

several times. I congratulate you, and the party, and the coun-

try upon it. It is throughout in substance and style altogether

admirable. Excuse me for alluding to its style. Jefferson and

Lincoln, by a long distance, excel all others in their inaugural

addresses.  Yours will take rank with theirs.  "It is all golden."

  I know you have no time to reply.  Do not.

  The Cabinet is excellent, and I specially rejoice that you have

Noble with you. I should have named him to you if I had not

been confined to native Southerners.

  Mrs. Hayes, if she were with me, would join in kindest re-

gards to Mrs. Harrison and yourself.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  PRESIDENT HARRISON.









             <B>HARRISON'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS          451</B>



  Cincinnati, March 6. 1889.- I reached here about 7 P. M.

last evening. On the way down from Toledo read the charming

message of the new President. I wrote to him this morning

congratulating him on it - substance and style.

  Called on General Cox. He said he was so averse to making

a second address on Garfield because his speech at Milwaukee,

at the reunion of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee, was

a formal affair and had been published not merely by the press

but in pamphlet form and widely circulated. It was in his

view bad taste to deliver it again. He concluded by saying,

"You must consider this final." I refused to so consider it. I

urged that justice to Garfield demanded of him the sacrifice of

his feelings; that Garfield had suffered in two ways by the in-

judicious praise of those who knew him only in a general way.

They had attributed to him powers and qualities which did not

belong to him, and which all who knew him well thoroughly

understood were not the truth about him. Others, his enemies,

took advantage of these mistakes and the result is a belittling

of his character and powers. He seemed, towards the close of

a rather protracted conversation, to yield and promised to take

it into consideration. The 19th of September was his decided

preference as to date.

  Saw Captain Hunter and Robert Clarke. Heard from Clarke

that Judge Matthews is probably not to recover. He has been

confined to his bed several weeks; can't endure his weakness

and weariness; wishes for the end to come.  Spent the fore-

noon - the rest of it - with my charming friend Mrs. Herron.

Mr.  Herron returned from  Washington before dinner.  Re-

mained to dinner and an hour after. Will appears well. Lucy

better and finer every time I see her.

  In the evening at the banquet of the Loyal Legion made a

talk; told of Captain Reed's thoughtful "saving from a shock"

my wife when I was reported killed at Cedar Creek.  Also a

talk about the blunder of Sheridan in his book, where he speaks

of the officers of Crook's corps and color-bearers who rose

seemingly out of the ground, the men having gone to the rear

panic-stricken. I succeeded in a rough, humorous vein in get-









<B>452          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ting hold of the audience and had a beautiful time of it. Noyes

told the story of his loss of his leg in fine style -with pathos,

humor, and eloquence. Others spoke well. A most happy time.

  March 8 [7].  Thursday.- At 8:30 A. M. to Delaware.  At

2:30 met Lucy on train from Cleveland. A happy meeting. She

had "a lovely" time with Cleveland friends. Called on Dr. and

Mrs. McCosh, of Princeton - for twenty years as an able and

successful president of that famous old Presbyterian college.  A

happy tea and reception at Professor Williams'.

  March 8. - Called on Carrie Williams Little, [and] on Judge

Jones who is in a critical condition - in bed for two weeks.

His clear head is now confused. He hardly knew how to talk.

Such grand and interesting conversation - so attractive to all

who knew him. I got the impression that he would pull through

this trouble. My saying so seemed most agreeable to his wife -

Mrs. Harriet Williams Jones. .  .  .  Home at 5 P. M.

  March 9.  Saturday.- Wrote a host of letters-chiefly to

friends anxious to serve their country! Signed about seventy

diplomas for newly elected members of the Loyal Legion. At-

tended I. O. O. F. in the evening.  Prepared some ideas for

speeches.

  March  11.  Monday. - Considered briefly my  ten-minutes'

talk at the G. A. R. welcome to Commander O'Neal tomorrow

evening. Will consider the merits of the organization - his-

torical, educational, patriotic, social, and benevolent and just.

The latter are to be looked after.

  March 12. Tuesday. -Commander O'Neal arrived on time

via Lake Shore from Ashtabula. I drove to breakfast with him.

    We talked of what is due to the soldier.  After dinner

called on General Buckland at his office and on Judge Dickin-

son at the probate court. Also called on Captain Anthony

Young.

  In the afternoon promptly the posts marched up [to Spiegel

Grove], about one hundred strong, then the Sons of Veterans

and a number of friends with ladies. Perhaps two hundred in









             <B>A LIBERAL PENSION POLICY          453</B>



all. A successful and happy time. Lucy was in her best estate,

making all happy.  . .

  In the evening a crowded audience greeted us all at the opera

house. Commander O'Neal with cogent arguments and solid

facts, with pathetic and thrilling scenes, urged the duty of a

more liberal policy on the subject of pensions.

  I spoke briefly--a jolly talk, with a serious sentence or two

ditto to O'Neal.

  Captain Dowling, candidate for commander, also spoke in

same vein. "The raid on the Treasury" is fairly on. I must make

a heading of the line, "A Raid on the Treasury"-"Justice to the

Soldier--No Repudiation of the Nation's Obligations to her

Defenders."

  March 13.  Wednesday.-With Mr. O'Neal to the station.

Bid good-bye to Captain and Mrs. Dowling and the judge about

9 A. M. after a successful meeting.

  Correspondence the forenoon. In the afternoon a visit from

McSheehy, just from Washington.  He gave the situation there

fairly well. A rabble of unwonted dimensions after office.

  The President makes a mistake in turning the appointments

over to the Senators and Representatives. They will use it

[them] to pay debts. It is a return to the spoils system.

  In the afternoon met at the Ball House a number of men

from Bowling Green and Gibsonburg with a party of railroad

men touching a new railroad from Fremont west to Gibsonburg,

Bowling Green, Napoleon, and the State line. After much talk,

result--resolutions to organize a corporation for the purpose.

Appointed a committee to carry out the resolution.

  March 14. Thursday. - Correspondence and a few minutes

given to the talk on Parnell and Ireland next Monday evening

occupied the forenoon.  . .

  Lucy received her invitation to dance in first quadrille at the

Washington inauguration ball in New York, April 29. Will of

course not be present; not opposed to balls or dancing; but other

circumstances will prevent. Will acknowledge and decline the

honor today.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 15, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR:-In the absence of Mrs. Hayes, I have the

honor to acknowledge your kind favor received yesterday, in

which she is honored with an invitation to take part in the open-

ing quadrille of the centennial ball.

  I regret that at this time it seems probable that circumstances

will prevent her from being in New York at the centennial cele-

bration of the inauguration of Washington, and that therefore

she must decline your polite invitation, which she highly appre-

ciates.

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MR. WARD MCALLISTER,

    MANAGER, New York.



                         FREMONT, OHIO, March  15, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I thank you for the privilege of uniting with

the New York Citizens' Committee in their patriotic and char-

itable work in behalf of the disabled and destitute soldiers of

the late Confederacy.

  The time is plainly drawing near (if it has not already come)

when justice to its defenders will require the National Govern-

ment to expend much larger sums than have heretofore been

appropriated for the support of the men who saved it. The

sacred obligation to the Union soldiers must not - will not be

forgotten nor neglected, especially by those who have shared

in fullest measure the prosperity which has come from the serv-

ices and sacrifices of those who stood by the Government when it

was imperilled.

  But those who fought against the Nation cannot and do not

look to it for relief. Their disabled and destitute comrades are

left to the generosity and benefactions of their more fortunate

fellow citizens who wisely forecast the inspiring future of our

country.   Confederate  soldiers and  their descendants  are to

share with us and our descendants the destiny of America.

Whatever, therefore, we their fellow citizens can do to remove

burdens from their shoulders and to brighten their lives is surely

in the pathway of humanity and patriotism.









             <B>AID FOR CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS          455</B>



With my contribution to the enterprise, I beg you to accept

also my best wishes for its success.

                     I remain sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MR. OLIVER DOWNING,

    SECRETARY, New  York.





  March 16. Saturday.--In the evening Lucy came from

Toledo and Webb with the architect, Mr. Barnum, from Cleve-

land. A happy time. Webb and Mr. Barnum went over with

Lucy the proposed addition and change of the rear of our house.

The change is intended to get rid of our little frame kitchen, to

enlarge the dining-room, to add chambers, and to improve the

general appearance by putting a two-story brick structure in the

place of what we now have which shall cost four thousand

dollars to six thousand dollars.



Private.

           SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, March 16, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Justice to Mr. Waggoner--the best officer

we have had in this revenue district--seems to require another

solid effort to restore him to the collectorship from which he

was improperly removed.

  If there is a reasonable prospect of success I venture to urge

you to push it to a favorable determination.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.





  March 17.--Sunday.--This being a lucky day -St. Pat-

rick's Day and Sunday,--I decided, if brick and other needed

things can be had, to build the new kitchen and dining-room.

The architects are Coburn and Barnum of Cleveland, and J.

Stierwalt will be the builder. Cost from four to six thousand

dollars.









<B>456          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  March 18. - Made contract for the addition to the house with

Stierwalt. He is to superintend and build it; three dollars per

day for time employed by him and twenty-five cents profit on

each carpenter - his regular hand.

  Correspondence and a little attention to the Irish question for

tonight's Saint Patrick's speech.

  Spoke first after the banquet. Well received. A sober talk

of twenty or thirty minutes.

  March  19.  Tuesday. - Morning train to Toledo.

Spent the afternoon with [Clark] Waggoner, an hour or two

of it. He has full scrapbooks of all matters for some years.

An interesting talk. Some chance of his restoration to his office

of collector of internal revenue. He was the best we have had

and was unfairly and improperly turned out in Arthur's time.

  An hour in the morning with Lee. He thinks we should have

an aggressive man - a speaker and strong - for governor.  Does

he have his own eye on the place?

  March 22. Friday.- Letters. Received one from Rev. Dr.

Hatfield criticizing mine to the secretary of the Texas Home. I

reply as follows:-



Confidential.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 22, 1889.

  MY FRIEND:-Your letter of the 18th, I must believe, was

written in the friendliest spirit but without reflection. In any

event I do not argue. Logic is for controversy. It has little to

do with opinions.    Let me ask you to think of some facts.

Eighteen Republican members of the next House are from the

late Rebel regions. But for the votes of Rebels President Har-

rison would find the next House against him by from fifteen to

thirty majority.

  The old Mason and Dixon's line, politically considered, now

runs coincident with the southern line of North Carolina and

Tennessee.

  Many of the most decided and reliable Republicans to be

found anywhere fought in the Rebel army. The number of

such is today greater than ever before, and with a little political









             <B>DANGER OF PLUTOCRACY          457</B>



sense in our leadership, which we are sure to have, it will stead-

ily grow.

  With a small percent of late Rebel votes at any poll--"old

soldiers handy with the pistol"--the votes of negroes will be

cast, and counted as cast. Without such support the prospect

of the colored vote is dim enough. Calmly think of these facts.

  Again, Jefferson, Calhoun, and the instructors at West Point

taught that the State was sovereign and that the Federal Gov-

ernment had only limited powers; that allegiance was due to

the State. Is it wise (not to say charitable) to attribute to all

who followed such instruction guilt of the quality of that of

Judas Iscariot?

  But the essential idea of my letter does not seem to have

attracted your attention.  The rich, the well-to-do, and those

who depend mainly on them, are strangely blind, as a class, to

what is due--in short, to justice to the Union soldier.  Bonds

for money lent the Government in paper, worth thirty-five to

sixty-five cents on the dollar, are paid in gold at their face,

with gold interest at highly remunerative rates. That national

obligation, I with you and the rich people insisted upon, because

it was just. But the men paid twenty to thirty cents a day for

life and uncounted sacrifices are said to make a "raid on the

Treasury," if they ask that promises be kept. Hence my letter.

  My brother, the question of our day is, Shall a plutocracy own

the earth, and all who work with their hands be left in ignorance

and vice by reason of poverty? Don't worry about the Rebels

of the South. The real enemy of human souls sits in your

costliest church. The anarchist is the offspring of European

despotism and aristocracy.     Plutocracy,  unchecked,  will have

the same progeny here.

  You have a power of statement that always filled me with

admiration and delight. Of all places, the pulpit should be the

home of truth. The model sermon is the Sermon on the Mount.

  In all good feeling and in all earnestness.

                    Your friend, sincerely,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  REV. R. M. HATFIELD D. D.,

    Evanston, Illinois.









<B>458          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  March 23.  Saturday.--Last  evening Mr. Keeler by tele-

phone told us of the death of Justice Stanley Matthews in Wash-

ington yesterday morning.     He  has been  seriously ill many

months, and I have not hoped with any confidence for his re-

covery since early last winter.

  I became acquainted with him at Kenyon College more than,

or perhaps about, forty [fifty] years ago. Although he was

almost two years younger than I was, he was two years in ad-

vance of me in college. He graduated in 1840 and I in 1842.

We have been well acquainted ever since; during a large part

of the time intimately.    Our  friendship was an understood

thing between us for years without intimate intercourse.

  In college he fell under the displeasure of the faculty and

was not likely to graduate.  It was a case for apology and

regret. On the campus, it was the subject of discussion. Others

urged him to show independence--not to make an apology.

This seemed the drift of all minds and he yielded to it, or

rather, seemed about to do so. I interposed firmly and decidedly.

"No, Matthews, the thing you ought to do is to apologize. It is

right.  For the sake of your parents, for your own sake, you

ought to do it. I would do it, if I were in your place." This

turned the scale. The apology was made; he graduated; and

during his whole life was extremely grateful to me, alluding to

the incident very often as the turning-point in his career.

  We went into the war together in the same regiment, the gal-

lant old Twenty-third.  After 1860 we were together in politics.

I appointed him judge of the Supreme Court-although not

confirmed on my appointment. I held Garfield to it and secured

his confirmation, which was by a single vote. I supported him

for Senator in 1877 and contributed to, if I did not control, the

result.

  He was an example of great precocity. At sixteen he could

write and speak with the solid ability of mature manhood. He

was easily a fine scholar in all his studies; was noted for the

accuracy and felicity of his translations. His opinions and argu-

ments in law cases were models of forensic force and clearness.

I regarded his argument before the Electoral Commission as

the great argument, and as controlling in the case.









             <B>CHARACTER OF STANLEY MATTHEWS          459</B>



   After graduating he went to Tennessee. There practiced law

and married. About 1845 or 1846 he returned to Ohio. He im-

mediately came here [Fremont] to be examined, and was here

admitted to the bar. I was on the committee of examination.

We were then young lawyers, just beginning. We conversed

freely and confidentially as to our plans and hopes. He was

somewhat discouraged. When I went to Cincinnati in 1849 he

was just entering on a successful career in his profession; was

elected a judge of common pleas at the first election under the

new constitution, and showed a signal ability; so much ability

that the lawyer of the most lucrative practice of any lawyer in

the city, Mr. Vachel Worthington, offered him  a partnership.

This was accepted and he became at once a leader at the bar.

He was a Democrat, having been a Liberty party abolitionist.

His associations were with a circle of fast men for some years.

He was elected a [state] Senator. His talents took him to the

front. Just in time, he became interested in a revival of re-

ligion; took part in a business men's prayer-meeting at noon in

the old First Church and joined the Presbyterian Church.

  The most affecting funeral I recall was about this time, when

three of his sons, fine, promising little fellows who had died

of yellow [?] fever, were buried at one time!

  He became a Douglas Democrat 1858-9-60. We became more

intimate, and, as referred to above, arranged to go together into

the war. In 1875-6 we were together in politics, and became

confidentially intimate.

  He was able, conscientious, firm, and just. Throughout the

contest of 1876-7 and 8, he was fully advised of all movements

in which I was a party. In the Senate a short time, he did not

show political wisdom. The failure was not merely in party

tactics, but on grave questions like the currency. On all legal

and constitutional questions, however, he exhibited great power.

One short speech in a late night session was pronounced by

great odds the finest and grandest of anything done during his

service in the Senate. Vice-President Wheeler said he never

heard its equal.

  March 24.  Sunday.- Yesterday afternoon a meeting of the

Sandusky County Bar Association was held in the probate court,









<B>460          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Judge Dickinson.  General Buckland presided; Meek, secretary.

I gave a talk on Judge Matthews. No one present except me

knew that Matthews was examined and admitted to practice in

this county in August 1845. I was one of the committee. I

spoke of it, of his wonderful precocity. His career. His con-

firmation and his marked ability on the bench.

  March 25. Monday. - I go this morning to act as pall-bearer

at the funeral of my friend Judge Matthews. I find a letter

of his in which he alludes to our college friendship, professional

intercourse, the closer comradeship of the war, and our intimate

association in the electoral contest of 1876-7, in hearty terms.

  Paul, his youngest son, dispatched me yesterday twice on the

subject of the funeral and expressed the gratification of the

family that I could act.

  This will be the closing scene at Glendale. I recall the pathetic

funeral of his three boys who died of scarlet [?] fever; the

departure for the war, when I spent a night at Glendale and

was assured by his mother and wife of their special satisfaction,

and the comfort it gave them, that I could be with Stanley; and

then the funeral of his first wife! This is the fourth and last!

  Guy M. Bryan, of Texas, is the only college or school friend

left who remains among those who were at school with me and

who also has been a friend in manhood.





                                   SPIEGEL, March 25, 1889.

  MY  DEAR Guy:- You are the last!  I go today to attend

as pall--bearer the funeral of our college friend, Judge Matthews!

  I thought of you when I got the request to write a note in

behalf of the Confederate Home at Austin. The request chimed

with my feelings; but if it had not, recollections of you and of

Texas and Texas friends of 1848-9 would have conquered.

  The Charleston News questions Stewart.  I hope he is all he

should be. God bless you!

                      Hastily.  As ever,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.









             <B>FUNERAL OF STANLEY MATTHEWS          461</B>



  March 28.  Thursday.-Returned last evening from attend-

ing the funeral of my friend for fifty years, Stanley Matthews.

Last Monday reached Cincinnati about 7 P. M. [Spent night at]

my friend Herron's.  . . .  Tuesday, until 9:30 A. M., with

Mrs. Herron. Read enough in [book of] ex-Secretary of the

Treasury Hugh McCulloch, to see that it was intelligent, fair,

and well worth a place in all American libraries. [Then] to the

Hamilton and Dayton station and met there the funeral party -

Judges Harlan, Lamar, Gray, and - . with the family.  Met

Judges Barr, Sage, Jackson on train to Spring Grove. There

a brief service in the chapel--respectful, suitable, and nothing

overdone. I walked on the right of Judge Harlan into the chapel

with the honorary pall-bearers, we at their head. Greatly grati-

fied by the good things said of Matthews by Harlan. "A great

judge, a heavy loss to the court; a rapid worker; accurate and

skilful; wise and able; growing all of the time."

  Arranged with Judge Harlan that he should see the President

in two or three cases.

  Dined, or lunched, at Glendale with the family. Greeted as

an old friend--as "Uncle Rud" by Jane (affianced to Judge

Gray) -  [by] Mrs. Matthews the widow, Eva, Mrs. Cleveland

(Grace), and the young fellows, Mortimer and Paul. Very

glad I attended.

  Just caught [afternoon] train at Little Miami depot-the

Panhandle. On board with members of the Legislature, Cap-

tain Clark and another member.  Talked war, oratory, and anec-

dotes all of the way to Columbus.

  Reached Laura's about 9 P. M.  . . .   Talked with the

general as to his "seeking" the pension agency.

  Called on Captain Cope; agrees with me as to President Scott's

insufficiency. His indiscreet, not to say unjust, dealing with

the boys, Kilbourn and Potter; too great severity.

  About 11:15 A. M. [yesterday] Bee Line to Wellington. A

fine talk with Dr. Townshend, professor [at] Normal School;

[with] two soldiers. At Wellington, a happy meeting with my

friend Warner.  Thence home on the Wheeling.  On train met

young Gardiner and wife lately home from Hot Springs and two

young Norwalk men.









<B>462          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Home at 5:30 P. M. All well. The work on the building

goes on in lively fashion.

  Now for my three speeches--Loyal Legion banquet April

9; G. A. R. April 24; New York Centennial, 29th.

  March 29.  Friday.- I have been fortunate in my friends.

They have been the blessing and comfort of my life. Their loss

has been the cause of my greatest suffering and sadness. Some

ladies. Beginning with my sister Fanny.

  Many of the dearest have become army friends. And the

experiences of war added largely to their number. Indeed, if

the war had brought no other happiness, no other good to me,

it would have been a blessed event by reason of the list of

valued friends that it gave me. And of these death has begun

to claim its own. General Comly died in 1887, and now Stanley

Matthews has gone.

  March 30, 1889.  Saturday. -  We may say of Matthews what

was said of Shakespeare in the 1623 edition of his works:-

"His mind and hand went together. What he thought he

uttered with that easiness that we have scarce received from him

a blot in his papers."





                          FREMONT, OHIO, March 31, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I venture to suggest for appointment to the

Supreme Court in the place of Justice Matthews, John N.

Jewett, of Chicago. I believe he possesses the requisite character,

qualifications, and reputation. His residence in the State of the

Chief Justice ought not to stand in the way. A similar case in

Ohio, with repeated appointments for more than a quarter of a

century, without serious complaint, furnishes a sufficient reply to

this objection. Besides, the great Republican State of Illinois

should not be shut off by a Democratic appointment.

                       Very sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  [THE PRESIDENT (?)].









             <B>FORTUNATE IN FRIENDSHIP          463</B>



              SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, April 2, 1889.

To THE FAMILY OF STANLEY MATTHEWS,

  LATE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

  COURT.

  Mr. Justice Matthews began his illustrious professional career

in Ohio with his admission to the bar in this town. The lawyers

here have always regarded him with peculiar interest and were

among his warmest admirers and friends. They assembled

promptly upon receiving the melancholy tidings of his death and

adopted the sentiments set forth in their proceedings, which I

now have the honor to transmit. I beg also to present my

personal assurances of sympathy and regard.

                       Very sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.



                            FREMONT, OHIO, April 4, 1889.

  MY DEAR H-:-No, I had not read the suggestion of the

governorship.  My thought was for you the senatorship against

Payne. At any rate, let us have a fight on, which has a bone in

it. The buying of places in the Senate! The government by

corruption is the evil. I do not want [to] be or even to seem too

good.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  [Unidentified. ]



            SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, April 6, 1889.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I have the honor to accept with pleasure the

invitation of the Committee on the Centennial Celebration of the

Inauguration of George Washington as President of the United

States, to attend the celebration in New York April 29 and 30

and May 1, 1889.

                       Very sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES..

  CLARENCE W. BOWEN,

    SECRETARY, New York.

Private.

                    FREMONT, OHIO, April 13, 1888 [1889].

  MY DEAR SIR:--I have your kind note about the toasts, etc.

Do not be at any trouble about it. If I am to respond, the toast

will be, as I understand, "The Presidency." If this is correct,

it is all I care to know on the subject.

  Mrs. Hayes and my daughter, Miss Fanny, will be in New

York, it is now confidently expected. Of course, I would like

to have them attend at such part of the entertainment as ladies

attend, if it is practicable. Please advise me. Of course I will

pay for tickets which are sold.

                        Sincerely,

                                   RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  [CLARENCE W. BOWEN,

    SECRETARY, New York.]



  April 14, 1889. - Monday, 8th, I reached Delaware about 3:30

P. M. and attended meeting of committee on presidency.  Dr.

Bashford lectured in William Street Church to a fine audience

on the way Oregon was saved by Lee and Whitman, the mis-

sionaries, to the Union. Interesting but by no means great. He

is young, ambitious, good-tempered. He is [a] third-party pro-

hibitionist and a free-trader,--as we heard objected to him on

all sides.  He will hardly be selected.  With high qualities, he

would do. But an ordinary man with these political objections!

  Tuesday, 9th, to Cincinnati. Attended at Legion headquarters

with General Brinkerhoff.

  [The] 10th, Wednesday, Congress met of the Legion.  Sixth

quadrennial. Called to order and entered on the business, which

was the revision of the constitution. Committee's report taken

up in committee of the whole. Active men, Senator Manderson,

chairman of committee, Colonel Nicholson, General Cochran,

Major Lambert, the members from Missouri, Kansas, Illinois,

etc., etc. A full body except Oregon. About fifty members.

  In the evening a glorious banquet. Well served, good singing,

excellent speaking.  The best were Major Lambert, General Man-

derson, [and] "Cash" Goodloe, with his splendid Kentucky brag.









             <B>LOYAL LEGION CONGRESS          465</B>



I delivered the talk on Matthews. Well received. Had a wretched

bad cold- caught, how?  In the heat of the banquet a window

open behind me let a draught on the back of my head. Said Gen-

eral McCook (Alex McD.): "A man with a draught on the

back of his head sees his coffin in front of his face."

  The presence of General Crook and many West Virginia Army

men carried us through. The Eastern men were most agreeable.

A fine meeting. Stayed one night with Lucy at Mrs. Herron's.

Friday noon left [for home].

  April 17.- Lucy returned last evening after more than a

week's absence visiting Cleveland and Cincinnati. "No place like

home" expressed her feelings as she came into the hall.

  I must now, until I am ready for the Centennial [at New

York] and the G. A. R. at Dayton, pay no more attention as a

rule to office-seekers' letters.





                            FREMONT, OHIO, April 19, 1889.

  SIR --Dr. Ireland, the author of the great work entitled "The

Republic," has applied, or will apply, for some such place as In-

dian inspector, superintendent of Yellowstone Park, or of Indian

schools, and it will specially gratify me if the doctor can be ap-

pointed. I need not say that I regard him as altogether compe-

tent and worthy.

                        Respectfully,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  THE PRESIDENT,

    Washington, D. C.



  April 20. Saturday. -My little ten-minute speech [for the

New York celebration] is printed; modest, unambitious, and

fairly suited to the occasion.

  April 22. Monday. - I go to Columbus this morning; thence

to Dayton. A meeting at Columbus of the university board and

at Dayton of G. A. R., Department of Ohio. Home Thursday,

and to New York centennial with Lucy Friday. - A busy week.

  April 27. Saturday. New York.- With Lucy and Fanny

left home yesterday 11:30 A. M. train over to Cleveland. Com-

panion Judge Slagel, of Pittsburgh, and daughter, so far. Fan

left with Webb to come on tomorrow. En route with Lucy met

former president of the Senate, 1876-1, Perry, of Michigan, Gov-

ernor Luce, ditto, and others. A happy ride. Left Lucy at Mrs.

J. O. Moss', 18 West Forty-ninth Street. Came to Fifth [Avenue

Hotel]; found Colonel Corbin in my room as expected, [also]

his daughter and Miss Phillips, both fine-looking girls, from

Farmington. A letter from ex-President Cleveland excusing

himself from Monday's work by reason of a cold. Met Dawes

at table. Called on by Cincinnati men to attend a banquet of the

Society of the Cincinnati and to respond to a toast - "The United

States"; and my speech will be little more than "God bless

the United States!" The United States is a blessing to the

people who dwell within its limits - to the people of this con-

tinent-to the people of the whole globe, and therefore my

speech is simply, "God bless the United States."

  May 3, 1889.  New  York.--The Centennial wound up in

glory. Our visit has been a good one. My banquet speech was

well received. We like Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland. Harrison has

done well. He is a graceful orator. Probably no President has

equalled him in handsome speaking. We dined, Lucy, Fanny,

and I, with the Harrisons, Vice-President Morton and Mrs. Mor-

ton, at Colonel Shepard's No. 2 Fifty-second Street, just out of

Fifth Avenue.    A  most agreeable dinner.  Crosby, Bateman,

and wife. The Harrison family are Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Mc-

Kee, Russell Harrison and wife. Mr. and Mrs. Loring present.

  May 4. Saturday. - Last evening attended a semi-political

symposium at Colonel Shepard's. Southern governors and three

officers of the New York Southern Society, with the interesting

purpose to talk up the Southern situation and other problems

now requiring solution, gave interest to the unusual meeting.

  There were present, our host, Colonel Shepard; on his right,

at the large square table (perhaps sixteen feet square), were

General Gordon, on his left, General Buckner (governors respec-

tively of Georgia and Kentucky); next, on Gordon's right, my-









             <B>WASHINGTON CENTENNIAL          467</B>



self; on Buckner's left, Mr. Senator Evarts. This was the head of

the table. On the right side Mr. St. John, John C. Calhoun

(grandson of the great statesman), Mr. -, and Judge Davis.

On the square opposite Colonel Shepard, Chauncey Depew was

at the center, General Butterfield on his left, General Howard on

his right. On the fourth side were Russell Harrison, Mr. Plum-

mer, Mr. , and Mr.

  It was a notable assembly.  The dining-room stately and ele-

gant.  After dinner, beginning about 7 P. M. and ending about

9:30 P. M., Colonel Shepard rose and spoke of the Southern

problem, without defining it, and called on Governor Gordon.

He spoke in a friendly spirit, fluently and at times eloquently.

The importance and rights of the States were dwelt upon, and

he closed with decided devotion to the perpetuity and supremacy

of the Union.

  Next Governor Buckner spoke of the gravity of the negro

problem-too large to be discussed fully in an after-dinner

speech. But [he] alluded to the Anglo-Saxon race in the usual

way of our Southern friends and then touched handsomely the

question of increasing wealth on the eastern border of the Union.

"The centre of population is steadily moving west and the centre

of wealth is moving east."  Wealth gets in fewer hands, etc.,

etc. Then an anti-tariff speech as the main cause of this. De-

votion to [the] Union and the general Government.

  Mr. Shepard in one of his talks of introduction alluded to the

inequality of representation in the Senate, and suggested a

change in the future as to small States coming in hereafter.

Next he introduced me with high compliments. When he closed,

and the toast in my behalf had been drunk, as in all cases, by

the company standing, Governor Gordon rose and said he wanted

to say a few words touching my Presidency. He said:--"I op-

posed as a party man, in full sympathy with my party, the elec-

tion of Mr. Hayes in the canvass, and in all the exciting events

of the contest over the result I was for Mr. Tilden and thought

he was elected. But I want to say in this more public way,

what I have always said privately, that I came to know Mr.

Hayes intimately during his Presidency, and I believe no man

ever sat in the Presidential chair with higher, nobler, more single-









<B>468          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



minded purposes towards all sections of the country and towards

all his countrymen than Mr. Hayes." This and a few sentences

more in the same strain. It was well received by the company.

  I expressed my appreciation of his kind words in a single sen-

tence. Then I spoke of the few things we must accept as settled

-negro suffrage and the senate representation [of the States]

--an equal representation of them, great and small. I spoke

of [the] desirability of holding the Constitution as it is, etc., etc.

Then of the remedies for evils- education and an increasing

regard for the whole Union by the whole people, --"One country,

one Constitution, one destiny." Well received.

  May 8.  Wednesday.--Home again!  Lucy and I left New

York at 6 P. M. Monday evening after a most delightful visit of

more than a week.  Mr. and Mrs. Moss crowned its pleasures by

their friendly and attractive hospitalities. With Mr. Moss I

traversed on Sunday and Monday, 4th and 5th, the Central Park

and the new parks north of it--"Morning[side]" and "River-

side"-and the boulevard and great streets, Seventh Avenue,

St. Nicholas, etc., etc. Nothing could be more inspiring in the

way of city growth and material prosperity. A few years will see

the part of New York north of Central Park the finest city the

world ever had. All buildings, large and costly. The ground is

too valuable for poor buildings. Almost no poor buildings will

be there.

  May 9. Thursday.- Busy all day yesterday with corres-

pondence. The editor of [the] New York Evening Post wants

my notes to print [of] what I said of John Bright. It was not

in my printed slips used when I spoke at the banquet.

  At Mr. Moss' we met several agreeable people. I would like

to recall Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus Clark, who live on the Riverside

in the Brockholst Livingston place; Judge and Mrs. Hawes; Mr.

and Mrs. Flagler and their daughter; Mr. and Mrs. Ewart; Mrs.

Brice; Mr. Varnum.

  The growth of New York grows on me as the salient fact

about it.

  I am to speak Memorial Day at Sandusky. Let me in an

offhand speech give them: -1. Lincoln by "Gath," by Punch,









             <B>NEW YORK'S GREAT GROWTH          469</B>



and his Gettysburg speech. 2. For ideas of the war ("ideas

rule the world"), let me give the speech at Indianapolis, Decem-

ber 19, 1888.

  May 15. Wednesday.-While we were at breakfast this morn-

ing, a carpenter [William Seward]  at work on our addition-

8:30 A. M. -  fell by the scaffolding from the top of the gable,

perhaps thirty feet, to the ground, south side of the house near

the two oaks.  One of the oaks broke the fall as he fell into it.

His leg and perhaps an arm were broken. . .  .  I told him

and his wife we would take care of him here.  But the doctors

and all thought it best to remove him to his home at once.  This

was done by men carrying him on a lounge.  . . . Dr. John

Rice, a skilful surgeon, made light of the wounds. He told me

afterwards: "The man is seriously hurt but I make it as easy for

him as I can. There is much in faith cure in many cases. Let

the nervous system be agitated and the dangers are all increased.

The use of opium is to set at rest the nerves."

  "Accidents are hereditary," said Dr. John B. Rice. "His father

was nearly killed by an accident. Don't you see the old man looks

like Secretary Seward?"  "But this man is a German." -"I

know, but it is the same stock."

  May 21.  Tuesday. -Attended the funeral of Major S. A. J.

Snyder, the gallant and unfortunate hero of the Seventy-second.

A cold raw afternoon.  The fife was mournful.  After the firing

over the grave and the march begins we should omit the lively

music.  Let it for the sake of friends be slow and sweet and

mournful.

  May 24.  Friday.- Worked in grove trimming trees, mowing

grass, and the like. In the evening at the council chamber made

a short speech in behalf of the Fremont and Tiffin Railroad. It

now looks as if it would be built.

  May  25.  Saturday.- Worked at mowing, trimming trees,

and the like. What a pleasure I find in improving my place!

The house annex grows apace and is very satisfactory.

  June 1.  Saturday.--Returned  yesterday P. M. with Lucy

from Decoration Day at Sandusky. A most agreeable host and

hostess at Sandusky -Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Hoover.









<B>470          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  June 3.  Monday. --Yesterday at church A. M.  In the after-

noon with Eugene Rawson Post and the Sons of Veterans to

complete at the cemetery the Memorial Day ceremonies inter-

rupted by the rain-storm the 30th.  Volleys were fired and the

ritual read by Commander Green and the prayer by Comrade

Taylor.

  The rain-storm burst a reservoir [last Saturday] near Johns-

town [Pennsylvania], and the most appalling accident ever in

the United States was the result. A town ruined of perhaps

twenty thousand people with a loss of life reported from eight

hundred to ten thousand! No reliable data, however. A dam

one hundred and ten feet high; a pool of three miles long and

one half mile wide, two hundred feet higher than the town, three

miles distant in a valley.

  June 4. Tuesday. - I go to Columbus via Fostoria to attend

a meeting on the presidency of Wesleyan. Dr. Bashford is the

probable candidate of our choice. The qualifications of charac-

ter, attainments, and talents, he seems to possess. He votes the

third-party ticket. If he is a third-party partisan politician, he

ought not to be selected. No politician ought to be chosen. It is

hard for a third-party man not to be a bigot and a partisan.

  Fifty-five years ago we, Mother, Uncle, and Fanny -this day

fifty-five years gone- started in the old-fashioned stage-coach

from Delaware for this place, then Lower Sandusky! All the

dear ones of that day have gone.

  June 6.  Thursday. -The trip to Columbus was altogether

successful.

  The great horror at Johnstown on all minds and tongues.

Ohio, with Governor Foraker's promptitude, first to furnish aid.

  June 8. - Fanny surprised us by returning last evening.  She

looks well and has had a most agreeable month since we parted

with her in New York. She has visited schoolmates - Miss

Derr, at Wilkes-Barre, Miss Bulkley, at Hartford, Miss

at Holyoke, and school friends at Farmington.

  Rev. Dr. Broadus, of Louisville, has accepted the place of trus-

tee of the John F. Slater Fund.
