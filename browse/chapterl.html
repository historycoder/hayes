  APRIL 17, 1890.  Thursday. -- To New York [from Phila-

delphia] with Fanny, Webb, and Rutherford. . . . At

3 P. M. bells sounded and steamer [Trinidad] off! Met two

Loyal Legion [men], Colonel Cooper and Lieutenant Beardsley,

both of New York Commandery. Introduced to Lewis, business

manager of Springfield Republican and Mr.----. Captain Frazier

is a plain, blunt, agreeable model of a sailor, native of Nova Sco-

tia. Thirty passengers--all at dinner at 6 P. M. A noble view

of New York harbor, "Liberty," etc., as we sailed away. Ruth-

erford took kodaks on the ship.

  April 18. -- Sea not rough.  No symptoms of nausea.

  Read in Philadelphia Inquirer of 17th a good editorial quoting

and commending my nihilistic paragraphs in the Loyal Legion

speech of the 16th. A majority of the passengers do not appear

at meals. I am able to appear at all; not entirely well but when

engaged in talking do not notice any sickness. Made acquain-

tance of Howard Sherman, of New Haven, an agreeable man of

perhaps my age; with Carr, of Chicago, and others. At tea felt

some uneasiness and went to bed early. Fanny sick. When I

told her I did not suffer, she kissed me saying, "You scorpion!"

  April 20.  Sunday.--At 5:30 A. M., Fanny and I, on invi-

tation of our generous and jovial captain, took our places with

him on the bridge as we entered the difficult and crooked pas-

sage into the harbor of the Bermuda Islands. Rocky and inter-

esting entrance. Coffee was ordered up for us, and we took in

scenery and coffee with great satisfaction.

  Soon a steam barge came alongside and a handsome young

lieutenant of the British navy said to me: "The Admiral sends

his compliments and says he wishes to do all he can to make

your visit to Bermuda agreeable. He places at your disposal

either a boat or a steam launch and crew during your stay in

Bermuda." I acknowledged the courtesy of Admiral Watson,

etc., etc.

  We soon got into the intricate channel.  The colored pilots

pointed out the frequent shoals, easily seen by the color of the

water and the buoys constantly in view and near to each other.

As we passed this place, "Soncy," Fanny waved her handker-

chief. As we approached the landing we saw General Hastings

getting into a boat, with which he came out and took us ashore.

Then a rain-storm as we drove to "Soncy" forced us to take

refuge under the cedars. In a short time the sun came out.

What a paradise of a home we found Soncy to be. I wept to

think that Lucy never saw it. Nothing finer or lovelier was ever

seen in a dream.  I found the most marked attentions from the

British navy and from General Newdigate, the governor, wait-

ing me in the way of invitations, etc., etc. My time will be fully

occupied.

  April 21.  Monday. -- The attractions of this lovely place:--

Sufficiently diversified surface -- the highest point two hundred

feet; water views, combining all of the capital advantages, viz.,

river, lake, and ocean. No river in fact, nor lake; but the is-

lands, inlets, and projections, with the tide, give it all the views.

Flowers and beautiful shrubs everywhere; birds and fish and

sea things; enough forest, white cottages, old walls, winding

narrow roads, walled and with vines, blue skies and water; cli-

mate, never too hot nor too cold -- ranging in the whole year be-

tween fifty degrees and eighty-five degrees extreme; the rock-

bound coast facing the ocean on the north; the large proportion

of agreeable society people; no beggars, but all in comfortable

condition--without riches, without poverty; good soft water

collected on the white clean roofs, or on large spaces of rock

cleaned of the earth.

  P. M. made pleasant calls on the governor, General Newdi-









             <B>PLEASANT DAYS IN BERMUDA          567</B>



gate and Mrs. Newdigate, and on Admiral Watson and Mrs.

Watson and her fine daughter. Both gentlemen and ladies every

way agreeable and courteous.

  The admiral told of two hundred cases of grippe on his ship

within three weeks. Also, of a Swedish ship too weak-handed

to go further en route from Jamaica to Sweden; same cause.

  Today, ten months ago, the fatal stroke came to Lucy.

  My room faces south or southeast. From the window at which

I am writing, I look out on a little lawn, with cedars and shrubs,

of an oval shape, with the blue water of the cove around its

curve and the main channel in plain sight half a mile away.

  A very paradise! Oh, that the darling could have shared it

with me!

  April 22.  Tuesday.--We received many calls [yesterday]

in the afternoon and evening.

  The rocky ways, fences, deep cuts -- all often clad with beauti-

ful vines, such as the acalypha [and] the hibiscus. Then many

fine trees, as the royal palms or granite palms or mountain cab-

bage palms, the screw palm or pandanus utilis; also the Pride of

India.

  Lunch 1 P. M. to 4 P. M. with Captain Kinahan at dockyard.

        In the evening at a dance at the governor's, Lieutenant-

General Newdigate. Lively. Ladies fine-looking; the red jackets

gave life and style to the men.  Left at ten. . . .  A good day.

  April 23.  Wednesday. -- Emily [Mrs. Hastings] has a recep-

tion this afternoon to which many are invited. Captain Kinahan

sends the naval band. Others send flowers and all help is offered.

"What good neighbors we have !" she exclaims. Evidently these

Bermudians are a friendly folk; good people to live among.

  What a delicious and stimulating climate! Can one take cold

in it? "One cannot get a cold in Bermuda," is my feeling.

  The reception this afternoon passed off well.  Weather good,

guests very numerous, very hearty and cordial; in manner not

unlike a gathering of Kentucky gentlemen and ladies. Many

Americans present.

  Of course the officials and notabilities of the islands were









<B>568          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



here. The governor and wife, the admiral, the bishop, the clergy,

etc., etc.

  April 24.  Thursday. -- We had a beautiful day. The drive to

St. George's was most interesting; visited Tom Moore's cottage

-- a lovely nook, water views, rocks, trees, flowers. St. George's,

with narrow crooked streets, was like a Spanish town with

tumble-down decay in prominence. The old church, built in 1611-

20. A long and interesting [talk] with the police magistrate who

had to deal with the Rebels in 1861-65. All the offscourings

were in St. George's--blockade running, drinking, and rioting.

He took and has the evidence against Governor Blackburn, of

Kentucky, as to yellow fever garments collected to send to the

cities of the United States. His name is W. C. J. Hyland, St.

George's.

  In the evening dined with Mrs. Eames at the Hamilton House,

Present: "My Lord" Bishop Llewellyn Jones and wife, Rev.

---- Jaines, Hon. ---- Darrell and wife, General Hastings and

wife, Fanny and self, and Mrs. ---- Eames.  An agreeable,

chatty dinner party.

  April 25. Friday.-At 9:30 A. M. went with the general, Emily,

Fanny, Miss Briggs, and the children to the Princess Hotel. Met

the slender American-looking lieutenant, with his steam launch

from the admiral, [and] taken to Admiral Watson's review.

Artillery, sailors, and marines reviewed and drilled.  I was sa-

luted with twenty-one guns as I approached. Stood with Ad-

miral Watson and reviewed. Fine marching, drill, and firing.

  A little lunch at Mrs. Kinahan's (the Meigs). Taken on the

Canada by Captain ----; then to the flag-ship.  A formal lunch.

American flags; shown over the fine ship--old but good and effi-

cient. The life of her eight-inch guns two hundred and fifty

rounds. Afternoon, at Admiral Watson's "at home." With him

visited the Caves and home again at 5:30 P. M. A field day, in-

deed!

  The flag-ship Bellerophon six thousand tons; cost two million

five hundred thousand dollars; six hundred and fifty men; thirty-

five years old, but fitted up in complete order and is again in









             <B>PLEASANT DAYS IN BERMUDA          569</B>



fashion with rifled eight-inch guns and torpedo guns, breech-

loading.

  April 26.  Saturday.--I must make a list of officers and cit-

zens to be remembered. The courtesies extended to me, I can-

not return in kind. I may sometime be able to do something.



  A lunch here at Soncy at 2 P. M. Present: Governor and Mrs.

Newdigate, Admiral and Mrs. Watson, and the family. Very

pleasant. Calls during the rest of the afternoon. At 7:30

dined with naval officers and their wives and daughters at

Admiral Watson's. Delightful. Talk, a little music, etc. The

admiral's beautiful daughter and Trowbridge together played the

piano. Home at 10:30 P. M.

  April 27. Sunday.--Attended church at the soldiers' chapel

of Prospect Camp--well named; from it noble sea views.  A

good sermon--only ten minutes--by Rev. E. H. Goodwin.

Major Matheson, chief engineer of the islands, was our escort

among the troops, barracks, kitchens, and forts.  All interesting.

  Thence to Mrs. Whitney's--widow.  A  fine home; a lunch

of course. Thence to the widow of the American consul, Mrs.

Allen. Both fine old homes. Mr. Whitney, a loyal American.

Two flagpoles -- one for the British -- one for the American. [He]

found the American was six inches shorter than the British;

took down the British and cut off eighteen inches! A handsome

home. Dined at Mrs. Allen's. Young Allen a go-ahead, money-

making American. Turtle (land) browses around the garden--

[weighs] twenty pounds. School of fish, lovely flowers, -- a

garden of performance. A good time. These islanders retain

the virtues and manners of the slave period. Very pleasant for

strangers.

  It would be lonely to be too long where only five thousand

whites live in half a township, and that spot seven hundred miles

from other people.

  April 28.  Monday.--We drove into Hamilton and selected

a few jewels and some photographs. Returning to Soncy, we

drove to Admiral Watson's. There, a party of about forty ladies









<B>570          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and gentlemen, chiefly of the navy, on the invitation of Captains

Dowding and Atkinson, embarked in the Supply for a sail to the

Caves and to St. George's. Rowboats and steam launches were

used to get on board. We found the vessel handsomely deco-

ated with flags for awnings, and a lunch. At the head of the

lunch table was a shield with the crest and motto used by Fanny

on her note paper -- the anvil and falcon, and the motto in Latin:

"He serves his party best, etc." The trip lasted until after 6

P. M., when we returned in General Hastings' carriage from the

admiral's to Soncy after a memorable day, with all things perfect.

The party embraced almost, no, all of the navy people we have

met, the governor and Mrs. Newdigate, and several Americans,

Mrs. Roberts, of Boston, and Miss Gardiner, her sister, etc. Hot-

test during the day 71 degrees.

  April 29.  Tuesday. -- Governor Newdigate sent his carriage

and the driver took us on the shore line through Hamilton and

along its busy wharf to the south and southwest and back by the

interior road for an hour and a half from 9 A. M. A beautiful

drive.

  The best stone walls, and the most of them, in Bermuda.

  More liquor in store and more bottles unbroken and broken in

sight, with the most liquor offered, and the fewest hard drinkers

I ever saw. The "tidiest" community in the world.

  April 30. Wednesday. -- Went from my room ten steps to

the beautiful beach and had the best swim in the world with

General Hastings, Emily, and Fanny. Best of all swims.

  In the afternoon Captain Dowding, in his steam launch,

brought the coat of arms and motto exhibited at lunch on the

Supply. It was left hung up in one of the chambers at Soncy,

to remain "until one of my sons calls for it."

  May 1, 1890.  Thursday. -- We quit today this lovely, sunny

island with its delicious climate, beautiful scenery, and, more

than all, its cultivated and friendly society. Our hosts have been

simply the perfection of kinsfolk and friends.

  General and Emily with the lovely young folks, good-bye!

"May all good angels guard and keep your hearts from sorrows

forever!"









             <B>PLEASANT DAYS IN BERMUDA          571</B>



  Admiral Watson sent his steam launch to put us on board the

Orinoco. Got on board in a heavy rain but comfortably. Cap-

tains Kinahan, Drury, and Dowding called to give good-bye.

Saluted us with flags and music as we passed the fleet. On

steamer found many acquaintances. Introduced to Colonel King

and wife, of Sherbrooke, Canada.  Weather cleared off fine; a

smooth sea.

  May 3.  Saturday.--Rougher during the night--but fair

this morning. Talked at length with Rev. Father Boyle, of Cres-

son, Pennsylvania--a  Christian--on the subject of human

rights. My sort of Nihilist! A good day.

  May 4.  Sunday. -- We reached the dock about 1 P. M.  One

hour was consumed in dealing with the custom house officers and

getting off to our hotel. I paid about six dollars duties on va-

rious articles; no doubt too much. But they were very polite

and accommodating, and the mistake, if any, was in my own

statement of articles dutiable.

  May 5. Fifth Avenue Hotel. -- Today must see General Swayne

as to Captain Drury of H. M. S. Bellerophon and his due en-

tertainment in June. The courtesies and civilities shown to me

by the navy in Bermuda cannot be returned in full or in kind,

but I may do something. I must see Willam Henry Smith on the

same matter.

  The Slater trustees are Jesup, Dodge, Stewart, and Potter, of

New York, Slater, [the] Chief Justice, Colquitt, Broadus, Gil-

man, and myself (ten).  A quorum, six.  Dr. Haygood called

at 10 A. M. with W. H. Hickman of Atlanta, President of Clark

University, with whom I had a satisfactory interview on the

Slater work generally and especially on the situation at Clark,

and our experiment of a self-sustaining industrial school.

  May 6.  Tuesday.--I called on General Swayne and had a

very satisfactory interview touching civilities to be extended to

Captain Drury in June. I am to write to General Howard and

to Secretary Tracy to secure their cooperation with General

Swayne in extending courtesies to Captain Drury.

  With Dr. Haygood went down to Wall street, 45-47, United









<B>572          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



States Trust Company. The directors' room is very fine. Held

there our Slater meeting. Only three members present  But

after some hesitation I succeeded in getting at business with

Stewart, Dodge, and self, trustees; Strong, clerk, and Haygood,

general agent. Colquitt came from Washington. All went off

well. Condition of schools and funds very encouraging. Ap-

propriated about seven thousand dollars. More than ever before.

  May 8. Thursday. -- In the afternoon [yesterday] with Fran-

ces, I visited General Sherman and Carl Schurz. As we drew near

the home of General Sherman we saw men fixing flags at his

doorstep. When we reached the house it was explained that

about five hundred school children with their teachers were to

pass in review before the general.  We found the general, Miss

Mary, Mrs. Thackara and her two children (grandchildren of

General Sherman) at home. The general at once, in his cordial

way, invited me to stand with him and receive the boys or rather

see them march in military array. This was done.

  General Sherman told me of the excellent spirit of his boy,

the Catholic priest; of his cheerfulness, etc., but complained that

after he had spent thousands of dollars for his education they

[the Catholic Church] now took it all,--made him a teacher

with almost no salary and so practically confiscated him.

  [Last night], after supper at the hotel, a committee, of which

General Burnett was chairman, from the Loyal Legion, called to

escort me to the Loyal Legion banquet. General Sherman came

to my room promptly on time and we went together to the Del-

monico's. At the table I sat at the right of the commander,

General Swayne, next on my right was General Sherman, then

General Carleton, and then the venerable General Green, the old-

est soldier in the United States army--about ninety. On the

left of Commander Swayne were General S. L. Woodford, Gen-

eral Keyes, etc. A full hall, splendid banquet.

  General Woodford read a good paper on the attempts to re-

take Sumter;--the splendid heroism of Strong, Shaw, and oth-

ers. General Webb spoke. Commander Swayne's speeches were

excellent--a fine presiding officer. I made a "rattling speech,"

offhand and scattering, but it took the audience. Hardly ever









             <B>LOYAL LEGION BANQUET NEW YORK          573</B>



have I been applauded with such enthusiasm. A gratifying suc-

cess!  Home about 12:30.  General Swayne is a treasure as

commander. So much depends on a good presiding officer.

  We prepare to leave this evening. Our outing is fortunately

crowned and ended. Philadelphia, Bermuda, New York! I can-

not expect to see many--perhaps no other--such enjoyments.

Very glad Frances is with me.

  Mem.: -- I ought to have taken her to the banquet as a looker-

on from the balcony facing the commander's table. I am carrying

out with Frances the wish of Lucy. It was her desire that Fran-

ces should have the advantage of sharing with me the attentions

I am receiving.

  The Mohonk Conference is a tentative effort whose aim is to

reach the truth on the negro question and to assist in the forma-

tion of sound opinions among the people as to their duty on

the whole subject.

  May 11.  Sunday. -- "Home again" after the finest visit I ever

made, with the one sad drawback--Lucy was not with me!

General and Mrs. Hastings and their friends, the navy and army,

the civilians, officials and others, all did what was possible--and

how much was possible to them!--for our enjoyment and pleas-

ure.

  It rained furiously as I came from Cleveland yesterday--es-

pecially at Sandusky. Old Spiegel is not yet in full glory but the

grass is lovely and the trees are rapidly putting on their richest

robes. How lovely all seems this morning! But I must shed a

few "natural tears."

  May 14. Wednesday. -- I have received a paper from Hon-

orable John C. Covert, prepared by him for the Mohonk Confer-

ence. It strikes me as too exclusively political and partisan to

be useful in that body.  I write to him about it:--

  "It is masterly, considered as a paper for the press, for the

Senate, or for the general platform. Our conference, as de-

signed by its friends, is for other purposes, and its discussions,

we hope, will proceed on other lines. We assume that the negro

problem, as a political question, will be amply considered by those









<B>574          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



who on the one side and the other are charged with political ac-

tion.

  "The conference, to consist mainly of educators, philanthro-

pists, and religious teachers, must deal with the subject from a

widely different standpoint. Three questions seem to be in

point:--1.  What  is the actual condition of the negro with

respect to intelligence, morality, and religion? 2. How can

public attention be attracted to the deplorable situation? 3. What

additional aid can be given and what new agencies and methods

can be employed to uplift the negro?

  "In this work it is hoped that men of all sects and parties can

join. . . .    Political discussion in the Conference is the rock

ahead."

  May 16. Friday.--This morning, at 10 A. M., I caught up

with my deferred correspondence. Perhaps one hundred letters

written in five days. The burden will now be less. I must

now write a short talk for Mohonk on the purpose of the Negro

Conference.

  Mrs. West and Mrs. Ross came up this afternoon to talk over

their "work," trying to rescue the bad boys of the town by gath-

ering them together in good quarters "to read, to play games, to

hear good talk,"--in short, as they phrase it, "to have good

influences around them from 7 to 9 P. M." Not much that is

practical and definite in their plan. They must try individual

work. The churches can do all that is possible in this direction;

without them, little will be done.

  May 17, 1890.--Writing a few words for Mohonk Negro

Conference, I find myself using the word Christian. I am not

a subscriber to any creed. I belong to no church. But in a

sense, satisfactory to myself and believed by me to be important,

I try to be a Christian, or rather I want to be a Christian and to

help do Christian work.

  May 19. -- Webb, who came Saturday, returned to Cleveland

this morning. Before he left we hung the old mirror of Captain

Matthew Scott and his wife, which Washington used, in the

Birchard room.









             <B>ATTITUDE TOWARD RELIGION          575</B>



  There may be and probably is gross exaggeration in the

stories we hear of the "Voodoo" paganism which lurks, if

it does not prevail, among the negroes of the Black Belt in the

cotton and cane-raising districts of the South; but there is

enough of truth in the ignorance and superstition there found to

demand investigation and effort by those who believe that intelli-

gence and true religion are friendly to each other. There are

many good men who oppose National aid to education in the

South.  But are any opposed to any education for the negro?

If not, let them unite in support of what philanthropists and the

churches are doing.

  In the evening met at the Methodist Episcopal church a num-

ber of ladies and gentlemen to consider the effort of the Wo-

men's Christian Temperance Union to care for the boys of the

town. After discussion, it was ordered that a committee of five

be appointed by the chair to take charge of the whole subject,

and to take steps to secure manual training in the public schools,

day and evening, by conference with the school board and with

the Young Men's Christian Association and with the ladies of

[the] Women's Christian Temperance Union.

  May 20. Tuesday.--In the evening with Frances went to

the Grand Army hall. She easily put herself in good relations

with "the sisters," as my Lucy always called her humble friends,

with whom she was such an angel. Frances has a good deal of

her mother's divine faculty of making others happy and being

herself happy in doing it.

  May 21.  Wednesday.--Eleven months ago the stroke came

to Lucy! What a long, long tract of time I have passed since

that awful day!  But time and the good influences of a kind

Providence are healing the wound and I now meditate with a

sorrowful and tender but comforting feeling on the years I was

permitted to walk with this precious angel by my side. Blessed

memory!

  I preach no new doctrine--nothing original. It is as old as

religion, that idleness is the friend of every vice and every crime

and that industry is the mother of every virtue. Show me a

young man who by his training is habitually addicted to idle-









<B>576          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ness, and I will show you a young man against whom are en-

listed all the rational chances in life. Show me a young man

whose education has formed [him] to habits of cheerful in-

dustry, and I will show you a young man in whose favor all the

fates are marshalled and bound to fight.





             SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, May 21, 1890.

  MY DEAR AUNTY DAVIS: -- Your anxiety about my health may

be relieved entirely. I was in excellent health when I went to Ber-

muda, and the delicious climate there and its pleasures of all

good kinds did not hurt. The fact of going to Bermuda fur-

nishes more than the usual foundation for the reporter's "im-

portant if true."

  Eleven months ago today the stroke came to Lucy! Long sad

months! But time and the good influences of a kind Providence

are healing the wound and I now meditate with a sorrowful and

tender but comforting feeling on the years I was permitted to

walk with the precious angel by my side. Blessed memory --

With love to the doctor.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. E. G. DAVIS,

    Cincinnati.



             SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, May 21, 1890.

  MY DEAR MRS. HERRON:--Thanks, thanks for your letter of

welcome. Our visit and trip were every way delightful. The

weather in "the happy islands" was evenly cool--between 62

and 72 degrees -- with a bracing ocean breeze; fires every eve-

ning, and an overcoat often. Blue waters matching the blue sky,

flowers glorious, neatness, good order, hearty friendly people --

with the best traits of New England and Virginia mixed; a host

of navy and army people with nothing to do but to entertain--to

give receptions and reviews -- and evidently glad to have an ex-

cuse for doing it. I wish you could have been with us. It would

have fairly equalled the California pleasures and scenes.









             <B>TRUE FRIENDSHIP          577</B>



  Your drifting away from Helen is inevitable. There can be

no satisfactory relations between friends whose differences are

so decided and clean-cut on so many of the vitally interesting

topics. In such cases we cannot keep together if the questions

which are tabooed are many and interesting. I believe in the

friendship which Emerson describes in the finest, perhaps, of

his essays. "A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere.

Before him I may think aloud.  .  . . Almost every man we

meet requires some civility--requires to be humored; he has

some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy

in his head that is not to be questioned, and spoils all conversa-

tion with him. But a friend is a sane man who exercises not my

ingenuity but me. My friend gives me entertainment without

requiring any stipulation on my part." "I am equally balked by

antagonism and compliance." I threw in that last sentence out

of all connection, happening to see it, because it seems to me that

it hits the only danger in our relation of friendship.

  You see when I mount my hobby -- Emerson--away I am

carried. It rejoices me that you more and more see him as I

do. How he prepares one to meet the disappointments and griefs

of this mortal life. His writings, with me, seem to be religion.

They bring peace, consolation; that rest for the mind and heart

which we all long for -- content.

       . . . The breakfast bell rings.  We must take up another

essay. You say which.

               With all good wishes. Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. H. C. HERRON,

    Cincinnati.



  May 28.  Wednesday. -- [At] 7 P. M. left Spiegel Grove with

William Henry Smith on the Lake Shore. At Aunty Austin's at

10:30 P. M. in Cleveland.

  May 29. Thursday.--Mrs. Cleveland and Mrs. Huntington

with Auntie Austin. Dined with General Barnett and Myers at

the Hollenden. Met President Harrison at the train on his ar-

   37









<B>578          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



rival in Union Depot. Dined with [the] President [and] Vice-

President Morton at Mr. Eells'.

  May 30. Friday.--Rode in carriage with [the] President,

Mr. Townsend, and Mr. Eells, with procession, to the dedication

of the Garfield Monument. A great throng. Much enthusiasm

for President Harrison. A fine day--two hundred thousand

people in sight. A successful time in all respects.

  June 2.  Monday.--With Mrs. Austin to the Mohonk Con-

ference. A fine day.

  June 3.  Tuesday.  Lake Mohonk.--A good crowd.  In the

evening, with Dr. Strieby, Mr. Houghton, Lyman Abbott, [and]

President Gates, of Rutgers College, at Mr. Smiley's room, talked

over business. All harmonious. Meeting opens tomorrow.

  June 4.  Wednesday. -- Fine morning. . . .   We  met in

our conference on the negro question in the parlor of the Mohonk

Lake House. The attendance was large. Not so many from the

South as was hoped for, but enough to leaven the lump.

  Mr. A. K. Smiley opened the subject, after the usual morning

services -- Bible reading, prayer, and singing, -- with a few words

of explanation. Nominated me for president. I took the chair

after the election. Secretaries, a treasurer, and an executive com-

mittee on business and resolutions were appointed; after which

I read my inaugural, which was well received. A good meeting.

Paper read by Mr. Covert. Industrial education discussed. Mr.

[Albion W.] Tourgee and others spoke. -- Evening, a fine, hope-

ful paper by Mayo. Discussed. A good meeting.

  June 5. Thursday. -- Our best meeting so far was the morn-

ing meeting of today. The Commissioner of Education, Mr.

Harris, discussed the question of illiteracy as the cause or ac-

companiment of crime, -- showing that the illiterates furnished

largely more than their share of criminals. Rev. Lyman Abbott

made an eloquent speech. His tribute to the Hayes Administra-

tion -- "the peacemaker's Administration" -- was most heartily

applauded

  A young man from Talladega sought me out to tell of the









             <B>MOHONK NEGRO CONFERENCE          579</B>



inspiration he received from seeing Mrs. Hayes when she was

introduced to the crowd at Bennington!

  June 6. Friday. -- Mr. Woodworth, of Tougaloo University,

one of our clearest and most instructive talkers. Miss Emerson's

talk on "Homes of the Negroes" was capital. Nothing better.

  The conference meetings increase in interest. This morning

the first speech was by Albion W. Tourgee. He is an orator --

pungent,  dramatic,  original,  and  daring.     He  rebuked  the

churches, the North, the South, and stood for the negro. In a

quiet way, President White replied to him in an effective speech.

Mrs. Cheney, of Boston, spoke well, also Bishop Andrews, Gen-

eral Brinkerhoff, Mr. Glenn, of Baltimore, and others.

  Whatever may be the results of our meeting with respect to

the negro race and its destiny, [I said in substance at the

conclusion of the conference], we are in no doubt as to our feel-

ings towards Mr. and Mrs. Smiley and towards each other. We

shall always recall this lovely place with pleasure.  We  shall

never forget the hours spent here nor the acquaintances and

friendships formed here or strengthened here. Whether what

we have said or done shall live or die, our impressions, our con-

victions are stronger than before, that the much injured race in

whose behalf we have met has large possibilities -- an important

future--a part to play, in the history of our American society.

  It is said that this [race] has had no history. That is not

quite true. But true or not, we have heard enough to be assured

that the gifts required to take a place in history in large measure

belong to them. We were told of their success in weighty tables

of figures by Mr. Harris.  President White told of the great

men he met in Santo Domingo, in Hayti, and other West Indian

islands. Let me add a small item to that shining list of prophetic

facts--pointing [to] the possible future of the race. I was a

few days ago in Bermuda. The entrance to its principal port

is a long, intricate, difficult, and dangerous passage. The man

[a negro] who has charge of the ship, taking it in and out, can

be no weakling.

  June 7.  Saturday.--With Mrs. Austin left beautiful Mo-

honk about 8:30 A. M. Were heartily saluted as we left and









<B>580          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



drove on the opposite side of the lake from the hotel. Reached

Albany after noon. There Mrs. Austin took the cars for Sara-

toga, and I the Lake Shore for Cleveland.

  June  10.  Tuesday.--Today heard of the death of Carrie

Williams Little, the most intimate and prized of the school

friends of Lucy, and the wife of my friend and roommate at col-

lege, Dr. John A. Little. She died Sunday in San Francisco,

whither she had gone on account of serious sickness. A great

sufferer, and much crippled as with paralysis, her death relieves

her from a suffering life. A sound mind, a true good heart, an

excellent character, faithful always.  Lucy and I were groom

and maid at the wedding of our friends; and when I gave the

ring to Lucy, which was in my portion of the bride's cake, I

meant that I was to be hers, if she was of the same mind, or

ever became so.  She did not so understand it--but indications

were already warmly that way. So! the dear links that hold

me to the paradise of my life are parting one by one. I am

ready to go.

  June 11. Wednesday.--Finished substantially the arrears of

my correspondence. I am now to prepare two speeches -- one for

Ottawa [Kansas], to the soldiers, one for the ladies of the Wo-

man's Home Missionary Society at Topeka. The topic of the

first, "The Nation's Debt to its Defenders." The other, "The

Home Missions Work." Couple it with home education or in-

dustrial education.

  [Delaware], June 17. -- Joined by Judge Lawrence [yesterday]

en route to Delaware to attend the meeting of trustees of Wes-

leyan. A hearty welcome by President Bashford and family.

In the evening heard Bennett, of Evanston, deliver a good ad-

dress. The most important question [before the trustees] is as

to building the college building--a chapel, drill hall, recitation

rooms, etc., etc. Not quite enough subscribed, I think, to justify

going on, but we will no doubt try it and can ultimately push it

through.

  June 18. Wednesday.--Visited the spring each morning be-

fore 6 A. M. This morning I also went to the cemetery where









             <B>GRANT'S JUDGMENT OF HAYES          581</B>



father and mother are buried.  It is improving.       "Lorenzo

Berchard" is one of the names on our monument. All else well

enough.

  Attended the funeral of Carrie Little yesterday afternoon.

Tea with President Merrick, Judge Lawrence, Dr. Trimble, and

General Godman. The three aged trustees are worth noticing.

All past eighty and on the board almost fifty years.

  June 19.  Thursday.--D. S. Van Slyke writes me to know

if I have become a convert to Nationalism (Los Angeles). I

reply: --

  "(Confidential.)  I agree with you as to the evil, as to the

urgent necessity for a remedy, as to the importance of investiga-

tion; and as to the general fact, I hope, that all intelligent and

earnest agitation of the subject tends to good. No further."

  Professor McCabe, at Delaware, told me this: Lieutenant

Clarence Sharpe of the army was with General Grant when the

dispatch came that General Hayes was nominated for President.

The general was smoking. Between puffs, he said: "General

Hayes is a steady man -- yes, he is a steady man. He will do."



              SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, July 19, 1890.

  MY DEAR MRS. FREMONT:--Your noble husband was very

dear to me and to this town.  He  was especially admired

throughout our country for what he was and for what he did.

I deeply sympathize with you.

                       Very sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. JESSIE BENTON FREMONT,

    New York.

  June 22. Sunday. -- When the Government paid seven-thirty

interest in gold, it was not called charity. It was keeping faith

with the nation's creditors.

  Somebody has started a paragraph in the newspapers that I

am a millionaire. There is nothing in it. It should read: "Gen-

eral Hayes is not a man of large wealth. He is in comfortable

circumstances; his boys are all earning their own living. He may









<B>582          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



be worth fifteen or twenty per cent of the amount the effusive

reporter has given him."



            SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, June 22, 1890.

  MY DEAR AUNTY DAVIS:--Your letter about the book was

sent to Webb. He has just returned it. You know I have com-

mittals and arrangements which prevent me from taking part

in such an enterprise as the one you suggest. It is possible that

hereafter I may be free to act, but at present it is as I thought

you understood. There is nothing that I can make public. Of

course, an "In Memoriam," such as I suppose was in your

thought, or rather in the contemplation of the society, is not in

the way of anything I have in mind. Very likely, the time may

come when I can throw open all the sources of information,

but at present I am complicated, as I intended to suggest to you

when we last met. I hope your memorial will be confined to

the scope suggested by Mrs. Hickman on page 16 of the eighth

annual report of your society.

  The Mohonk meeting was very interesting. I will see that

you have an invitation to the next one also.

           With regards to the doctor. Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. ELIZA G. DAVIS,

    Cincinnati.



  [Columbus], June 24.  Tuesday. -- Met yesterday with God-

frey, Wing, Dr. Schueller, Miller, and Massie, trustees, and

President Scott and Secretary Cope.

  Only difference [was] on honorary degrees to four gentlemen.

I opposed to the practice. No objection to the men honored.

  In the evening at the High Street Congregational Church.

Baker, of Cincinnati, made an offhand, so-so speech. Governor

Campbell was humorous. But through his remarks ran a vein,

wise and sagacious and full of hope. I was called out. De-

clined with a humorous reference to the heat.

  Today met "same as before." Our honorary degrees prob-

ably illegal. Referred to attorney-general. Routine business.









             <B>ADDRESS AT OTTAWA, KANSAS          583</B>



  Death of Judge McCrary, Secretary of War in my Cabinet

[announced]. Sent condolence to family.

 June 25.  Wednesday. -- One year ago this morning my dar-

ling went to her rest! An "empty" year, as old Mr. Lyman

Beecher said of his great loss! I go tonight to Chicago.

  June 26. Thursday.--Arrived at Chicago 7:30 A. M. Met

at the station with carriage by my friend Colonel H. C. Corbin.

Drove to his house and took breakfast with Mrs. Corbin and

the young folks.

  Drove north with Colonel Corbin to the north end of Lincoln

Park. Saw the fine statue of Lincoln, the Indian group, etc.

  Called on Mrs. Jewett. An agreeable meeting. Her father,

Judge Roundtree, on his death bed in Wisconsin, age eighty-five.

  June 29.  Sunday. -- Left Chicago Thursday night in a special

car, alone. At Kansas City, Friday morning, joined by General

Devol and others and soon en route to Ottawa.

  [There] Governor George T. Anthony and others received

me.  A good lunch (no, breakfast) about 11 A. M.  A great

crowd in the beautiful park. The Chautauqua Assembly an at-

tractive affair. Here met General Alger [and] General Mc-

Cook (Alexander McD.). Both gentlemen and others spoke.

In the afternoon I spoke in the fine spacious auditorium for

an hour to a monster assembly. Hot but very agreeable. A

sympathetic and alive body of soldiers.

  In the evening bid good-bye to these friendly people.

  A fine tribute to Lucy! The whole audience rose in silence,

[and] stood a minute; voted a floral offering to me in honor

of her. -- Some thousands, men and women, shook hands with

me.

  Train to Kansas City, Governor Alger with me. Met at Kan-

sas City old comrades, Colonel Tomlinson, Captain Sperry, and

others.

  Reached Chicago yesterday at 11 A. M. Met by Colonel Cor-

bin. In old room on parlor floor at Grand Pacific. Dined with

Webb, Drake, General Alger, William Henry [Smith], and

Colonel Corbin. Reached Toledo, Birchard's, at eleven last

night. Home this evening.









<B>584          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  July 1. Tuesday.--Worked hard all of the hot afternoon,

arranging papers, etc., etc., long neglected. It is easy for me

to work effectively when I perspire copiously, no matter how hot

it is. I think of myself in such cases as a salamander.

  July 3.  Thursday. -- Nine years ago yesterday Garfield was

shot by the assassin.

  One of the fortunate facts in my career is that I never had

an overweening fondness for political life. My ambition for

station was always easily controlled.  If the place came to me

it was welcome. But it never seemed to me worth seeking at

the cost of self-respect, of independence. My family were not

historic; they were well-to-do, did not hold or seek office. It

was easy for me to be contented in private life. An honor was

no honor to me, if obtained by my own seeking.

  I am to speak at a pioneer meeting in Delaware the 25th.

I will take the book about Ephraim Cutler. This as a text on

pioneers.  Who are pioneers?  Read the life and adventures of

Ephraim Cutler. I am not old enough to be a pioneer of Dela-

ware. I am an early settler, an old settler. I settled here in

1822, October the fourth; not an old settler that morning--a

newcomer.

  Two friendly comments recently pleased me: "You were the

most independent and least partisan of the Presidents elected

by a party." "You left your party stronger, and the country

more prosperous than any, except a very few of your predeces-

sors. Not more probably than two or three were equally

fortunate in this respect."

  July 4, 1890. Friday. -- Independence Day. Read Depew's

fine speech at Chicago on the Columbus quadricentennial.

  "Our national anthem?" Which? "Hail Columbia," "Star-

spangled Banner," or "America"?

  A cool and delightful breeze all day, this Fourth of July! In

the afternoon drove with Mrs. Bristol, Miss Avery [of Cleveland,

visiting here], and Webb to the furniture works to see as to

the old sideboard sent by Uncle Austin Birchard to Cousin

Charlotte at Elyria, Ohio; taken by her, after the death of her









             <B>ATTITUDE 'OWARD OFFICE-SEEKING          585</B>



husband, back to Vermont, and by her sent again to Ohio to

me.

  July 5. Saturday.--I read that General Cochran yesterday,

at the meeting of the Society of the Cincinnati, proposed a sus-

pension of the rules to elect Rutherford B. Hayes an honorary

member. There was objection. It was stated that he was

already an honorary member of the State Society of Penn-

sylvania, and the matter was dropped.

  I would certainly appreciate the honor. My friend General

Cochran should perhaps have ascertained in advance as to the

disposition of those present. But it was an act of friendship, and

I must not criticize the manner of it. Thanks, General.

  July 6. Sunday.--Lucy was a little above the average size

of American women, both in height and weight, viz., height,

five feet four and one-half inches; weight one hundred and

forty-five [pounds], probably. This in her prime--age forty

to forty-five.  Her finest picture is the photograph by Sarony in

May 1877 when she was forty-five. She had been then the

mother of eight children, and her two eldest were both voters --

past twenty-one.

  Read to Miss Avery the last volume of Howells, "The

Shadow of a Dream." It is certainly one of his best. It fully

sustains -- will enhance -- his reputation.

  Reading also to myself George Alfred Townsend's "Mrs.

Reynolds and Alexander Hamilton." Some good pictures of

that interesting period in our history.

  July 7. Monday. -- Finished reading "Ephraim Cutler" [and]

"Mrs. Reynolds and Alexander Hamilton" and began Butter-

field's last book, "The Girtys."

  The Nationalist for July has a favorable notice of me under

the head, "The Function of an ex-President."

  Our village tempest over the census does seem to develop

neglect in one ward, but not enough to help us out. In 1880

in Ohio there were less than four and one-half people to one

voter; to be exact 4.410 and a fraction, but call it four and one-

half. The vote in Fremont was in 1888 fifteen hundred and









<B>586          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



thirty-eight. This would give a population of 6,867 in Fremont

in 1888 by the vote for President in that year.

  The people who get up directories are responsible for the

extravagant estimates of population in advance of the census,

and for the disappointment since. Compare the present popula-

tion with what is given in the directories, and their exaggera-

tion everywhere will be apparent. If this is not conclusive, com-

pare the vote of the cities with the results of the census and be

informed.

  July 10.  Thursday. -- General Kirby, of Upper Sandusky, is

here today to investigate the complaints of the census, he being

in charge of this census district. I spent a few minutes with

him and the census men at his room in the Ball House. While

I was present every name claimed to be omitted was found duly

enumerated! The town has not grown as much as we supposed.

The census of 1880 was badly stuffed. And the growth of the

town is largely in suburbs which have not yet been annexed.

Our mistake has been in not annexing.

  I drove with General Kirby around the town and brought him

up to Spiegel.

  July 11. Friday.--"Men have invented a thousand ways of

producing wealth but not one for properly distributing it." I

don't know where the trouble is. If we once knew the trouble,

somebody would find the cure.

  July 12. Saturday. -- During some days I have been chiefly

employed in securing a good jail. The new one will be after a

good model -- the Pickaway County jail. I succeeded in getting

the county officers and Horace Buckland, appointed by the court,

to postpone decision until the Board of State Charities were

consulted. General R. Brinkerhoff, chairman of the Board of

Charities, came yesterday. I conferred with him and the archi-

tect, Johnson. Today the whole affair seems agreed on.

  Just received a dispatch from General Grosvenor saying, "I

have offered resolution to make you Manager of Soldiers'

Homes.  Desire comes from soldiers.  Do not decline."

  Long since I resolved to decline all offices of honor or profit









             <B>MODEL JAIL FOR FREMONT          587</B>



under Government. I am sorry he has offered it. I send these

words: --

  GENERAL C. H. GROSVENOR,

    Washington, D. C.

  I appreciate your friendship in this affair. But I have not

time to serve if appointed. Please withdraw my name at once.

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  July 13. Sunday. -- Read Parton's "Jefferson" on the ques-

tion of his share in the famous antislavery clause in the Ordi-

nance of 1787. It does not seem to be of [any sort]. He was

not a Member of Congress at the time the ordinance was under

consideration. He was in France. His ordinance of 1784 which

did not pass is a totally different affair. In some of its leading

features, e. g., in its division of the territory into ten States

with absurd names, it was frivolous, and on slavery it expressly

authorized it until 1800.  Once introduced, fastened to the soil,

it would have required a conflict to get rid of it; with what re-

sult, we may conjecture. Even with the express prohibition,

there was a doubtful conflict in Indiana and Illinois.

  July 15, 1890. -- Wrote and read as usual. "The Girtys," by

Butterfield, is a book of our local history; rather dismal. The

Girtys were the horror and dread of the pioneers--a bad lot.

They ought to be disposed of in a few sentences, not given a

book. Butterfield, the author, spends many words showing, or

rather asserting, the mistakes of Roosevelt and others.

  July 16.  Wednesday.--Grass and lawn never finer at this

season. With summer half gone the flowers and verdure are

springlike. . . . Two good women with a half a dozen or

more orphans from the Home for Soldiers' and Sailors'

Orphans at Xenia called, and were regaled with lemonade and

cake.

  Callers out of curiosity seem on the increase.       Probably

caused by the season for leisure travel.

  July 17.  Thursday.--I have today been turning over my

old scrap-books looking for items about the days of the old









<B>588          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



 pioneers. I find a good deal on the topic I was looking into,

but more on other points that interests me. I was delighted to

come upon pleasant sketches of Lucy. How they thrilled me!

 I find one of my best little speeches was a five-minute talk,

full of quotations from Emerson, in welcome of the Sangerbund

at Music Hall in Cincinnati when I was governor [in] 1870.

As good a talk as any for the occasion was the speech at the

unveiling of our soldiers' monument in 1885 in Fort Stephenson

Park. In one talk I find our two perils--perils both of old-

world origin -- lawlessness, tending to anarchy, and caste, based

on plutocracy, tending to despotism, well expressed.

  July 18. Friday. -- Examined for pioneer items two more

volumes of scrap-books. Found the scrap showing how Godkin

in the Nation advised that some Hayes elector should so cast

his vote as to prevent an election. This would result in the

election of Tilden by the House.       [Godkin] charged by the

Tribune with advising Lowell so to vote.  Godkin denies it.

The Tribune produces the article and other articles by General

Sickles, Bryant, etc.

  A lovely, cool summer day. Drove in the evening. Saw the

new moon; talked of the planets. Why do not the schools teach

enough astronomy to turn out scholars with some ideas of it?

  July 19. Saturday. -- Spent the first part of the forenoon in

considering the alarming amount of shortage found [in the bank]

each month for about twenty-nine months past, on an average

of ten days in each month -- aggregating about four thousand

dollars excess of shortage over overplus! My interest in the

bank is small--only five thousand dollars or less.  It must  be

crime. Carelesness or accident would hardly run so. It is over

one hundred and thirty dollars per month. I suggested a list

of the former two years; also a list of persons employed in the

bank. No one is suspected. But it must be thoroughly in-

vestigated. I never heard of it until yesterday. My own in-

terest is small but as a director I must see into it









             <B>MRS. HAYES'S DISTINCTIVE QUALITY          589</B>



                            SPIEGEL GROVE, July 19, 1890.

  MY FRIEND:--I mourn with you [the fire in the Associated

Press offices]. Money will build again, and better, but your

[manuscript] treasures! Can it be that they are gone? You

will bear it like a hero. I shall still hope that worse than the

worst has been told.

                      Ever sincerely,

                                  RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH

    New York.



  July 23. Wednesday. -- More than forty years ago I met at

the Sulphur Spring in Delaware one who was permitted while

she lived, by a gracious Providence, to be the good angel of my

life. This much may I not say of her? She had rare ad-

vantages of features and manners. But with her mind and

heart and soul, the homeliest face would have been radiantly

beautiful. Emerson says: "There is no beautifier of complexion,

or form, or behaviour like the wish to scatter joy and not pain

around us." That gift, that charm belonging to her was so

transcendent that it must be immortal.



                                   SPIEGEL, July 23, 1890.

  MY FRIEND:--You are a philosopher. I wrote you a short

note addressed to you at New York on hearing how you had

suffered. It is too bad. I am more disturbed about it than you

seem to be.  It colors my sky.  The days are clouded. . . .

  My things here are more secure than you think. This room,

my den, has fireproof floor above and below it. Things can

in almost any case be hustled out before a fire could destroy

them. But I will think of it.

  My kindest regards to Mrs. Smith.

                         Sincerely,

                                  RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

    Lake Forest, Illinois.









<B>590          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  July 27.  Sunday. -- Thursday via Toledo, where I spent the

day, to Delaware. Entertained at pleasant home of Chauncey

Hills, whose wife was Margaret Williams, an older sister of

Carrie Little, Lucy's nearest friend from her school-days in

Delaware. He has six sons. I think all grown; several mar-

ried and quite a list of grandchildren.  A noble family.

Friday, 25th, Judge Jones called early. He is [as] bright and

sparkling as ever. He took me in his buggy to see Mrs. Sophia

Wasson White. The doctor is quitting practice as fast as he can

and they live very quietly in their pleasant home on the old

place of her father across the street. She says my father died

in the same house where I was born, on William Street. We

(Judge Jones and I)  . . . drove around town and finally

reached the [pioneer meeting] stand about one hundred and

fifty yards west of the spring on the main east and west walk.

President Merrick opened with prayer. Judge McElroy assisted

Colonel Van Deman, president of the society, and Chauncey

Hills, as secretary, in the business of the society. Rev. Ben-

jamin W. Childlaw, General John C. Lee, and myself were an-

nounced as the speakers after the basket lunch.

  Met and shook hands with many old settlers. Sam Rheem,

who lived with us and loved me as a child of three, is now ninety

years old. He looks natural and well. I recognized him readily.

His mind is somewhat affected by time. He is "losing his wits,"

as Emerson once told me he was (1877). He asked me if [I]

belonged to the church, and on my reply in the negative, asked,

"Why don't you join?"  Judge Jones said his action was strange

in 1876. His reason was, "Rutherford is too good a man; they

will murder him. I won't vote his life away."

  After lunch, music [and] entertaining and appropriate

speeches; first by Rev. B. W. Childlaw and General Lee. I

then spoke at some length, apparently acceptably. The audience

grew so that when I closed there was a very large gathering

of old people and others. In the evening a reception at Mr.

Hills' was well attended. Many old friends and the sons and

grandsons and daughters and granddaughters of old friends

were present. . . .

  I find that before the organization of Augusta County, Virginia,









             <B>PIONEER MEETING AT DELAWARE          591</B>



in 1738, the western boundary of the new counties in the western

part of the State extended westward only to the passes or crest

of the mountains; that is, as far as settlements had gone and the

mountain range beyond them. But the grant of the English king

extended from the Atlantic coast "for two hundred miles north

and south from Point Comfort and up into the land throughout,

from sea to sea, west and northwest."  It is true this charter

of 1609 was annulled upon a writ of quo warranto in 1624; but

Virginia still claimed the territory and in 1738, in creating

Augusta County, first extended a county to the western limits

of Virginia, thus including the whole of the old Northwest

Territory in the new county of Augusta.  Afterwards, in 1769,

Botetourt County was created out of Augusta and included the

Northwest Territory. Delaware therefore was first in Augusta

County, Virginia, and afterwards in Botetourt.

  August 1, 1890. Friday. -- Some one said to Simon Cameron:

"Your son Don has had fine advantages." "Yes," responded the

wise old man, "he has had more than his father, but there is

one supreme advantage that he has never enjoyed -- the stimulus

of poverty and hardship."

  I suspect that the best book[s] of a religious sort lately are:

"Jesus of Nazareth," by John A. Broadus, [and] "The Man of

Galilee," by Atticus G. Haygood.

  August 7. Thursday.--An agreeable household today.  Wil-

liam Henry Smith, Walter Sherman, Mary, Birch, the boy,

nurse, and our usual family. Friend Smith began to read up

in my scrap-books and papers for a sketch, perhaps a biography

of Lucy. With about one hundred and thirty or forty scrap-

books, and perhaps two or three thousand letters to go over the

work is at the threshold rather appalling.





                                   FREMONT, August 7, 1890.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your letter of the second instant is before

me. It seems to me probable that if I were actively engaged in

business, and on the spot, I would go into the enterprise as you

have done. I will not therefore criticize it. It is perhaps enough









<B>592          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



simply to say, that if my property is increased in value, I do

not wish nor expect it to be done without bearing my share of

the expense either in land or cash. We shall have no disagree-

ment on that point. Not having been consulted on the ways and

means adopted, I may be reasonably excused for awaiting results,

or at least full information as to the situation, before advancing

  With thanks for your attention in sending interesting docu-

ments relating to the business, I am with great respect,

                          Sincerely,

  HON. CLINTON MARKELL.





  August 10.  Sunday. -- The strike on the New York Central.

Depew in Europe. Cause, the discharge of men because they

belong to the Knights of Labor. The need for government pro-

tection involves the need of government control of railways.

Protection of unwise and unjust management will never do.

  Afternoon, drove to the cemetery. No room for trees--I

mean, more trees--on my lot. I will plant only the mountain

holly from Admiral Ammen's place in Maryland.  The brave

old admiral prepared the trees by taking them from the forest,

pruning them severely, and replanting and rerooting them on his

own grounds.

  August 11. Monday. -- I must prepare to go to visit in

camp Webb and the Cleveland Troop and the artillery in the

grove near Huron, Sage's Grove. No wonder that in all time

the true soldier has inspired the best poetry, the finest fiction,

the finest history, and biography. Who is the true soldier? The

Bayard, the Philip Sidney, the Nelson, the Shaw of Fort Wag-

ner, the Lowell who died at Cedar Creek, McPherson at At-

lanta.  And nearer home we find one who left us only today,

George Crook. Always amiable, unselfish, thoughtful of others,

friendly with all, sincere and truthful, brave-hearted in battle.

A favorite -- the final test -- most admired and best loved always

by good women, is the truly ideal soldier. Wars will remain









             <B>THE IDEAL SOLDIER          593</B>



while human nature remains. I believe in my soul in co-

operation, in arbitration; but the soldier's occupation we cannot

say is gone until human nature is gone.

  August 14.  Thursday.--Home again after a pleasant visit

to Camp Hawkins, or rather to Webb and his favorite troop,

the First Cleveland Troop, camped in Sage's Grove, about two

miles east of Huron. With them are the companies of the First

Regiment of Artillery under Colonel Smithknight. Captain Gar-

retson commands the troop, an excellent officer, with Lieutenant

Myers first. Webb is much praised for energy and ability, is

indeed the man of all work in the troop; a fine horseman, a

splendid quartermaster, etc. . . . Camp life all came back

to me as it was twenty-nine years ago. Alas, Lucy could not

be with me to enjoy it! Drills, reviews, songs, "the sounds and

sights" of the camp once so dear to me. Two days of over-

flowing feelings--Crook, Comly, Lucy, Hastings, and the rest!

My old comrade Hawkins as adjutant-general was the ranking

officer of the camp. Webb in the charging was at the head of

the troop.





                                  SPIEGEL, August 15, 1890.

  MY DEAR AUNTY: -- It delights me to hear that your "In Me-

moriam" is as it is. . . . I will be particularly pleased to see the

young portrait (sixteen years of age) of Lucy in your volume.

For the other there are two.  I now prefer the narrow face. In

the affair of the Wesleyan "Memoriam," I chose the broader

face. It is good but not, I now think, the best. I send you a

specimen of the one I like best.  Of course, you will select your

own preference. . . .

  Yes, you dear woman, we never make enough of those we

love until it is too late!

                   Ever yours, sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S.--My regards to the doctor. We (Fanny and I), will

hope to come for a week, the last week in September. We

  38









<B>594          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



probably must go to the hotel--at least the first half of our

stay. We go from Cincinnati direct to New York. -- H.

  MRS. E. G. DAVIS,

     Cincinnati.



  August 18.--It is more often mentioned as time passes that

"Hayes is one of the few Presidents -- perhaps the only one --

whose Administration left his party stronger than it found it."

  Again it is noticed that "Hayes is the only President who

adhered in practice to his principles on the subject of one term."

Not unpleasant reading.

  August 19. Tuesday. -- To Napoleon. Reached there from

Toledo in forty-five minutes -- fast going -- and received by the

mayor and county officials, and by Mr. Justin H. Tyler, the lead-

ing lawyer of the county, Judge Haag, and others of both parties,

and taken to the good hotel of Mr. Blair. In the evening I met

many citizens of Napoleon of all parties.

  August 20.  Wednesday. -- The glad rain of yesterday cleared

the air and freshened all nature. I drove in the morning with

young Mr. Tyler up the river, east side; again down the river;

a lovely valley. About noon went to the fair ground. Dined

with the ladies of Napoleon. Nothing better done anywhere.

  The meeting of pioneers and others was large. General Lee

spoke first. I closed with a rather singular enumeration of

the organized counties and States in which the territory now

embraced in Henry County was at different times included; the

men inhabiting the counties and the names of the counties

founding Henry, and the characters they were named after.

  In the evening with Lee to Toledo and his home for the night

on Ashland Avenue.

  August 24. Sunday.--I found a letter of Dr. Franklin to a

minister in New Jersey--liberal in tone, full of charity, pre-

ferring works to worship--copied in full by Uncle Birchard.

I read it this morning to Scott who is still in bed. He was sur-

prised to find a man so liberal in the time of Franklin.









             <B>REUNION OF TWENTY-THIRD 1890          595</B>



  For a week or more I have been dizzy; at times would stag-

ger. Dr. Hilbish says the heart is strong and sound, that the

difficulty is stomach dizziness. This may all be correct, it prob-

ably is; but it may be otherwise. Well, let the end come. The

charm of life left me when Lucy died. I believe in the moral

government of the universe. I trust and have faith in the power,

wisdom, and goodness of the Divine Eternal. Death must be

good for its victims. The living left behind must grieve, and

for a time seem to lose. But for those who depart the transi-

tion must be good and cannot be bad. What is universal, what

is allotted to all of God's highest creatures, is surely to promote

their welfare and happiness.  It is not [to] be feared--to be

approached with dread.

  Emerson says:--"What am I?  What has my will done to

make me what I am? Nothing."

  August 25. Monday.--At Port Clinton [en route to Lake-

side], met an officer or soldier of the Seventh Regiment, H. G.

Orton, now [of] Princeton, Missouri. He said he could not fail

to take my hand; that he introduced himself; that twenty-eight

years ago he was very happy to see me; never gladder to see

anybody than me at Carnifax, September 10, 1862, when I

rescued the prisoners of the Seventh who were in the shanties

wounded, etc., etc.

  I reached Lakeside about 7:30 P. M., and was warmly wel-

comed by Major Bottsford and others who took my baggage and

we tramped merrily to the hotel.

 August 26. Tuesday.--A good attendance of the comrades

[at the Twenty-third Reunion]. Many wives and daughters--

all happy, sympathetic, friendly. P. M. over to Kelly Island.

It rained (as usual on that trip) but we had a jovial party. In

the evening I made a talk on Fremont, Schenck, and Crook, our

old commanders, who had died during the last year. What a

favorite Crook is with all who served under him!

  August 27.  Wednesday.--Clear and cool.  A  large atten-

dance. Perhaps, as often happens, our last reunion is the best.

    The touching incident of the day was the presentation









<B>596          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to me by Captain Ellen, in behalf of the regiment, of a hand-

somely framed testimonial to Mrs. Hayes. I replied in tears.

  August 28.  Thursday.--In  the afternoon on  steamer  to

Cedar Point; thence in carriage to the Soldiers' Home. Tea

with General Force. Mrs. Horton [General Force's mother-in-

law], a cheerful old lady (eighty-five), very deaf but interesting

with her fine manners; Miss Pope, an interesting girl, who played

good "tunes" on the piano; Horton [and] young Pope. The

general (Pope) [brother-in-law of Mrs. Force] seems of sound

mind but he is badly paralyzed. Death is preferable. Oh, how

grateful I am that Lucy passed away so beautifully! -- Reached

Cleveland and 891 Prospect about 10:20 P. M.

  August 29.  Friday.--Met Dr. Haydn at his house.  Talked

over the Medical College trouble. Decided in my own mind to

report in favor of "the university idea" in firm, decided terms,

with a few courteous words for the medical faculty to assure

them of all consideration for their wishes consistent with the

true university.

  P. M. Meeting of trustees; elected Dr. Thwing the new presi-

dent. A fit man, "all around man," if the accounts given by all

are correct. I hope he will accept. I spoke of declining by

reason of other duties. Mr. Mather very earnestly requested

me to remain; promised to overlook absences, etc.

  September 1. Monday. -- It is so easy to say no in a letter in

reply to a letter, that the average man is tempted to do it. In

all important cases face to face is the way to win.

  Our last reunion at Lakeside, Bottsford says, is our best. It

seems perfect of its kind.

  If I were called on to justify the eulogy of my friend Aaron

F. Perry, could I do it better than to say this (Mem.:--He said

it [my Administration] was "unique in its excellencies")?--

  1. Hayes never sought the Presidency, nor any other office.

2. He announced himself in favor of one term on principle,

and having been elected, adhered to his convictions on this point.

3. He left his country at the close of his Administration in far

better condition than he found it at the beginning of his term.

4. His party, at the beginning of his term, was weak and out









             <B>MERITS OF ADMINISTRATION          597</B>



of power in the House, the Senate, and with the Executive in

dispute. At the end of his term, all branches of the Government

were strongly held by his party.

  Of what other President can this be said? Of how many

Presidents can it be said that they were equally fortunate?

  September 2.  Tuesday.--On  Lucy's birthday anniversary,

Miss Kate S. Dalton of Fremont (August 28) read an excellent

paper. She is mistaken in one statement. She says: "By her

love for humanity, her unaffected simplicity, and the simple

power of goodness alone, she commands an enthusiasm that has

never been given to the most splendid achievements." All that

can be said of her goodness is true. But goodness alone would

not have authorized Miss Dalton to say, "she stands without a

peer." Her gifts, her powers, her talents in dealing with all

men and women, with all of God's creatures, were so great, that

to speak of her as a woman of genius does not seem extravagant

to those who knew her intimately. It was the union in her of

intellectual gifts and goodness, both in an extraordinary degree,

that made her the woman she was. Charms of face and person

must be added also.

  I count one hundred and thirty-five volumes of scrap-books

kept from time to time during the last thirty or forty years;

chiefly during my Administration at Washington.

  September 4.  Thursday.--In the evening I heard from Mr.

Keeler that today in the post-office at Cincinnati my companion,

comrade, and friend, General Edward F. Noyes, died suddenly.

No particulars. General Noyes was associated with me in many

important things.  He was a member of the Literary Club in

Cincinnati during a large part of the period of my membership;

a member of the bar with me in Cincinnati; an active and elo-

quent young Republican with me.  One of the soldiers of the

Burnet Rifles of which I was first captain. He went into the

war in the Thirty-ninth Ohio; was awfully wounded.  He suc-

ceeded me as governor of Ohio. He made the admirable and

effective speech nominating me for President at the Cincinnati

Convention. He, as a lawyer, represented me in Florida and

ably did his part in securing the vote of that State in the close









<B>598          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



contest of 1876. He was appointed by me, without hint or sug-

gestion from him, Minister to France where he with signal

ability represented the Nation during my term.

  One of the most affecting and effective war stories I ever

heard was told by him on my urgent suggestion, before the Ohio

Commandery of the Loyal Legion, viz., his experience when

wounded. His story of the event was thrilling. His coming home;

carried in an express wagon to the Wright residence on Elm

Street; helped out by chance bystanders; and the cutting off his

leg again and again to prevent death by mortification.  His saying:

"Doctor, if you cut it off again, let it be just below my chin."

Comrade, friend, hail and farewell!  I envy him his sudden

death, if it was without delay or pain. I will attend the funeral.

  September 6. Saturday. -- To Cincinnati to attend the funeral

of General Noyes. On the train from Toledo down were a

number of agreeable men. General John W. Fuller, a division

commander of General Noyes when he was wounded, is intelli-

gent and entertaining. He was going to attend the funeral.

Townsend, of Lima, and his uncle from Malone, New  York,

were also on the train. He spoke of a new book on the labor

and capital question by a man now in New York. He had

ordered it sent to me. We reached Cincinnati at 6 P. M. At

the Burnet House met General Force, Colonel Neil, Captain

Ewing, etc. In the evening called on Mrs. Davis. The doctor

and she are as usual. The "In Memoriam" of Lucy not yet

ready; a month or more before it will appear. No one at Her-

ron's; left my card.

  September 7. Sunday. -- Called on Mrs. Noyes with Generals

Fuller [and] Force, Colonel Neil, etc. She bore up well. No

premonition, beyond the general feeling of the general that he

would go suddenly.

  September 9. Tuesday.- This evening attended, on the urgent

request of Father Bauer, a banquet at Opera Hall to the State

Council of the Catholic Knights of America. Very agreeable.

Met Pater, of Hamilton, President State Council, and many

other intelligent laymen and a number of priests.  My  speech,

humorous, offhand, and in recognition of Catholic friends in









             <B>DEATH OF GENERAL NOYES          599</B>



the war--Rosecrans, Scammon, etc. -- was exceedingly well re-

ceived.

  September  11.  Thursday.--Since  my  speech before the

Catholic Knights I have thought of a better one. The bones of

it are: I am a Protestant, born a Protestant, expect to live a

Protestant, and shall probably die a Protestant. I can see in

the past and today faults in the Catholic Church, but I am grate-

ful for: -1.  Its work in behalf of temperance.  2.  Its ex-

ample in keeping together poor and rich, [its] care for the poor,

[its] influence with the poor.  3.  For its treatment of the

blacks--of all the unfortunate races.  A negro sat with us at

our banquet table.  4.  For its fidelity in spite of party; nine-

teen out of twenty were against Lincoln, but Archbishop Pur-

cell strung the American flag, in the crisis of our fate, from the

top of the Cathedral in Cincinnati, April 15, 1861.  The spire

was beautiful before; but the Catholic prelate made it radiant

with hope and glory for our country.



                                 SPIEGEL, September 11, 1890.

  MY FRIEND:--I am glad you are again sound enough for

the hard work you are always piling upon yourself, and that

good tidings reaches you from Mrs. Smith.

  I send you another copy of Miss Kate S. Dalton's good article

about Mrs. Hayes. She is a hard-working school-teacher of

this town --retiring and unknown outside of a narrow circle--

of undoubted talents.

                       With best wishes,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- I go to West Virginia reunion next week at Parkers-

burg; to National Prison Congress, Cincinnati, the week after;

and the following week Peabody in New York; 13th and 16th

[of] October, Indianapolis and St. Louis, Loyal Legion. -- H.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



  September  12.  Friday. -- Busy  all  day  with  preparing

speeches for Prison Congress at Cincinnati and for Parkersburg









<B>600          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



reunion of the Army of West Virginia. For exercise trimmed

the large hemlock near front entrance and other trees. Called

on Dudrow as to organizing the Fremont Improvement Society

after the model of Stockbridge.

  The vertigo was more frequent and troublesome than usual

today. What it may mean, I am not confident. Much or little,

is the question. In either event I am content. Death must in

the long run be good. My children now all have fixed characters

and do not need me. They will lead, I am sure, reputable lives;

be useful and happy.

  September 16. Tuesday. -- To Parkersburg. Met by William

Bentley, son of General Bentley; taken to residence of Mr. and

Mrs. Bentley. All very agreeable. About 11 drove out to the

"Big Tent." Very beautifully decorated. A lovely camp. The

rain passed away.     Afternoon and  evening very successful.

Gibson on hand, also good singing.  This makes us safe.  Good

bands and drum corps.

  September  17.  Wednesday.--Procession.        General Kelley

and wife, Governor Fleming, General Powell, Duval, Devol,

Bottsford and wife, Major Skinner, and a host of the better

brethren. Made a successful speech. A great throng. In the

evening bid goodbye to our excellent hosts. To Warren House,

Athens.

  September 18.  Thursday. -- To Columbus.  With Governor

Campbell to State Fair. Mayor Bruck introduced me with pleas-

ant words about my "pure and wise Administration." I intro-

duced Governor Rusk, of Wisconsin, the Secretary of Agricul-

ture. He also was kindly. He said of me, "as a citizen who

stands higher in the hearts of the people than any other man

living." Words of abuse have turned to praise in my case very

largely. This is agreeable.

  P. M. Rode back to the city with the agreeable governor,

and in the evening called on the Fullertons.

  September 19. Friday. -- In Edward Taylor's office signed

bond and affidavit--justified for two hundred and fifty thou-

sand dollars in unincumbered real estate. At 10:30 [off] for









             <B>PEABODY BOARD MEETING          601</B>



Toledo. General Jones, of Delaware, on train and had a most

entertaining time with him. Reached Toledo about 3:30 P. M.

Went out to Birchard's, found all well.

  October 8. Wednesday. -- Home again direct from Vermont,

from Canaan, New York, the Burnham Industrial Farm, etc.

Staid September 22 at Cleveland. At Warren, the 23d, ad-

dressed the multitude at the dedication of the monument. The

next day to Cincinnati.

  [The] 25th, National Prison Congress. Spoke in the evening

at the Odeon, Twelfth Street. A good attendance of members

of the congress; a slim attendance of Cincinnati people--very.

The next three days a fine attendance of prison people. Sunday

at Vine Street Congregational church. The pastor very energetic

and in full sympathy.

  [The] 29th, Monday evening, with Frances to New York.

Wednesday, October 1, [the] meeting of Peabody Trust. The

talk of Senator Gibson and Mr. Courtenay on the policy of con-

centration, as they call it, shows a diversity of opinion in the

board. Many of us prefer one great institution at Nashville as

the final useful monument to Mr. Peabody. The gentlemen

named want to divide the fund. Many institutions--one in

each State. I think the States will establish each its own

normal school. Let these schools have an ideal, a model--the

great Normal College at Nashville.

  In the evening the usual banquet. Frances looked well, and

was much praised for sweetness, vivacity, and character.

  Mrs. Cleveland is amiable and attractive. Mrs. Curry, of

Virginia, was the admired and admirable lady of the evening.

A daughter of Mr. Henry was very handsome. Never so many

fine ladies present. Ex-President Cleveland was sensible and

friendly. He is sensitive still to the newspaper comments on his

health.

  Mr. Hilliard, of Atlanta, has written a book and will soon

print.

  Thursday, October 2, dined with Mead. Second meeting of

Peabody Fund.    Adjourned until first Wednesday after first

Monday of October, 1891.









<B>602          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Friday, October 3, via New Haven to Brattleboro. Met Char-

lotte [DeWitt] at station. With her to Brooks House. P. M.

3:30 drove to the old home, the grandfather's home, in West

Brattleboro. Mrs. Mary Hayes Bigelow has it for her summer

home. Winter etc., in New York.

  Called on Sophia E. Smith, West Village. In the evening saw

John DeWitt at his home; a fine young fellow with wife and

child.

  Saturday [the] 4th, with Charlotte P. DeWitt on the narrow

gauge to Newfane, twelve miles northwest of Brattleboro.

  At the Jail House with Mr. Underwood  and daughters; a

good inn. Visited Mrs. Milom Davidson and met there Mr.

and Mrs. Gilbert Edgerton. Then the new Birchard home, build-

ing on the site of the burned house. Slept at the Jail Inn.

  [My] birthday.  Sixty-eight.  A fine full day--foliage never

so rich before.

  Drove to Townsend with Charlotte. Called on Rev. Clifford

Smith, son of cousin Sophia, a fine-looking, intelligent man,

wife and son. Left in a shower which soon held up. A delight-

ful drive.

  Sunday, [the] 5th, at Newfane. Walked on narrow gauge be-

fore breakfast south past the two fine elms in Mr. Davidson's

pasture. At church, 2 P. M. Mr. Smith lacks fire; does not

put voice and vim into his delivery. Evening again at church

and heard Clifford Smith. Slept again at Jail Inn.

  Monday, [the] 6th, left for Brattleboro, Springfield, and Burn-

ham Farm. Met at Canaan depot by Mr. William F. Round and

driven to the farm. About forty unmanageable boys. Seven

"brothers," volunteers who  [serve] for five dollars a month,

board and clothing. Rise at 5:30 A. M.; do all sorts of farm

work; in barns, milking, stock, etc. Rich men pay one hundred

and fifty dollars per year for their sons and for two other poor

boys the same sum each. Like Metway, as it was. In the eve-

ning singing, etc., in chapel. Spoke to them eight minutes. A

good audience.

  October 7, Tuesday, [was] rainy. Up at the cottage with

Mrs. Round; called on her mother; and left Canaan for Albany









             <B>VISIT TO ANCESTRAL HOME          603</B>



about 11 A. M. At Albany met Colonel Charles E. Felton, of

Chicago. To have the good company, changed hastily on to his,

the first train out. Travelled with him most pleasantly to Buf-

falo. Then took upper berth to Cleveland. Home at 9:30 this

morning. Spiegel looking lovely with its glorious fall colors.

Adda Huntington in charge. Good.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, October 9, 1890.

  CHARLES R. MILLER, ESQUIRE,

    Canton, Ohio.

  I have just read your letter. The alleged interview<B>*</B> is a fab-

rication. I never said anything of the sort to anybody.

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.



           SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, October 9, 1890.

  MY DEAR MADAM:--I was absent from home when I was

pained to hear of the death of your partiotic and able husband.

I pray that you and your stricken household may have the best

consolations Heaven bestows in such afflictions.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. BENJAMIN F. PEIXOTTO,

    Brooklyn, New York.



  October 10.  Friday.--A long talk with Colonel Haynes, our

Member of Congress. He said many things it was very pleasant

to hear. His intercourse with men of all parties and sections

has been intimate at Washington. He dwelt on the good things

now heard at Washington on all sides as to my family, Mrs.

Hayes, my Administration, and myself.

  General and Mrs. Force came on 2:30 P. M. train from

Sandusky. A pleasant ride all around town. In the evening

attended church meeting. Our new pastor was frank and bus-



<FONT SIZE="-1">  *In Mansfield Herald, of October 3, criticizing the McKinley

tariff bill.</FONT>









<B>604          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



inesslike. The congregation is demoralized on financial duties

by the shiftlessness of the last [pastor] (Mr. Mills) in all bus-

iness [concerns].

  October 11. Saturday.--The funeral of Mrs. Phelps here

this morning. Rev. Alanson and Mrs. Phelps lived here (and

in this house when first built, for a short time), a few years.

Mrs. Phelps was a charming and excellent woman in her prime.

  Afternoon, with General Force to the court-house to attend a

pioneer meeting. Well attended. General Buckland presided.

He called for talkers by township, as Rice, Riley, Ballville, etc.

Interesting and cheerful talks.  I spoke of Lucy's ancestors,

father, etc. The battle of Ballville, I described. After a de-

lightful visit, General and Mrs. Force went home.

  Our new pastor, Mr. Albritton, wife, and two sons came to

stay with us while the parsonage is getting ready for their oc-

cupancy.
