                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 9, 1872.

   DEAR UNCLE:--I feel foolishly happy this, my first day of

      freedom.  For a week or two past, there has been a feel-

ing with me that something might happen to cast a shadow on

the four years of good fortune in the governor's office. Besides

I was hurried with perplexing business to the last moment. To-

day I am independent. Our big reception went off nicely.

Everybody says pleasant things. It looks as if I might have

been Senator. My refusal gives me position, and, true or not,

the common remark is that I am the most esteemed of the gov-

ernors within the memory of people living. But enough of this

vanity.

  I read in the Supreme Court this morning a fine eulogy on

Tom Ewing sent me by my old friend Judge William Johnston.

  Birch left this morning. I never enjoyed his companionship

so much as during this visit. I tested his intellect in various

little ways. It is very solid. His modesty and physical inert-

ness are in the way of progress, but I hope he will in a good de-

gree overcome both as he gets older.

  I shall probably come up in a short time and visit you three

or four days.

  I send you a Duluth paper with some articles marked. I

think the question of its growth is now settled in its favor.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 9, 1872.

  MY DEAR JUDGE:--Your letter of the second came on time.

I got the sketch of Mr. Ewing Sunday, and read it today to a

                         <B>(190)</B>









             <B>REFUSES SENATORSHIP--1872          191</B>



good audience of the best lawyers in this part of the State in the

supreme court room.  It was universally appreciated as you

would wish. I regret you could not have delivered it in person.

There were no solid speeches made. The resolutions and pre-

amble were much better than common.

  I am a free man again and jolly as a beggar. I should be glad

[to] meet you while I am my own man to talk as of old. We

will return to Cincinnati in a few weeks to enjoy ourselves until

something turns up. -- Our regards to Mrs. Johnston.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM JOHNSTON,

       Washington, D. C.

                          COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 9, 1872.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I have had no leisure to write you be-

fore. It really gave me much gratification to see the charitable

and friendly way in which you take my decision adverse to your

wishes. I thank you for it.

  I also have to thank you for the excellent little book of Gen-

eral Beirce. I found to my surprise and to the surprise of the

librarian himself, that the work was already in the library. I

therefore, will, if you please, keep it myself. It will from my

hands go either to the Historical Society of Cincinnati or some

other similar place.

                  Believe me sincerely, yours,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL A. C. VORIS,

      Akron, Ohio.





  Wednesday, January 10, 1872.--The Republican caucus last

week nominated Sherman for Senator. I had peremptorily with-

drawn. One senator, Mr. Gage of Findlay, refused to vote for

Sherman and voted for Schenck. A number of the others re-

mained in caucus, eight, it is said, with the understanding that

they were not to be held bound by the result. But they all voted

for Sherman's nomination. This was regarded as final.









<B>192          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Yesterday, in compliance with the law of Congress, the two

houses voted separately for Senator. In the Senate seventeen

Republicans voted for Sherman and one, Mr. Gage, for Schenck.

In the House fifty-seven, all of the straight Republicans, voted

for Sherman.  General Powell, Independent Republican, voted

for Cox, and the Democrats of the two houses all voted for

General Morgan.  This seemed conclusive and that no split

would occur in the Republican ranks.

  Last night, after I had put out the lights and was about re-

tiring, the bell was rung.  On coming down and opening the door,

a senator, General Casement, and Ford, a representative, both

Republicans, entered.  I took them into the parlor.  The senator

began promptly:  "Well, I come to business at once.  We want

to make you Senator.  There are eight Republicans, three sen-

ators and five representatives, who are ready to stand in the

breach.  John Sherman is a corrupt man and ought to be de-

feated.  I have nothing personal against him.         He  and his

brothers have always treated me well, but he is utterly corrupt,

and I mean to beat him.  We can do it, if you will consent.

There are many Republicans who are opposed to him, but they

will vote for him on one or two ballots, yielding to the majority.

His defeat is certain if you consent.      Besides, the man now

elected Senator over the caucus will be the next President of

the United States."

  This is the substance of his talk.  It was earnest and rapid,

at times somewhat warm.  The representative was less con-

fident, but felt sure of five or six who would bolt to elect either

Hayes or Garfield. Names were given and other particulars.

  My reply was that, with my views of duty, I could not honor-

ably consent and would not.  The senator said it was strange to

see the senatorship refused with the Presidency in prospect.

The conversation lasted perhaps fifteen minutes.  I made the

point on them that they were now committed to Sherman them-

selves; that the public would so regard it; that their votes in

caucus and in the Legislature were totally inconsistent with

their present efforts.  The senator did most of the talking.  He

replied that those votes did not bind them.  That his nature was

for open, square work, but that to beat the trickery and money









             <B>REFUSES SENATORSHIP--1872          193</B>



of Sherman, there must be some concealment of purpose; that

if the design had been known, money would have been used to

buy Democratic votes.

  I urged the importance of not splitting the Republican party;

of electing a Republican President once more, at least; that the

defeat of Grant now was to give the Government to the enemies

of the recent amendments and to unsettle all.

   The senator said he was not hostile to Grant, but Grant had

done many bad things and his defeat by a good Republican

would be a good thing. At last he asked: "Well, if we vote for

and elect you, will you not accept?"

   I replied that my decision applied to the whole thing; that I

 would not be used for the purpose he wished in any way, or

under any circumstances.  They left with handshakings and the

 remark by the senator that it was "strange to see a man throw

away the senatorship."

   I went to bed after telling it to Lucy who laughed and said

she would not sleep now for fear of some Democrat slipping in.

 I soon fell into a sound sleep; was aroused by repeated ringing

of my door-bell.  Went down in my nightshirt.  In came my

 friend John G. Deshler, who said a party had been meeting at

his house for a week past, that they were now there, had been

all the evening, and that they could elect me and had decided to

do it. if I would consent.  That a senator, not heretofore counted

on, would vote for me. That the voting had been between Hor-

ton, Garfield, and me; that I had been the favorite, but that not

until now was there a united vote for me sufficient to elect.  Two

Democrats had been bought by Sherman.  Sands was here with

money and the presidents of two Mansfield banks were on hand

for Sherman.  "But now  I believe we can elect you and you

must consent."

   This was all said rapidly with no pause to hear from me. I

said:  "Well, I can't honorably do it and there is no use talking;

it is settled and has been for weeks." He said: "Well, if you

say that, I must give it up. I admire your principle, but John

Sherman wouldn't do it. Say nothing about this." And he re-

turned to his carriage and I to sleep. The senator [had] said at

    13









<B>194          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



parting, "This ought to be private, but it is among gentlemen and

I need say nothing."

  The election by joint convention of the two houses will take

place today at noon. I am curious to see what these gentlemen

will do. Lucy says: "Thank fortune we don't want to be

elected that way.  If we were Democrats, it would do--all the

votes of our own party and a few of the other. That would

do."

  At the bar meeting held in the Supreme Court room yesterday

morning on the occasion of Mr. Ewing's death, I heard a remark

worth noting from Judge J. R. Swan. Noticing how changed

Mr. H. H. Hunter, the president of the meeting, was -- how thin

he was getting, -- Judge Swan said: "As men get old, they

either dry up or swell and puff up like old rotting logs. I don't

know which is to be preferred."



                              COLUMBUS, January 10, 1872.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I have your second letter on the commission.

With the number three there ought to be no objection to the ap-

pointment of a Democrat. The question then is how I can best

serve you. I do not in cases of special interest undertake to

write by mail to the President. My habit is to write a letter to

some friend with the request that he will see the President and

show him or read to him what I say.  For this purpose I select

the friend of the President who is most likely to be also friendly

to the object of my communication. I have tried Morton, Bout-

well, Colfax, General Dent, and others. Without exception I

think they have had consideration for my suggestions -- not al-

ways favorable of course, but attention has been given to the

matters referred to. Now, who do you suggest? Would Sher-

man, Bingham, Perry, or Stevenson be favorable?

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE C. REEMELIN,

      Cincinnati, Ohio.



  January 11, 1872.--One of my pet schemes for the future

will be to form -- to collect -- a complete library of Ohio books,









             <B>RETURN TO CINCINNATI--1872          195</B>



books relating to the State. I may hope, at least, for twenty

years of life. In that time I may gather what in the State

Library, or other fit place, will be of much interest.





                              COLUMBUS, January 11, 1872.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I am in receipt of your letter of the 9th and

have with great satisfaction suggested your name to Governor

Noyes this morning. It is possible that the same commission

may be charged with the erection of both monuments, -- Har-

rison's and Hamer's. If so, the chance of your appointment

would be less.

  The governor will listen to the senator and representative from

your county. It would perhaps be well for you to advise them

also of your wishes.

  I am quite hopeful that this tardy justice may now be done.

It shall have such support from me as I can properly give.

I said to a friend that if it failed with this Legislature, I would

try to get a seat in the next and make it a pet scheme until car-

ried. I will try to give your proposed article wide circulation.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  COLONEL JOHN G. MARSHALL,

       Georgetown, Ohio.

                              COLUMBUS, January 20, 1872.

  MY DEAR GUY: -- We are deeply pained to hear of your

overwhelming loss.<B>*</B>  We sympathize  with you--we  sorrow

with you -- we feel it as an affliction in our own family.  I

came from Fremont yesterday, where I had spent a few days

with Uncle on the occasion of his seventy-first birthday. Our

talk was more than usual of you and the comfort we had in

your visit last summer. He will share your grief. But what

is all this? May God bless you and give you the best consolation

possible. I feel that to talk of such a loss is mockery.

  We go back to Cincinnati next week.  We go back gladly

notwithstanding we have had a pleasant life here.

                          As ever,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

      Texas.

                       CINCINNATI, OHIO, February 1, 1872.

  MY DEAR UNCLE:--We are getting settled quite pleasantly.

Shoemaker has a son and his wife boarding here.  He  (Shoe-

maker) told little Fan that you gave him a wagon cover, which

made him (Shoemaker) your fast friend for life. This, when he

was setting out in life. Curious how little things -- acts of kind-

ness -- stick even in flinty natures.

  I send you a letter of General Leslie Coombs to put with those

of the other bigwigs. Also a State Journal giving a good ac-

count of my doings, and a fine article on Buttles.  Buttles died

of delirium brought on by his dreadful vice or frailty.

  We are received in a most cordial way by old friends.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                             CINCINNATI, February 4, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- Thanks for the draft. . . . I shall enjoy

life here, but more and more I am satisfied with my final decision

on two points--public life and my  permanent residence in

future. . . .     All well.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  Cincinnati, February 13, 1872. -- Returned here about the last

of January, took rooms for Lucy, Fanny, Scott R., Winnie (our

servant), and self at the Carlisle House, near our old home, at

fifty dollars per week. I temporarily office with Clinton Kirby,

Esq., northwest corner Sixth and Walnut.

1636," p. 531, in the autobiography of Rev. Thomas Shepard,

it appears that in 1634 he stopped in Ipswich, England, with John

Russell and afterwards with Edward Collins.  Both were prob-

ably afterwards of Cambridge and ancestors of the Hayes family.

  I want to study up railroad law, and railroad business gener-

ally. Especially as to the construction of railroads.

  February 14, 1872. -- Send to the State Library all of the

letters on the governors' portraits, with my manuscript account

of them.



                                    DULUTH, March 1, 1872.

  DEAREST: -- I reached here this evening after dark. The snow

is gradually shrinking under the warm sun, but is still eight or

ten inches at least.  The weather is good--bright, clear skies,

and bracing, dry air. I walked out with General Le Duc and

looked at the block. It is well looking. Talked with two of the

tenants--the shoe store and the hardware men.  They were

evidently proud of their stores.

  I should feel very happy if I knew you were all well. But

remembering what I said about no news, I conclude you are all

right. If I hear nothing unfavorable I will remain here and out

on the Northern Pacific perhaps a week longer.

  Sincerely--no, not so cold--affectionately and lovingly,

                              Your

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                    DULUTH, March 3, 1872.

  MY DARLIING: -- Sunday seems the family day and so I write.

This morning I walked down to Oneota (up it is) to visit Rogers.

I found them living in about our sized quarters with the addition

of a kitchen and upstairs. But very neatly papered and ordered

in a homelike way. They seemed as happy as any family I have

seen in a long time.  Mrs. Rogers is a noble woman. . . .

  The works here are something wonderful in dimensions and in

the energy with which they are driven forward. I speak of the

Northern Pacific docks and the other harbor works. The harbor

will be one of the best, perhaps the very best, on all the lakes.









<B>198          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  The winter weather here is perfect, clear, still, bracing, and

good sleighing for three months past.

  We go out on the Northern Pacific tomorrow. The trip will

pretty well use up the week, so I can hardly get home before

the 11th or 12th. I hear nothing from you. I infer from this

silence that you are getting on well. . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                  DULUTH, March 7, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I returned here from the west side of Red

River of the North this afternoon, after a fine trip through the

wilderness and winter snows. Rogers was with me, also the

officers of the North Pacific who are hereabouts. We slept in a

tent as comfortably as ever, in Dakota Territory. Ours was the

first passenger car that ever went to Red River. The snow is not

very deep--about a foot and four inches.  The railroad cuts

have been full of snow. We passed through the snow ten or

fifteen feet higher than the top of the car. There is no difficulty

on this line in protecting it perfectly from snow blockades.  The

men in charge are fine gentlemen of the right stamp. Almost

all are Vermonters.

  The great docks are building with the greatest rapidity in the

harbor here. Colonel Gaw, who remembers and speaks pleasantly

of you, is in charge, and has shown me all about it.

  The building [ours] is a good one and is rented to the best

tenants in town. I shall stay with Rogers until Monday and hope

to reach Fremont Wednesday, March 13.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                              CINCINNATI, March 17, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . .  I found Green (the president of

[the] Hocking Valley Railroad) very enthusiastic for the Co-

lumbus Railroad that I am thinking of. Ben Smith told me if

I would take hold of it, he would get up a company in two hours









             <B>RETURN TO CINCINNATI--1872          199</B>



who would put it through. Dennison was more cautious, but

favorable. The road must be, they all say, mainly a Toledo Road.

I easily persuaded Green and Smith that it might go by Tiffin

and Fremont, but Dennison doubted. If the Legislature passes

the bill before it, allowing aid by a vote of towns to railroads, I

shall consider seriously this project. If I don't go into it myself,

I mean to try to force it through by way of Fremont.

  I shall come up as soon as the bill passes.

                    Sincerely and love to all,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                          CINCINNATI, OHIO, March 24, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . It now seems likely that the Con-

stitutional Convention will not be elected until a year from next

April. The bill pending in the Legislature which authorizes

local aid to railroads by a popular vote will probably pass, but

there is still a degree of uncertainty about it. I will talk it over

with you again, but I am much inclined to go ahead with the

Toledo project from Columbus, hoping to turn it to the ad-

vantage of Fremont.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.





  April 15, 1872. -- Dined Sunday at 5 P. M. at Mr. Halstead's.

The purpose of the occasion was to meet Mr. William C. Bryant

who is returning to his home in New York from a trip during the

winter to Cuba and Mexico. The party consisted of William

S. Groesbeck, Joseph Longworth, Colonel Nichols, Governor

Cox, Judge [Alphonso] Taft, Mr. Theodore Cook, Mr. William

Henry Davis and myself, of Cincinnati, and two gentlemen who

were travelling with Mr. Bryant, Mr. Thompson, of the Post,

and Mr. Durand, of -----.  Mr. Halstead sat at the head of

the table with Mr. Bryant at his right hand.

  Mr. Bryant was seventy-seven years old last November. He

is a slender, rather spare man, about five feet eight inches high,









<B>200          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



weight perhaps now not more than one hundred and ten. He

has lost the hair on the top of his head, but has an abundance of

rather long, fine, white locks, with a beautiful white beard and

mustache -- the beard quite long. He has a patriarchal look,

justifying the greeting he says he received from an old Irish-

woman, a servant at the hotel in Havannah:  "Oh sir, I welcome

you back; you are like one of the old saints!" His eyes are

dark, probably black, and shine brightly and pleasantly when

not hidden by his large, shaggy, white eyebrows. His looks and

manners are very winning and lovable. His intellect is clear,

his talk vigorous, interesting, pithy, and  friendly.  Modesty,

kindness, and serenity possess him, or he possesses them. There

was much talk by Governor Cox, Judge Taft, and Mr. Groes-

beck of his translations of the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey." Mr.

Bryant with quiet frankness briefly told how he came to write

them. He did not disparage the works of others. Lord Derby's

translation, accurate and good, but some critic had said it was

Homer exactly "with the poetry left out." Pope was beautifully

done, fine poetry, but there was haste and carelessness in render-

ing difficult or obscure passages. It was often Pope but not

Homer.

  "After reading Lord Derby's parting of Hector and Androm-

ache, I wrote a translation of it.  In 1864 the editors of the

Atlantic asked me for something.  I told them  I had nothing

unless they would take a translation in blank verse  'The Parting,

etc.' They took it. After it was published, I received letters

from Longfellow and Lowell urging me to go on and make a

translation of the whole poem. This encouraged me and I went

on working some every day until it was done."

  He told three or four short anecdotes, imitating Yankee and

negro peculiarities of tone and pronunciation, and told them well

and in good time. "Americans pronounce more distinctly and

fully, better than Englishmen." "I have visited Europe six times

and feel familiarly acquainted with many of the most interest-

ing things there, paintings, buildings, and scenes."

  "I practiced law ten years in Massachusetts. I have been in

journalism about forty-six years. I do not work much at jour-

nalism now. I prefer other work. Unless a man is very hope-









             <B>RETURN TO CINCINNATI--1872          201</B>



ful in disposition, the tendency of the wrangling which occupies

one in the law or in journalism is to make one misanthropic."

  Mr. Bryant listened to a recitation of one of his poems by Mr.

Joseph Longworth. He said, "I wrote that when I was about

twenty-one. You put into it more than I did."



                          CINCINNATI, OHIO, April 15, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I was at an interesting dinner party of about

ten or twelve gentlemen yesterday to meet the poet, Bryant.

     . . . He talks clearly, modestly, and entertainingly.  He is a

winning old gentleman.  Nothing at all that is not lovable and

admirable about him. He was seventy-seven last November.

He told about himself in reply to questions in a modest way

but with entire frankness. He gave us the how and why of his

writing the translations of Homer which you have.  Also a few

good apt anecdotes in which, in a very quiet way, he imitated the

Yankee tone and the negro peculiarities. . . .

  If [Charles Francis] Adams is nominated [by the Liberal Re-

publicans] and the Democrats can be brought to his support, it

will make a doubtful struggle.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                                CINCINNATI, April 23, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . The Columbus railroad to Toledo is

quite likely to go ahead. I can't get it direct to Fremont, but I

think I succeeded in convincing them that it should go as far

as Upper Sandusky and that a branch by Tiffin and Fremont to

Put-in-Bay would be a good thing. The Toledo entrance of the

railroad, Hall was figuring at, he tells me is still unsettled, but

he thinks it will go down the river bank. . . .

                           Sincerely,

                                R. B. HAYES.

looks as if it might be serious.--H.

                         CINCINNATI, OHIO, April 30, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- The city is filling up with Liberals.  No doubt

the number here is largely greater than the constituency they

represent requires. But I am satisfied that the opposition to

Grant, if it could be united, would carry the country.  But the

prospect of such unity does not strike me as probable. The

leading candidates are [Charles Francis] Adams and Judge

[David] Davis. Adams would carry off more Republicans than

any other man, but would not, I think, get a solid Democratic

support. In fact, I suspect they would repudiate him. Judge

Davis would be dropped by a large share of the Liberal Repub-

licans. But as he would probably get the solid Democratic vote

he would be very formidable. But I need not speculate about it.

The affair is as well understood abroad as it is here. A new

man in such cases is always a possibility. I am glad to be out

of such a muss. . . .

                          Sincerely,           R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  May 6, 1872. -- With Lucy and Miss Emma Foote and others,

attended the Liberal Republican Convention on the second and

third, the two important days. We witnessed the intense dis-

appointment of our friends Matthews and Hoadly when Adams

was beaten by Greeley. At the moment, the feeling was common

that Grant would win. I am not confident of results. If the

Democrats adopt Greeley as their candidate he may win, and

win by a large majority. The people are sick of politics, ready

for change, and may break in any new direction. Yet, I rather

incline to the opinion that the Democrats will find a dissent in

their own ranks, when they take up Greeley, which they can't

control--a dissent strong enough to let Grant keep the chair.

  A  queer result, it is.  Free-traders nominate their bitterest

and most formidable foe; a party whose strength is mainly in the

German element, which is clamorous against temperance fanati-

cism, nominates the author of that fanaticism! Democrats are

required to support a man who said that he would go for Grant

in preference to any Democrat. "Anything to beat a Democrat,"









             <B>NOMINATION OF GREELEY--1872          203</B>



has been and was up to the day of his nomination his lifelong

motto.

  Frank Blair was on the stand, the author of the Broadhead

letter!

  Who has at one time advocated, and at another scouted prin-

ciples, schemes, and issues in like number and in such variety?





                                 CINCINNATI, May 14, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I am sorry to hear you are still in a worri-

ment over "help." That is the serious question in this country.

More discomfort and unhappiness is [are] caused by it than are

occasioned by war, pestilence, and famine. Time will bring a

remedy, no doubt, but I fear not in our day.

  We  hope to get the little folks up to Worline's farm [near

Delaware] Saturday next. Both are now pretty well again, and

I am confident little Scott will get through the summer there,

but he probably would not here.

  Against my protest, and with no chance to resign until the

committee had gone, I was made one of the delegates at large

to [the National Republican Convention at] Philadelphia for

this State. It probably will be smoother to go than by resigning

to get ranked with the Greeley men, until I come out with a

personal card.

  Grant's chances seem to improve since the nomination of

Greeley.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                                 CINCINNATI, May 16, 1872.

  DEAR GENERAL: -- The commissioners to select the site for the

proposed new United States Building in Cincinnati, will, it is

understood, recommend that the amount appropriated for the

purchase of ground be increased five hundred thousand dollars.

I trust you will support this recommendation. It is the opinion

of our best judges in such matters that the commissioners are

altogether right. Such a building as it is proposed to build









<B>204          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ought to have ample space for streets of all widths on all sides

of it; and should be placed on the best square in the city. But

I need not urge the matter. You will see the propriety of putting

Cincinnati and Ohio on the same footing with St. Louis and

Missouri.

  Hoping that you will succeed in doing what is suggested, I

remain,

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  JAMES A. GARFIELD,

      Washington.



  May 17, 1872. -- Greeley's position is this: He will support

Grant in preference to any Democrat.  No Democrat is fit for

President. "If Democrats will support me they will do well,

but if I support any Democrat I would do wrong. For Demo-

crats to support me is praiseworthy, but for me to support a

Democrat is blameworthy. I am good enough to get the vote of

any Democrat, but no Democrat is good enough to get my vote."

  Jere Black says to Donn Piatt: "The nomination kills the

platform. Greeley is one of the authors of the wrongs com-

plained of." He must reform himself into his opposite, if he

would have reformation. "A candidate's record is the can-

didate."

  May 23, 1872. -- Two miles above Delaware, at farm of Albert

Worline.  Came yesterday, for the health of the family during

the summer. Fanny needs the good air and outdoor life. But

especially Scott Russell.



                                 DELAWARE, June 10, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I returned from the Philadelphia convention

yesterday. It was completely successful in all respects. It was

united, harmonious, and the most enthusiastic convention any of

us ever saw. The recent vindictive attacks on General Grant

have created a strong reaction in his favor, which accounts for

the unexpected feeling in his behalf. I mean the unlooked-for

enthusiasm. . . .









             <B>NOMINATION OF GREELEY--1872          205</B>



   I will come out next week, say about the 19th, if nothing oc-

curs to prevent.            

                            Sincerely,

                                                       HAYES.

   S. BIRCHARD.

                          ITHACA, NEW YORK, June 24, 1872.

   MY DARLING:--Our boys are doing pretty well.  Webb has

got through three out of his four examinations. Birch looks

well and is happy.

   I stopped one day at Meadville, and found General Wright

living in just about such a home as the Swayne mansion.  They

get it furnished for six hundred dollars! They eat at a nice

hotel near by at about our Worline rates.  I was the first Co-

lumbus friend that the family had seen.

   I expect to come to Delaware about Thursday.         I do hope

little Scott is well. Kiss little Fanny, and remember how fond

and proud I am of my charming Lucy.

                         Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES,

       Delaware, Ohio.

                            DELAWARE, OHIO, June 30, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I returned from Cornell on Thursday. The

institution has greatly improved since I was there about two

years ago. It is making thorough and accurate scholars. It does

not cultivate the merely showy. Possibly it errs in the opposite

direction. For example, the substance, including style, of the

speeches was quite superior. But the delivery showed lack of

culture in elocution.

  Birch ranks extremely well. His conduct, character, and

scholarship were all mentioned with commendation, both by

students and professors.

  The examinations are unusually severe. Webb will probably

get in with conditions, but the boys can give you the latest in-

formation on that. . . .

  I stopped at Meadville one day and had the project of building

a new railroad into Cincinnati under the auspices of the Atlantic









<B>206          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and Great Western people fully explained by General Wright.

It looks well. Nothing definite will be known for several weeks.

The probability is that it will go forward and that I will take

a hand [in] it.

  I go to Cincinnati in a day or two. If not prevented by this

railroad business, I intend to spend next week with you--8th

to 13th -- when we can make the long talked-of visit to Toledo.



                            Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

   S. BIRCHARD.



  July 6, 1872.--Went to Cincinnati Tuesday, 2nd.  Spent the

Fourth pleasantly with Brother Joe at Longview Asylum. To-

day returned here (Delaware).

  July 16, 1872.  Delaware.--Returned last night from Fre-

mont. . . . The look of the political field is not at all satis-

factory. I know but little. Nasby says there are four hundred

Greeley Republicans in Toledo; that his correspondence in con-

nection with the Blade shows eight to twelve Greeley Republicans

in each of the townships in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Treas-

urer Warner wants me to address a meeting in Wellington; that

there are perhaps forty Greeley Republicans there, among them

the old member from Lorain, Dickson, Hoar, and other men of

some prominence. Sumner's speech, he thinks, is doing con-

siderable mischief. In other towns of Lorain, he thinks, ten or a

dozen in each will go off. In Sandusky county Everett thinks

there is but little Greeleyism; that we shall gain.

  Altogether it is plain to my mind that Greeley will win, if the

Democrats support him with their whole force. I think they

can't do it, but I fear it. I fear that the thing is in great doubt,

but I have seen too little to be positive. I must say that I have

just now a feeling that Greeley will be elected!

  July 17.  Wednesday. -- On Sunday with Uncle I spent some

time looking at bittersweet vines in Spiegel Grove. I handled

them, too. On Monday evening I felt on my forehead a little

itching as if bitten by mosquitoes. Tuesday it increased. Today









             <B>NOMINATED FOR CONGRESS--1872          207</B>



I am poisoned about the eyes, on the forehead and temples. I

am using a solution of sugar of lead and water with good results.

Dr. Blymer tells me that bittersweet is poisonous.

  July 21. Monday.--One week after the poisoning the thing

is about at an end.

  Finished reading William L. Stowe's "Life of Brant." It is

a general history of the Indian wars, etc., etc., during his life.

A good deal of general history with a small amount of Brant.



                           DELAWARE, OHIO, July 24, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . . I am importuned in numerous letters

to run for Congress. That I could be nominated and elected,

the writers are confident. I reply to them, "out of the question."

  The poisoning must have been from the bittersweet, yet it is

possible otherwise. Some plants are poisonous only at particular

seasons. I am now over it. It was bad a few days.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  July [25], 1872. -- I do not want to return to Congress and,

of course, do not wish to be nominated. Having said to several

gentlemen who were named as probable candidates that I did

not mean to run, I cannot consent under any circumstances to

allow my name to be used against them. If it is the general wish

of the Republicans, and also of the candidates themselves that

I should be nominated, I cannot refuse my assent. I greatly

prefer that some other citizen be made the candidate.

  This is the true state of the case, but I must not say so. I

have not said so because the consent, conditional though it is,

would be used to force other candidates out of the way.



                                CINCINNATI, August 1, 1872.

  GENTLEMEN:--I am in receipt of your communication as to

the candidacy for Representative to Congress from the Second

District. The good opinion of me implied in the request you









<B>208          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



make, I appreciate very highly, but am constrained by circum-

stances beyond my control not to allow my name to be used be-

fore the convention.

  With great respect, I remain,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  RICHARD SMITH, et al.

Private.

                          DELAWARE, OHIO, August 2, 1872.

  DEAR S--:--. . .  I write chiefly on account of the article

in the Gazette.  I am fearful there will be an attempt to use my

name in the convention against Davis and the other candidates

in the same way Craighead's was used against Gunckel. I want

you to see that it is not done. I do not want a nomination at all

under any circumstances, but if this should be done, it would

be particularly annoying. I will write Smith also.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  R. H. STEPHENSON.



  August 5, (Monday) 1872. Fremont.--I am importuned to

be a candidate for Congress. It is contrary to my wishes and

plans to consent. Besides, my friend, William E. Davis, and

others are candidates with the understanding that I will not run.

It is probable, from what I hear, that the nomination of both

Davis and Eggleston will injure the party. Eggleston is quite

sure to be nominated. There is a contest against Davis. He

telegraphs me this forenoon to send my decision to the president

of the convention to his care.  This I shall do.

  The case stands this way:  I do not want to return to Con-

gress, and, of course, do not wish to be nominated.        Having

said to several gentlemen who were named as probable can-

didates that I did not mean to run, I can not under any cir-

cumstances consent to allow my name to be used against them.

If it is the general wish of the Republicans, and also of the can-

didates themselves, that I should be nominated, I can not re-

fuse my assent.  But I greatly prefer not to do so.  I do not

and shall not say this much to anybody, because this reluctant









             <B>NOMINATED FOR CONGRESS--1872          209</B>



and conditional consent might be used to force other candidates

out of the way. No doubt the desire that I should run is very

strong and general.

  August 6.--Uncle says the katydids always appear here be-

tween the second and sixth of August. This year they came the

fourth.

  "A Dr. Powers, a man of fine appearance and talents, was rode

out of town  [Delaware]  for lewdness, as was believed with

      ----.  Your father and I went up to the farm to be out of the

way. All of the other respectable men of the town took part in

the lynching." This, in Delaware about 1820.

  August 7, 1872.--I heard yesterday that I was nominated for

Congress in [the] Second District. This was against my earnest

protest. I fear Davis will feel hurt. On getting a dispatch from

him,  I sent a peremptory withdrawal.        I also sent one to

[Richard]  Smith.  But in the evening I got a dispatch from

Smith that the convention had adjourned and that my declina-

tion would be disastrous.  If I could get out of it creditably I

would. But I fear I must stand it. I will see.

  August 8, 1872.--Accounts  of [the]  convention  in  [the]

Second District show that my declination to run was fairly before

it. On the whole, as I now see it, I must run. The whole thing

is, I confess, flattering. The only annoyance is that I am seem-

ingly in the way of Davis, and I regret that he was placed in an

unpleasant position.  He talked and behaved well about it.

  Uncle has a cough which he don't shake off and is weaker

than usual. I fear he can not stand the winter through. He is

cheerful and in most admirable frame of mind.  What a wonder-

fully fine disposition and character he has. So affectionate, kind,

and just a man is rarely found.



                         DELAWARE, OHIO, August 10, 1872.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Returning from Fremont last night, I

found your dispatch of the 7th. On hearing of the nomination

and long before the convention adjourned, I sent dispatches to

Smith of the Gazette and William E. Davis explicitly declining

   14









<B>210          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to accept. There would have been time after the receipt of the

dispatches to nominate another. I am now placed in a position

where to withdraw might be injurious to the cause. I shall

probably stand. But I wish to be uncommitted until I come down

and see how it is.  Many reasons, mostly of a private nature,

make the thing distasteful. But I feel pleased by what you and

others say, and I shall not worry about it any more. It annoyed

me for a time.

  I will come down and stop at the Gibson House Wednesday

afternoon. Hope to see you that evening.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.

                         DELAWARE, OHIO. August 11, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . .  I go to Cincinnati on Wednesday

and will remain there and in the Ohio River country about ten

days.

  By the by, I found here a letter from responsible parties at

Portsmouth asking me to take charge of the Ohio River Railroad

to which they have just voted three hundred thousand dollars.

  Since my nomination the Democratic [nominee], Judge Hoef-

fer, has declined to be a candidate. They will put up some

stronger man.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                              CINCINNATI, August 18, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I find it would have been positively offensive

to my best friends if I had refused to run. The thing could not

be avoided honorably. So if I am beaten, it is to be classed with

the inevitable.  But it looks well.  My nomination seems really

to delight people.  The Enquirer this morning says:  "John Shiff,

Democratic candidate for Congress, stated yesterday that he

should support General Hayes." I suppose this is true. The

Enquirer people cheated Shiff out of the nomination and put up a

clever but weak Republican.









             <B>NOMINATED FOR CONGRESS--1872          211</B>



  . . .  The exhibition of paintings at the exposition here

next month will probably be the finest ever seen in the country.

It will contain not only all the good paintings here, but a pro-

digious collection sent from New York and other Eastern cities.

  I attend two meetings up the river and home the last of the

week to the family at Delaware. Possibly will come to Fre-

mont next week.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                     CINCINNATI, Sunday, August 18, 1872.

  MY DARLING: -- I am writing in Herron's pleasant library.

All gone but John and the servants. . . . The candidacy

was inevitable; escape impossible. All seem delighted except

Davis, "Policy Bill," and the common enemy. Davis behaves

pretty well. Perhaps I ought to say, very well, under the cir-

cumstances--the circumstances being that he had got a mono-

mania to run for Congress. The slips cut from the Enquirer

of this morning contains [sic] the facts as I suppose.

  I go to Portsmouth Tuesday; speak there Wednesday evening,

and at Jackson Thursday. Thence I shall push for my darlings

at Delaware, reaching there, I suppose, [on] the afternoon train

from Columbus Friday.--Love and kisses.

                       Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                              CINCINNATI, August 19, 1872.

  MY DARLING:--. . .  Here, Davis is reconciled and things

look better. Shiff told me he was for me; Ferguson, Jones,

and other Democrats of note, ditto. Reason, like me; hate the

Enquirer; and Banning's politics as bad as mine.

                       Affectionately,

                                                        H.

  MRS. HAYES.









<B>212          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Sunday, [August] 25.--Meetings [at Portsmouth and Jack-

son] good. Grant gains; Greeley loses steadily. I now think

Grant's election quite certain.

  August 29, 1872-- I left Delaware this evening, intending to

go to Cincinnati to enter on my canvass. But as I was starting

I got an alarming letter from Birch about Uncle's health.  I

staid at Platt's all night.

  August 30. -- To Fremont, find Uncle better. Will go Monday

to my canvass.

  August 31. -- Today Uncle tells me:  "It was a gloomy night

when you were born.  After your father's death your mother

had a dreadful fever and was very weak when you were born.

It was in the west room of the old house which stands on William

Street, north side, east of Sandusky, or Main.  I went for Dr.

Lamb.  Dr. Hills was your mother's regular physician, but Dr.

Lamb was most convenient to find.  Arcena (Mrs. Wasson) was

sick.  It was about nine or ten o'clock in the evening.  It was

rather cool for the season (October 4) and I built a fire. Mrs.

Smith, a most excellent nurse, mother of Smith of Marion, at-

tended to your mother. I paid Dr. Lamb $3.50 for his job."



                 CINCINNATI, (Sunday), September 8, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I have stood the first and worst week's work

well.  The result here is more doubtful than I supposed.  The

Greeley strength is in my district. I feel it the truth that Greeley

ought to be beaten, and I strike him in every speech. This drives

the Greeley men from me.  I shall not be surprised at defeat.

But we gain steadily.  I think Grant's election almost sure.

Four weeks, and I am free.  I enjoy this.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                           CINCINNATI, September 15, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:-- I am getting on finely with my canvass.  The

most distant and difficult points have all been visited. I have









             <B>CANVASS FOR CONGRESS--1872          213</B>



learned one new thing, how to make short speeches answer every

purpose. My health is good and gaining.

  I can't tell how we shall come out.  The chances are I shall

be beaten. Our press has demoralized us more in this city than

anywhere else.  The Commercial is against us, and Hassaurek

with the Volksblatt is now out against us.  I shall get compli-

mentary votes from Democrats but probably not enough to save

the result. But Grant gains steadily, and his election I [am]

confident about.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                             CINCINNATI, September 18, 1872.

  MY DEAR UNCLE:--I am glad to know by your letter of the

16th that you are so well and comfortable. I am also very lucky.

You know that I had a fever, which it is difficult to throw off,

in such a work as I am in now. I stay a good part of the time

at Dr. Davis' where the health part of my duties are [is] care-

fully attended to.

  I shirk a good deal and sham a good deal, so that I am doing

apparently as much as anybody.  We gain steadily, but I am not

at all confident of my own election.  Hassaurek and his news-

paper are out against us squarely.  The scamp was waiting  for

a high price, and our folks refused to pay it. Hence his course.

There is a general belief also that the "Sands clique" are cheat-

ing by colonizing loose voters out of my district into Eggleston's.

This may be true to a limited extent.

                           Sincerely,

                  CINCINNATI, September 22, 1872. Sunday.

  MY DEAR UNCLE: -- Only two weeks more of this thing!

Greeley's foolish speeches must surely weaken him, and destroy

what chances he had. He left yesterday for Louisville, and must

continue to make mistakes.

  We had a great and successful meeting last night. addressed









<B>214          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



by Butler, Hawley, Logan, and Delano. I think we are gaining

and yet in the city the chances seem to be rather against us.

There are two daily German papers of largest circulation against

us, and the Enquirer and Commercial.  They are against me,

as well as the rest of the ticket. . . .

  I am spending somewhat more than I intended, but as it is

"positively the last time," I suppose I must stand it.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

                           CINCINNATI, September 28, 1872.

  MY  DEAR WEBB:--I was glad to get your first letter from

Cornell today. You must [not] accuse me of acting for political

effect if you see it in the newspapers. I lost it soon after I read

it, and as whatever a candidate's name is connected with gets

published, possibly your letter will share that fate. It was a

genuine freshman's letter. A page or two of rushes and the like

and a few lines about studies. But that is what I want. Letters

that show me just what you are thinking of and what you enjoy.

           I am much better than when you were here and now

enjoy the canvass. I have meetings every night. We are gaining,

we think, on our adversaries, and we may beat them. But I still

think that in this locality we shall come out second best. In

the State we are confident of flooring Mr. Greeley. . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                  Your father,

                                                           H.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

      Ithaca.

                            CINCINNATI, September 29, 1872.

  MY DEAR UNCLE: -- Another week has gone pleasantly enough.

The canvass has been rather a jolly one notwithstanding the

gloomy local prospects because of the obvious fact that we are

gaining constantly. Our meetings have been good and spirited.

Greeley's visit was an advantage. The best people take an un-

usually lively interest in the election. Altogether I am reconciled.

  In health I feel well, but shall not get my strength back until

after it is over. . . .

                           Sincerely,

  October 4, 1872. Cincinnati, Brock's Hall. -- Today I am

fifty years old. My darling came down with our dear little

Fanny last night and both are now in the room -- Lucy lying on

the lounge and little Fanny busy washing the articles on the

washstand. A happy family. My last speech of the campaign

will be made today, tonight rather, at Cumminsville. I prefer

to be elected, but am not at all solicitous about it. I don't want

to go to Washington. The chances are about even, as I see them

today. It has been a pleasant canvass. Some treachery in our

camp. But good people encourage me.

  October 6. Sunday.--Heard Rev. D. H. Moore preach his

first sermon at Trinity and dined with him at Dr. John Davis'

with Lucy and little Fan. Little Fanny was asked if she would

stay with Dr. Davis all night. She said she wanted to stay with

Mamma, "But I will stay with Uncle John if it will benefy him."



                               CINCINNATI, October 6, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- The work of the canvass is finished, and I am

through with it pretty creditably and in good health. I still ex-

pect defeat. Of course, I would prefer it to be otherwise, but

it is of small consequence. I look for victories in the State and

in other States.

  Lucy came down with Fanny a few days ago. Little Fanny is

in her best condition, healthy and good-tempered. Her accident

was a very dangerous one. She hung by one foot in the stirrup,

the pony dashing among the trees. Her escape was a marvel.

She was left senseless several hours. But no fever followed, and

no serious harm. I look at her with a feeling of gratitude. She

is so improved and has such an affectionate disposition.

  I doubted at one time whether my fever would allow me to

go through. But I am now about over it.









<B>216          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Lucy will return to Ross County in a few days. I may not

come up until about the middle of the month.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                               CINCINNATI, October 9, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE:--You will know of our Waterloo defeat in

Cincinnati long before this reaches you. It is complete and over-

whelming; so complete that it leaves no personal sting. In fact,

my share in it is rather pleasant. I am largely ahead of my

ticket. At the close of the polls my election was conceded at the

Enquirer office.  I met no one who doubted it.  I seemed to be

the only man who appreciated the load.  And I was surprised at

its size. The slips I enclose show how well it leaves my record.

I have no regrets.  The result of the Presidential business is

most happy.  We can rejoice over that.

  We will not come up until next week sometime.  Health good.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  October 19, 1872.  Fremont.--Getting slowly rid of the ef-

fects of my intermittent fever.  It attacked me about August 10.

Took quinine, checked it; speaking to mass meetings brought it

back and so till now. Have lost fifteen pounds in flesh.

  Was beaten in the canvass [by] 1502 votes. Did not expect

nor greatly desire an election.  We were beaten worse in Cin-

cinnati than even I expected. But the result in my district justi-

fied the claims of those who insisted that I ought to run to help

the ticket.  They said I would strengthen it a thousand votes at

least, and would also run ahead of the ticket. The First District,

Mr. Eggleston's, was about four or five hundred votes worse for

us than the Second District, mine. But in the result Eggleston

was beaten 3569, or 2067 more than I was. So it is said I helped

my ticket one thousand more than he did and ran five to six

hundred ahead of my ticket besides. Well, it is of no conse-

quence; but I am glad it is so.

  October 23, 1872. -- Lucy tells me that when I was in the war,

Birch, then eight years old, used to say: "If Papa should be

killed, what do you think you could do? Could you teach school,

or would you do sewing for a living?"!!

  October 31, 1872. -- Daniel Austin, the oldest of the Austins

of Cleveland, visits Uncle today.  He says his grandfather, Cap-

tain Daniel Austin, served in the Old French War and was taken

prisoner and imprisoned in one of the French West India islands.

While there it was the custom of the prisoners to send out one

of their number to beg.  They got beer and other things from

the inhabitants. Often more beer was sent than was used. The

prisoners would throw it away. They feared the people would

not send enough if it was known that too much had been given.

Captain Austin never felt so mean as when he was on one of

these begging tours.

  Cincinnati, November 3, 1872.-- Returned last night.  Have

just written a letter declining to respond to the second toast,

"The President of the United States," at the banquet of the

Society of the Army of the Cumberland on the 21st at Dayton.

But I feel like not sending it.  I would enjoy  the occasion.

Can't I get up a short, spicy talk?  The office and the man who

fills it. We think of the office, of the men who have filled it, and

[of] the man who now fills it.

  November 4, 1872.-- Confident of the election of General

Grant tomorrow; so confident that my only interest is as to the

details of the result.





                             CINCINNATI, November 6, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I hope the rainy, raw weather has left you

well enough to enjoy the great victory of yesterday. It is, in-

deed, a happy and glorious result. It was amazing to see how the

immense crowd at the Gazette office stood in the mud, enjoying

the news as it poured in from eight to eleven o'clock. . . .

                           Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                   R.B. HAYES.









<B>218          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  November 7, 1872. -- The official result of the election shows

that personally I need not feel much hurt.

  At the October election I ran 655 ahead of my ticket in the

city. In the country precincts I generally ran from five to ten

ahead, but in Cumminsville, the place of residence of my op-

ponent, General Banning, he ran 139 ahead, so that in the coun-

try he was 82 ahead. This left me ahead in the district 573

votes.

  Again, in the other district of the county--the First -- Mr.

Eggleston was much worse beaten than I was. The difference

between the districts at former elections was about five hundred

--not quite that.  At this election, Eggleston was beaten [by]

3569 [votes]; Hayes [by] 1502. An improvement of over fifteen

hundred for my district--the Second.

  Again, at the Presidential election, Grant beat Eggleston in

the First District about 700 votes; while I beat Grant in the

Second District 464 votes.

  Altogether I personally made a good run and no doubt brought

a better vote to the whole ticket than it would have received

if I had declined. But what a victory for General Grant! It

is simply "prodigious"!





            LONGVIEW, NEAR CINCINNATI, November 8, 1872.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--I came out to the asylum last evening to

see your Uncle Joe, and the talk of your warm friend Colonel

Robinson reminds me that I ought to write to my lads.  Birch-

ard's letter written the day before he was a ninteen-year-old

came to hand yesterday.

  The election is simply glorious.  We  gained in Ohio very

largely over the October election. We gained also in Hamilton

County. But in my district it is some satisfaction that Grant did

not run as well as I did in October. I beat him about three

hundred votes. It is well to beat somebody!

  Now, my son, I need not urge you to give solid and honest

work to your studies. Whatever the line of business you pur-

sue in life, training that hard study will give you will be of

service to you. Try to understand fully whatever you go over.









             <B>LIFE IN CINCINNATI--1872          219</B>



Thoroughness is the vital thing. More important than study,

however, is honesty, truthfulness, and sincerity.  Resolve to

abide by these under all circumstances, and keep the resolution.

Such a character as you will then have will make you honored

and happy, and your parents proud of and fond of you.

  A little too much sermon! from

                   Your affectionate father,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  November 19.  Cincinnati.--Uncle Scott Cook during this

visit at Chillicothe (November 9-18) told me something about

Grandfather Isaac Cook and others of his line which I did not

know before. Judge Isaac Cook was at the Greenville treaty

negotiations by Wayne in 1795.

  The horse disease [epizootic] here has driven almost all of

the horses from the streets. Their places are supplied by oxen,

boys, and men with waggons and the like. Last night we arrived

from Chillicothe. Lucy with Fanny, Scott, and the nurse, Win-

nie, walked from the depot, Plum and Central Avenue below

Third, up to this point, 61 Mound. I got two boys to take my

traps, at several trips, for twenty-five cents each piece ($1.25).

  Aunt Phoebe thinks Grandfather Cook was in a ship as a middy

or sailor boy of some sort in the closing part of the War of the

Revolution. Probably an error.

  At Uncle Scott Cook's saw a history of the "Last War with

Great Britain" by Samuel R. Brown, published in 1815 or 1816 at

Auburn, New York., in two small volumes. The author seems to

have been with the army. He says he saw one hundred and fifty

holes made by the cannon of the British in the pickets of Fort

Stephenson [at Fremont] after Croghan's defense. The pickets

were ten feet high; a blockhouse at each corner, etc., etc. The

only one killed on our side in the assault on the fort was a boy

of fourteen, who defiantly raised his arm above the pickets. It

was torn off by a cannon shot.

  Uncle Scott described his Uncle Joel Cook's gallantry at Tip-

pecanoe. He was a captain of the Fourth Regulars. His com-









<B>220          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



mand was [a] fine set of fellows in excellent discipline. He was

a large, broad-shouldered, strongly-built man, of great power,

and as brave as a lion.  Uncle Matthew Scott Cook was intro-

duced to General Harrison about 1837. He said to him, "Your

Uncle Joel was as brave a man as ever lived." Captain Joel

Cook took off his boots and pants and slept in his tent. When

the unexpected attack was made by the savages he couldn't find

his pants.  He pulled on his boots, buckled his sword around

him, and in his shirt and boots with a carbine he rushed out and,

at the head of his men, charged the Indians three times--the

last time with such effect that they did not return. As he stood

near a tree at one of the fires a volley of the Indians cut his

clothing in several places and many hit the tree he was leaning

against. Once he pushed forward with his orderly; a large

Indian stood erect and met him with a war club. He fired his

carbine and thought the Indian fell; he leaped forward, when

he saw the Indian with a large club raised ready to strike him.

Captain Cook grasped his carbine with the right hand holding the

barrel just in front of the lock and the left near the muzzle, and

raising it sprang at the Indian.  The savage struck a blow which

was received on the carbine, bending it badly and cutting off

a finger of the captain's.  The captain with his carbine clubbed

killed the Indian at a blow. His orderly ran and scalped the

warrior.

  November 20, 1872.--I have a talent for silence and brevity.  I

can keep silent when it seems best to do so, and when I speak

I can, and do usually, quit when I am done. This talent, or

these two talents, I have cultivated. Silence and concise, brief

speaking have got me some laurels, and, I suspect, lost me some.

No odds.  Do what is natural to you, and you are sure to get

all the recognition you are entitled to.

  Soon after his marriage to Margaret Scott at Shippensburg,

Pennsylvania, Judge Isaac Scott moved to the western part of

Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.  There he probably taught school.

He made the acquaintance of General Neville who owned lands

in Ohio.  About 1793 (?) Judge Scott moved to the neighbor-

hood of Chillicothe as the agent of General Neville to sell lands.

  November 24, 1872.--I attended the Literary Club last night.

An agreeable gathering of about twenty gentlemen, generally

youngish men. There were only two or three present of those 

who were members twenty years [ago]. John W. Herron, Pat-

rick Mallon, and General M. F. Force were members  in 1850

and were present last night. Four of the old members.

  Fremont, December 1, 1872.--I came up from Cincinnati via

Columbus last Monday to take my Thanksgiving dinner with

Uncle. At Columbus I remained at Laura's Monday night.

The chief delight was the birth of a son to Fanny Fullerton.  A

fine little seven-pounder, to be called, after his grandfather,

William Platt Fullerton.

  Arriving here Tuesday evening, Uncle was in his usual winter

health, with perhaps a little severer cough.  Cousin Mary Birch-

ard here.  Ruddy and Sarah Jane making his household.

  Friday, December 29.-- Went with the excursion to Lima,

celebrating the completion of the Lake Erie and Louisville Rail-

road to that point.  It was gratifying to see Dr. Rawson, the in-

defatigable, persevering, courageous president, at last successful.

Ffteen years or more he has given to the work. Without money,

in spite of every discouragement and obstacle, he has pushed for-

ward his enterprise.  Now it is in a condition to earn money and

extend itself. Last night (30th) I spoke to a meeting in Birchard

Hall in favor of voting one hundred and thirty-four thousand

dollars to aid in building a new route from Chicago to New

York and Dr. Rawson's Lake Erie and Louisville Railroad to-

wards the northeast. The meeting was not large but a good feel-

ing prevailed and I hope the vote will be carried by the requisite

two-thirds majority.

  Uncle proposes that Sarah Jane Grant shall build a good

dwelling for herself and mother on Birchard Avenue in front of

Diamond Park and that he will make his home with them and

give up Spiegel Grove to me next summer or fall. I think

favorably of it, but must consult Lucy and reflect on it. I sus-

pect it will be better for Uncle than his present arrangement and

best for all concerned.

  I used an anecdote to illustrate how railroad companies divide









<B>222          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



with produce dealers, manufacturers, and others the benefits of

their business when there is no competition. Tom and Billy, two

brothers, slept in the same bed. One evening their mother heard

a difficulty between them and called to know the cause. "Why,

Billy wants half of the bed, and says he means to have it."

"Well, Tom," replied the mother, "that's fair; there are only

two of you and half of the bed is his share." "Oh, but mother,

you don't understand. He wants his half of the bed right in the

middle and that doesn't leave enough for me on either side of

him."

  "Let all of us take a fair start."--One of Uncle's stories

of the congregation of wreckers and their pastor: News came

that a wreck was to happen soon. The congregation to a man

arose and began a rush for the door. The clergyman, whose

pulpit was distant from the door, called to them: "Stop. In the

name of the Lord, I command you to stop." All paused. The

preacher descended slowly into the aisle and then taking long

strides to the door said, "Let us all take a fair start."

  I estimate that if the Chicago and New York Air Line Rail-

road is built, running as it does from the east to the west line

of Sandusky County, and if the Lake Erie and Louisville Rail-

road is completed to Cleveland so as to be a through line, that the

valuation of these roads will be such as to pay one-tenth of all

of the taxes in Sandusky County.

  December 3, 1872. -- The vote in Sandusky township in favor

of the railroad loan of one hundred and thirty-four thousand

dollars to aid in extending Dr. Rawson's road east, the Lake

Erie and Louisville, and the Chicago and New York Air Line

was as follows, ten in the city No; forty-one in township No.

  Today Sam Young, of Toledo, came over to see Birchard and

Wilson about buying their one-hundred-and-sixty-acre tract, east

side, for the Columbus and Toledo Railroad. He was willing to

pay seven hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars per acre for

the whole tract. He finally offered for the part back of the

Hone tract eight hundred dollars per acre. This is the least

valuable part of the tract. Finally, he talked as if he would give

one thousand dollars and on the way home with me dropped









             <B>LIFE IN CINCINNATI--1872          223</B>



a word or two which seemed to imply that twelve hundred dollars

might be paid.  Wilson seemed to feel like yielding to Young's

views. I insisted then that every acre was worth two thousand

dollars. Young spoke of this as a high figure, but I think it is

worth it.

  A grant of the right of way is made to the Toledo and Western

Company in case it builds on it in three years. The Toledo and

Western build on another route. Can that company now trans-

fer its right of way to another company, there being no con-

sideration for the grant except the construction of the railroad?

  What is the limit of the right of a railroad to condemn for

depot and business purposes? May they condemn wharf prop-

erty? How much may they condemn for depots?

  A grant to a company that is never organized--is it not void?

The company is only a company with a certificate of incorpora-

tion.

  Cincinnati, December 5, 1872.--Returned via Toledo  from

Fremont.  The most intelligent person on fire insurance I have

met was on the cars from Toledo to Cincinnati; a general agent

(whose name I lost) for adjusting losses.

  Uncle George Warren -- we call him "Uncle" -- an old rather

queer man, a measurer by trade, now approaching eighty, is low.

Lucy visits him, kisses him, talks cheerily to him, makes him

happy, and is happy herself in making him and "Aunty" War-

ren happy.

                     CINCINNATI, OHIO, December 18, 1872.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I hear from the boys that they will be at

Fremont on Saturday.  We can hardly come before the day after

Christmas. Would do so if it was very desirable.

  I had a good long talk with Otis [of Chicago] yesterday. He

was full of his sensible observations. He avoided politics. He

is not sore, but don't like the subject. The plans I gave him for

myself--going to Fremont and what I would do there--he

very strongly approved as the true course for me. He is very

prosperout. His rents are over seventy thousand dollars a year.

. . .            Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                  R. B. HAYES.

  Fremont, Ohio, December 26, 1872. -- Uncle Birchard says:--

"Good Hunt was a humorous, witty Indian chief (a lower chief)

of the Senecas. No Indian could understand interest. They

could not see how money would produce money, how it would

grow.  I tried to make them understand it, when I would furnish

them money on their assignment of an annuity before it was due.

But they couldn't understand it. Once I sold Good Hunt a

shilling's worth of tobacco. He took it, and in payment he

placed on the counter a sixpence. I said that is not enough.

With a queer twinkle in his eye he replied, 'It will grow; you

know how money grows.'

  "The Indians, the Senecas, were far more honest than white

men. I have had my store full of them all night, no one awake

to watch them, and never lost anything. The chiefs always saw

that their debts were paid. If an Indian died, it was believed

he could not enter the happy hunting-grounds until their [his]

debts were paid on earth."

  So strongly does Uncle feel on the Indian question, that while

he admires Sheridan and Crook more than most men, he is al-

most disposed to condemn them for their Indian policy.  He is

devoted to Grant for his course towards the Indians.

  Fremont, December 29, 1872.--This has been an unusually

long and severe winter.  November was like a winter month.

The thermometer, which hangs on one of the pillars of the north

porch, has shown the mercury lower than ever before since it

hung there. Sunday, December 22, at breakfast time, 12 degrees

below; 23d, it was 7 degrees below zero, and below zero at that

hour four days-- at A. M. 8 o'clock.

  December 30, 1872. -- Our wedding day, twenty years ago!  A

happy day. Darling is handsomer than she was then, with a

glorious flow of friendly feeling and cheerfulness, genuine

womanly character, a most affectionate mother, a good, good

wife. How I do love her! What a lucky man I was and am!

  Snow, six inches and good sleighing for more than a week

past, and a prospect of its lasting a week longer.

  Uncle spends a large part of the time reading Sunday-school

books. He says, "They are to me a sort of 'soothing syrup.'









             <B>SPIEGEL GROVE--1873          225</B>



They require no thought, no exertion to understand; they are

printed in good type and are convenient to handle." His health

is such that an exciting tale, or a book of solid qualities, would

disturb his nerves and weary him.

  December 31, 1872.-- Last night a quiet snow fell to the depth

of perhaps eight inches, making the total depth now on the

ground about fifteen inches. The best snow and the best sleigh-

ing I ever knew in Ohio.  The snow lodged on the trees of the

grove as it fell in the still air until now the grove has a beautiful

white, feathery powder covering it which is charming and won-

derful.

  January 2, 1873. --Uncle says that Charles L. Mead in 1859

looked, acted, talked, and walked almost exactly like my father.

His portrait will do for a picture of my father.

  January 5.-- The mild weather of the third melted a good

deal of the snow and filled the cisterns and small streams.

Enough snow was left for good sleighing in the woods and on

shaded roads.  The ice makes an excellent foundation for the

snow now falling. It will make capital sleighing again. Ther-

mometer 27 degrees. No such drouth as that of the last three

years. Wells and even springs give out.

  January 8.-- Spiegel Grove, under the great oaks, was a

favorite camping place for the Indians until they left for the

West. Afterwards the gypsies camped occasionally under the

oaks in front of the house until Uncle occupied it first in 1863.

  The hollow at the head of the ravine south of the house,

when I first knew it [in] 1860, seemed to have a spring and

water trickled down the ravine a good part of the year. The

run that crosses Buckland Avenue, this side of Fennimore's, was

a permanent living stream, with fish in it twenty-five or thirty

years ago.

  Uncle began to build this house August 22, 1859. Enclosed

and roofed it that year. Moved into it in the spring of 1863.

He put a barrel in the ravine, supposing he had a permanent

spring. Water ran from it all of the year. But clearing and

    15









<B>226          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ditching the country has dried up these surface water streams

and springs.

  January 14. -- Uncle says his Spiegel Grove house is the first

in which gas fixtures were placed in Fremont.

  Fremont, January 15, 1873.--Uncle is seventy-two years old

today. Two years ago I had a superstitious dread as his

seventieth birthday approached, fearing that he would not live

to seventy. He was in poor health, suffering much, and his

temper somewhat querulous. Now he is in possession of his

accustomed hopeful and cheerful temper and is able to enjoy

himself as he did years ago. Then he was vexed when I spoke

of his birthday, didn't want it known. Nothing could be more

different than his feelings now. No one mentioned it until noon.

I then spoke of his former vexation about it and asked him if he

knew today was his birthday. He laughed pleasantly and said

he had been thinking of it for two or three weeks and wondered

if we knew it. Sarah Jane made a pretty cushion cover and put

it on a new cushion for his chair. The new cushion was in the

chair when we came up from dinner. He saw it as he went to

the chair. Mrs. Grant came in to enjoy the scene; altogether a

happy thing. A happy birthday!

  January 16. -- Uncle says: "Your father was the best busi-

ness man I ever knew. George Grant, next; Cyrus Austin, who

was drowned, next."



                         FREMONT, OHIO, January 17, 1873.

  MY DEAREST:. . . We have talked over the proposed emi-

gration. We are to come about April 15 to May 1. To be

visitors as usual until the new house is finished. This is ex-

pected to be about September first. We are to store our traps in

a new storehouse to be built out back for that purpose. When

we take possession the whole house passes into our hands ex-

cept Uncle's chamber and sleeping room, which we may use as

it stands but not to overhaul and change. Well, I say, agreed to

it all with all my heart.

                       Affectionately,

  MRS. HAYES.                                             R.









             <B>SPIEGEL GROVE--1873          227</B>



                     LONGVIEW ASYLUM, January 25, 1873.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We came out to spend Sunday with Uncle

Joe and go back Monday.  We are all well. . . . I have

been looking at some of the doctor's vines on walls and trees.

The Virginia creeper, the Chinese wistaria and the English ivy

soon make an old tree a beautiful object. I would like to ex-

periment with your dead Spanish oak. If you will let it stand

a year or so longer I hope something can be made of it as a

supporter of vines which will in time make it as ornamental as

it was when it was alive. So spare that tree one season more

and let us see.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



  January 28, 1873. Tuesday. -- Now that it is decided that I

go to Fremont and make a home in Spiegel Grove, I give some

thought to its advantages and its possible improvements. It is a

place of great advantages. As Uncle says, one may there "dis-

play the light of science." I do not expect to make many changes.

But if additions to the house are required, what shall they be?

One would like (1) a large parlor, (2) [a] library, (3) a dining-

room and a hall and [a] veranda.  With me, the best part of the

present house is its veranda.  But I would enlarge it.  I want a

veranda with a house attached!  A  plain,  bracketted style,

quaker-like mansion, with a wide, hospitable veranda, generous

halls, and dining-rooms. [Here follow many details and tenta-

tive plans of desired changes and improvements in the house.]

  February 3.--Last night I attended a full, good meeting of

the Literary Club. Mr. Leaman read an essay of great interest

on Spiritualism. He evidently believes in the phenomena, or

some of them, commonly called mesmeric. He seems to sub-

scribe to the view that there is a condition of the system in

which one may perceive or know without the aid of the senses

and beyond the powers of seeing or hearing. This condition

he thinks, some, perhaps all, persons can place themselves in.

No one has power over another, etc., etc.









<B>228          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



   Cincinnati, February 6. -- I hear that Uncle Birchard has an-

other bad turn. I shall go up in the morning. Today I got

from Mr. Dexter the manuscript diary of David Zeisberger,

presented to the Historical Society of Ohio by Judge Lane.







                         FREMONT, OHIO, February 9, 1873.

   DEAREST:--Uncle had a good night's rest and is better.  He

does not expect to recover but he has some chance. He coughs

very little--less than usual, but it gives him great pain in the

small of the back. He is cheerful, affectionate, and often humor-

ous. He occasionally speaks of religion. He says he is not

much of a Christian but believes and trusts in the Lord Jesus.

He said to me, "If I am anywhere near as good as your mother

was, I shall see her very soon."  He often says, "I am so glad

you came." . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                                        H.

  MRS. HAYES.



  Fremont, February 10, 1873.--On Friday, 7th, I left Cincin-

nati at 7 A. M. for this place and reached here at 6 P. M.  As

I had heard nothing from him later than Sunday eve, or Monday

morning, and as I always have an understanding with near

relatives that "no news is good news," I was confident that

Uncle must be getting on well; so much so that I doubted the

propriety of coming and expected to hear that I was again on

hand when there was no danger. As I trudged through the mud

I was thinking of this, but near the grove I met Rutherford with

Old Whitey driving down to the depot after me. He told me

Uncle was much worse and that they were afraid he would not

be able to speak to me or even to recognize me. Much shocked,

I put my valise into the buggy and hurried to the house. I found

Uncle Birchard wholly unconscious and in great pain, suffering

chiefly in his head. . . .

  We thought it probable he would die during the night. But

in the morning, Saturday, he awoke quiet and rational.          He









             <B>SARDIS BIRCHARD'S DECLINE--1873          229</B>



recognized me, was cheerful and affectionate, and yet so weak

and his pulse so feeble that we thought he was about to die

and so told him.  He spoke of a few things he wanted attended

to in business matters, Miller's increase of salary, etc., etc., and

about the disposition of one part of his property, which as his

will stands would fall to me in bulk. He had all leave the room

while he talked to me. He said: --

  "I am so glad you came -- so glad. You have been a good boy;

you always minded me. I fear you are not quite so correct in

your religion as I wish you were. I know you are not religious.

Always take care to treat Sarah Jane well. She has saved my

life and I feel towards her as towards a daughter. She is to

have my diamond pin.  You will have property enough.  You

will have also my watch and books and everything, but I would

like to have when there are little things you don't want--I

would like presents made to many of my friends.  I thought of

giving my pin to Waite. I always valued his friendship. I

want to give more to the town. The Boalt tract will sometime

be worth twenty thousand dollars. When it is I want the town

to have for its benefit five thousand dollars.  Whatever Buck-

land, Dr. Stilwell, and you think best."

  Occasionally he prayed briefly.  He had no fear of death, but

rather desired it as a refuge from so much pain.  "If I am as

good as your mother, I will soon see her, soon be with her."

He has a delusion that his "loss of mind," as he calls it, was

"the apoplex" . . .  His sight and memory are both bad.

But he remembers his suffering during that awful Friday night

when he was so wild.  He says it was beyond anything he ever

thought of.  It was as if his bones were grinding up. . . .

  Wednesday, February 12.--Uncle had a good night's rest.

We had no one to sit up with him.  He sees fewer visions.  A

day or two ago he saw veils, saw dust floating in the air, sheep

running and leaping, flowers and other beautiful objects. Now

he is free from these sights and is no doubt somewhat better in

all respects. . . .

  Thursday,  February  13, 1873. -- "You may  consult  Buck-

[land], Haynes, Bushnell, Stilwell, and Wilson as to how to









<B>230          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



spend ten thousand dollars for the benefit of the town to be taken

from the Boalt tract when you can sell it for twenty thousand

dollars; at least ten thousand dollars, perhaps three-fourths of

it, after expenses, taxes, etc."

  Tuesday, February 18.--. . .  The late rain and the thaw

today and yesterday are raising the water in the river. We hear

the roar of the water rushing over the milldams in Ballville.

The windows in Uncle's room, some of them, are thumping as if

the wind struck them in waves. The inmates of the house say

this never occurs except in time of a full river. Can this be so?

If so, the explanation of it?



          FREMONT, OHIO, Sunday A. M., February 23, 1873.

  MY  DARLING: --. . .      Uncle slowly improves--very

slowly. . . . I have said nothing about coming home, but

have hoped to be able to leave him the last of this week. I am

not sure of it now. The fear that I might have to stay a long

time has led me to urge you to get ready to come up sooner than

you intended, thinking it might be best for you to come before

I returned. I only say now that perhaps it will be best for you

to come soon.  How do you feel about coming now? . . .

                         Affectionately,

  MRS. HAYES.                                             R.



  February 27, 1873.  Thursday. -- Uncle is so much better that

he can sit up the most of the time, and for twenty-four hours has

had no serious pains.

  March 3. Monday. -- For three days the thermometer has

been at about the freezing point.

  Saturday last I went with James B. Luckey and his father,

A. W. Luckey, to look at lands near Toledo. James had bought

twenty acres about a mile from the river for twenty-five hundred

dollars. I agreed to take an undivided half of it and make the

payments. It is on the road that runs eastwardly from the river

below the Hone tract. We also agreed to take ten acres on

south side of same road, half a mile or less from the river for

thirty-five hundred dollars--one-third cash, balance in one and









             <B>LAND PURCHASES--1873          231</B>



two years. I also agreed to take the Gleason farm at nine thou-

sand dollars, one-third cash, balance in one and two years. It

contains one hundred and three acres, is cut by Lake Shore

Railroad two miles east of Brown Hotel. . . . I expect to

share these lands, my interest in them, with Wilson, Dr. Davis,

or J. T. Webb. I will retain either a third or a quarter interest.

  Cincinnati, March 6, 1873. -- Tuesday, fourth, left Fremont via

Toledo. At Elmore joined by James B. Luckey and Augustus

W. Luckey. At Toledo we met Colonel H. N. Howland, real

estate agent. . . .  I told Colonel Howland to contract for

me for about twenty-two acres on Woodville road for twenty-

five hundred dollars or better if possible. Left Luckey to com-

plete contract for one-hundred-and-three-acre farm. Reached

61 Mound Street at 11 o'clock.

  [Fremont, March 20].--Friday, March 14, General Knapp

came to Cincinnati to visit us. Saw Farney's pictures of pork

packing; the new library room; the book of birds (Audubon),

the largest and finest edition and one of the best copies.

  Saturday, 15th, we rode out to Walnut Hills. Force at tea

with us. In the morning, too late to start, I got a dispatch from

Miss Sarah [Grant] that Uncle was again bad. At 9:45 P. M.

took train to Clyde; reached there, after a comfortable night on

the cars, at 8 A. M.; took breakfast at Widow Pierce's tavern.

A boy drove me over, eight miles, in one hour, against a fierce,

cold west wind, Sunday morning.  Found Uncle much better.

Is now doing pretty well. . . . He gains strength slowly.

  Yesterday, Wednesday, 19th, with Mr. Cochran and a digger,

marked out the cellar for Sarah's new house.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 19, 1873.

  MY DARLING:--Uncle has had no return of severe headache,

but occasionally, for an hour or two, suffers considerably. He

is much stronger than when I was here before. . . .

  Yesterday we had a good steady spring rain all day. I spent

it largely rummaging over and arranging old papers and letters.

Among other interesting ones I found your first letters to me









<B>232          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



after I went up to Camp Chase. They were very good and

affectionate.  Pleasant reading now.  Also a pencil list with

residences of the wounded you visited at Middletown. That

was our golden age.

  Anna Dickinson will lecture here tomorrow night. She is

more of an event here than in Cincinnati and will no doubt, if

the weather is decent, draw a great crowd.

  Take things easy. Be happy. And, more than all, think and

feel your lovingest of your affectionate spouse.

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.





  Fremont, March 23, 1873.--Uncle yesterday deeded to me

his half of the 160-acre tract in East Toledo. We both think it

is now worth one hundred thousand dollars, and that it will

rapidly increase in value. It will be worth in my opinion five

thousand dollars per acre in less than ten years, and ten thousand

dollars per acre (cut up into city lots of course) in less than

twenty years. The value of my share in 1883, say, five hundred

thousand dollars and in 1893 say one million dollars. But it is

likely to be sold long before those dates.  I will hold on for a

large advance, but will not hold it to the injury of the city.

When the general good of the city requires it to be improved,

if I cannot improve it myself, I will sell to those who can at a

fair price at the time. But before this occurs it will probably

sell for fifty dollars a foot in small parcels. The river in front

of the property is probably over two thousand feet wide. Ac-

cording to the established dock lines, the channel is to remain

over twelve hundred feet wide.  We therefore gain from fifteen

to twenty acres, perhaps twenty-five to thirty in the Maumee.

   March 24.  Fremont.--I am called on by the War Depart-

ment to send a sketch of my military services. I will tomorrow

look up the letter and begin to prepare it. I will first write a

rather full autobiography embracing the war period and from

that make up a shorter sketch for the War Department. I will

begin today and keep at it, a little [at] a time, until it is finished.









             <B>APPOINTED ASSST. TREASURER--1873          233</B>



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 24, 1873.

  MY DARLING: -- We are expecting "the boys" in a day or two,

and then happiness a plenty. It is a great satisfaction to roam

about and plan improvements, mere "castles in Spain," these

lovely spring days. I think we shall enjoy this life exceedingly.

  Uncle is about as usual. He can now walk about his room

a little and sits up the greater part of the day.

  When the boys come I will send you word. You can either

come to stay or to return, as you please. . . . Get your calls

done up the first chance.

  Be happy.  Take cheerful views of all your troubles.         I

wouldn't want an empty house [closed] up, you know.

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.



  March  26.  Wednesday. -- Last night  I was  made for  a

moment anxious by the telegraph boy with a dispatch. Birch

and Webb were on the way from Cornell to spend here the spring

vacation. But it was merely this surprise: "My hearty con-

gratulations upon your appointment as Assistant Treasurer."

I am glad General Grant appointed me. It enables me to decline

an office of profit just as I leave Cincinnati, and so to leave with

a well-rounded political record. But the office I would not take

except as a means of keeping hunger from the door. After what

I have been and had and done, it would be small potatoes to

grasp this crumb. Thanks be given, I am independent of office

for my daily bread!



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 26, 1873.

  MY  DARLING:--Our  big boys arrived safely and in fine

health and spirits this morning, Wednesday, and will remain

two weeks. They may remain until Saturday two weeks. They

of course want to see their mother and little Fanny. You can

come up either the latter part of this week or early next. Send

me a dispatch when you start. . . .

  I have a dispatch from Charlie Turner congratulating me on









<B>234          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



my appointment as Assistant Treasurer. I have no other inti-

mation of the appointment. Of course, you know, I should not

accept. But I rather hope the fact is so. It will give me a chance

to leave Cincinnati declining what is commonly regarded as a

very desirable office.

  We have a painful report, which I fear is true, that George

Taylor was captured and killed in Arizona by the Indians. I

have written to General Crook about it. He has been heard

from by his friends here in the very neighborhood where the

telegraph locates the outrage. Besides, he was engaged survey-

ing land which for ages has been the hated thing by the savages.

But there are many George Taylors, and this may be another

man. His mother does not yet know it, and will not until the

facts are ascertained.

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 27, 1873.

  MY DARLING: -- Mr. Turner is here. Thanks for the letters.

Don't feel otherwise than flattered. It is the most important

office in the West, and the glory of it is that I have an opportunity

to decline a good office! This I do, of course. I see nothing

offensive in the Commercial articles, but some truths that I don't

object to.

  Come up.  We shall be so jolly with you. . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.

Private.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 29, 1873.

  DEAR GENERAL:--Your note of the 25th reached me here

this morning. The nomination was, of course, a complete sur-

prise. If it had been confirmed, various reasons would have

constrained me to decline the appointment. But I want Mr.

Delano and the President to know that, while the office was not

perhaps such an one as I should have sought (if I ever sought









             <B>APPOINTED ASSST. TREASURER--1873          235</B>



such things), it is nevertheless very gratifying to me to receive

such an appointment under such circumstances, and, without

multiplying words, that I appreciate very highly this proof of

their confidence.

  I don't, perhaps, comprehend the crotchet of Mr. Sherman

which stopped the confirmation.

  As the matter now stands, I am not disposed to decide that I

will not accept the office, if it is again tendered to me. It is

probable that I ought not to undertake the duties under existing

circumstances even for a short period, but on that head I simply

do not now decide.

  Thanks for your letter.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P.S.--I shall be detained here a good part of the time for

some weeks by the sickness of my Uncle, Mr. Birchard.--H.

  P.P.S.--I will write Mr. Delano if, or before, any other

action is taken in this matter by me.--H.

  GENERAL B. R. COWAN.



  Fremont, March 30, 1873. Sunday. -- I yesterday had a good

long letter from my old college friend, R. E. Trowbridge (Old

Trow), of Birmingham, Michigan. He sends me letters from

Mr. Levi Bishop and Judge C. I. Walker, of Detroit, gentlemen

who can aid me in collecting books, etc., etc., of the early history

of this region. Their letters are encouraging. Judge Walker's

is especially so. He gives a long resume of Michigan history.

I must write to Judge Walker, telling him I do not propose

authorship, but to collect what I can relating to the early history

of Ohio and particularly of the Sandusky region, and concerning

the Wyandots.

  Lower Sandusky was one of the outlying ports of Detroit,

depending on it; its traders, first French and then English, were

from Detroit. The Wyandots were from Detroit. Captives

taken by the Wyandots, Shawanees, and others, were taken to

Detroit for reward, or ransom, from Lower Sandusky. Peltries

went there; goods came from there.









<B>236          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I want to know about the Neutral Nation whose two villages,

one friendly to the Hurons, the other to the Five Nations, were

on the opposite sides of the River Sandusky, according to tradi-

tion, about 1650, at this point. About the Wyandots, and par-

ticularly about their last great chief, Tarhe, or King Crane.

About the traders, Robbins and Arundle, English, McCormick,

Scotch, and Levallier, French, who are mentioned by the

Moravians as here in 1782. About the name Sandusky, whether

from an English Pole, "Sondowsky," who came over in Queen

Anne's time, and traded in this region about 1720-40, or from

Wyandot  Sah-un-dus-kee, words signifying "water not con-

cealing the ground," or "water in whirlpools," according to dif-

ferent authorities. When was the name first found on the maps

and where? or in books?  Where was the English Fort Sandusky

which was destroyed with its commander, Sergeant ----,  in

1763 in (Pontiac's war)?  The Moravians were here in 1782

four weeks.



                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 2, 1873.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Reaching here last night, I found your letter

of the 26th, forwarded here from Cincinnati.  I have not at any

time believed that the course you took on my confirmation was

owing to hostility to me. The action taken was calculated, al-

though not so intended, to injure me and to wound my feelings,

and frankness requires that I should say that I think you were

in error in your views of duty under the circumstances. But

I assure you that even without your letter I should have felt

confident that you were not actuated in the affair by opposition

to me.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

      Washington, D. C.



  Fremont, April 3, 1873. -- Tuesday, the first, I went to Toledo

with A. W. Luckey and James B. Luckey, and, after looking at

it, bought a tract of fifteen acres belonging to Mrs. W. A. Col-









             <B>LAND PURCHASES--1873          237</B>



lins, wife of the Judge--a daughter and heir of Edward Bissell.

My share is one-half. The price was one thousand dollars per

acre. . . .  It would be very cheap but for the fact that

Forest Cemetery is near it, perhaps forty rods east of it.

  April 13.  Sunday.--This morning Uncle again had a pretty

severe return of his present troubles. . . .  He made addi-

tional dispositions of property. . . .

  Dr. Rawson, Buckland, Bushnell, Drs. Stilwell and Wilson,

Haynes, and myself to decide how to spend the twenty thousand

dollars for the benefit of Fremont.



                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 16, 1873.

  MY DEAREST: -- Uncle is getting back to his former good con-

dition again. In one respect there is a decided gain. He is now

satisfied that we were all right in advising him to let business

alone. He now appears to be quite willing to leave all of his

troubles, details and all, to others. This will make it much more

comfortable for us. . . .

                         Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 17, 1873.

  MY DARLING: -- Uncle is better, little Fanny is better, and the

grass and leaves are brighter and greener. The rain yesterday

was an old-fashioned April shower and starts the vegetation

with a hop, skip, and jump.

  We shall find it pleasanter at the start--I mean this summer

--than we anticipated. I will arrange it so as to send for our

traps and calamities so you can mouse among them soon after

you come out here. . . .

                        Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.



  April 22, 1873.--A remarkable snow-storm this morning.

The mercury is at the freezing point; the snow falling and being









<B>238          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



damp, it clings to the trees giving to the grove a strangely wintry

appearance. Since Saturday, 19th, it has been raw and cold.

Now the look is like mid-winter.

  Saturday I went with Mr. Luckey to look at a large tract of

land about two miles south of Sylvania and about six or seven

west of Toledo. It is for sale at thirty dollars per acre. It has

a thin sandy soil and much of it is low and wet. But it appears

to be easily drainable, and after it is well ditched I think there

will be no trouble on account of water. Mr. Luckey thinks it

will prove to be good farming land, like that in the vicinity of

Bellevue. But I suspect it is too thin and porous and perhaps

underlaid with quicksand. But it is certainly cheap at thirty

dollars. I think that within five years it will be worth at least

one hundred dollars per acre.

   I am now fairly embarked in the business of buying, selling,

and improving real estate. I buy no land except such as I am

interested in, and do not intend to take advantage of people's

necessities. Paying what is now regarded as a fair price, I be-

 lieve the growth of Toledo, with judicious improvement, will

 make purchases sufficiently remunerative.

   Today Uncle decides to give more to Fremont. He will give

the five thousand dollars, specified. . . .  as going to Ober-

lin, to Fremont. This will leave Oberlin with five thousand

dollars only and Fremont with twenty-five thousand dollars.

   April 25. -- Yesterday Uncle signed a deed conveying to his

 executors thirty-five thousand dollars in trust for a free library

 -- not so expressed. The trust is "for the benefit of Fremont

 as his trustees may deem best."





                              FREMONT, OHIO, April 25, 1873.

   DEAR GENERAL:--. . .  I am getting into my new way of

 life and find myself rather too busy, if I am to find any fault

 with it. The business is to buy, improve, and sell real estate

 at Toledo and thereabouts. The gentlemen for and with whom I

 act have invested about one hundred thousand dollars at Toledo

 since I came up and our talk is of drainage, dock lines, streets,









             <B>LAND PURCHASES--1873          239</B>



alleys, roads, filling, and excavating. Pleasant enough it is and

I hope remunerative.

  Another thing is more interesting. Uncle has decided to give

in land about thirty-five or forty thousand dollars to establish

a free library here. Buckland and others with myself will be

trustees. We block it out this way: 1. Seven to ten thousand

dollars for a building -- the ground will come from the town;

2. Ten thousand dollars worth of books to start; 3. The rest,

fifteen to twenty thousand dollars, for a fund. The building also to

be a place for pictures, relics, pioneer doings, etc., etc. I want

your thoughts on all of these things. We will have plenty of

time. The land is not sold and some will not sell readily at our

figures at present. Our hobby will be one of the hobbies I will

run in the library. The two questions are, what sort of a house?

-What shall it be?  And the other, What list of books to begin

with? We are just in the first of it, and shall do nothing for

some time.

  My wife is still at Brock's [Cincinnati]. She will come up as

soon as the weather is warm. As yet it is winter. We shall not

settle until fall. Then we will have a room for you always,

and in the meantime we shall want to see you here as soon as

your summer vacation opens.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.



  April 27.  Sunday.--Yesterday Mr. Luckey  came over, a

good deal troubled. He had lost the purchase of the Cook tract

by yielding to his feelings of indignation at what he regarded as

Cook's meanness in details. The negotiation was broken off on

a difference of seven dollars. This is too bad. But Luckey is

so good a man, and feels so strongly that we are compelled to

acquiesce good-naturedly. . . . A hot temper is not to be

indulged, or trusted in such affairs. He thinks, probably cor-

rectly, that we can pick up small pieces at a less price, more

favorably located. Well let us do it.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 27, 1873.

  MY DARLING:--The Presbyterians had a fine success with

their dedication today. The church is in good taste--is all

paid for, and was filled full.

  We  can enjoy life here, and bring up the little ones in a

quieter and more rational way than was possible with the mode

of life we were leading when the first wife's children were small.

  I have a suspicion that General Knapp paid his own bill at the

Carlisle House. Please ask Mr. Brock to look into it and if he

paid, learn how much.

  I will send two hundred and fifty dollars to Stephenson for you

to use paying debts, etc., etc., and if more is wanted, let me know.

Get what you want and think lovingly of

                       Your affectionate

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.



  April 28.--We ought to organize a Pioneer Society in San-

dusky County and perhaps a Soldiers' Society. The purpose

would be to have at least one social reunion yearly, to collect

historical and biographical recollections, books, pamphlets, and

all printed matter relating to early times and early settlers, letters,

diaries, documents, books of account, and all manuscript matter

ditto, relics, implements, etc., etc. The same as to the war.

  What should be the rule of admission to the Sandusky County

Pioneer Society? How would it do to say, "All who have re-

sided in the county fifty years? All who resided in the county

prior to 1831, and all other citizens interested in the objects of

the society who will pay into the treasury the sum of two dol-

lars." Or, pioneers, all who were born in or came to the county

as long ago as 1830. The children of pioneers? In making lists,

take place and date of birth, place and date of coming into the

county, occupation, military or other public service, church con-

nection; if married woman, maiden name.

  April 30.  Wednesday. -- I went yesterday to Toledo and com-

pleted with Colonel Howland the purchase of seventy-five acres

of Alvah I. Olds next south of our Lewis farm for about









             <B>LAND PURCHASES--1873          241</B>



eighty dollars per acre. . . . Toledo looks well.  All houses

are full. The railroads are scarcely able to do the business of

the city. New dwellings are building in all quarters.

  My interests in and near Toledo are [one-third to one-half in

various tracts of land amounting to a little more than] three

hundred and thirty-six acres, costing one hundred and forty-five

thousand dollars. In fifteen or twenty years, in my opinion, this

property will be worth at least a million of dollars. In ten years

a half million and in five years a quarter of a million.

  May 2. Friday. -- Today Uncle rode out for the first time

since December 11. Dr. Stilwell took charge of him.  He was

very anxious to get out into the open air. He feels that there is

danger of becoming deranged and dreads it very much.  He is

quite nervous at times.  I have a dispatch from Uncle Joe telling

me to meet Lucy at Lima Saturday, the third. Then we will all

be at Fremont, except the two older at Cornell.

  Our return, or rather my return, and our settlement at Fre-

mont will date from May 3, 1873.  I left Fremont for Cincinnati

in 1849 and now come back, having achieved as much as I ex-

pected, or even hoped, by my life in Cincinnati, with kindly feel-

ings towards all the world, to spend the closing years in the

home of my youth, and the favorite resort of my childhood.

  Let me resolve to lead a good and useful life, characterized

by kindness, friendliness, and liberality; taking more care of my

children and their training and culture than ever before, and

loving my darling wife, and contributing more than ever to her

comfort and happiness.
