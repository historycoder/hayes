  HAYES  was nominated for governor in June, 1867.  He

resigned from Congress on the adjournment of Congress

late in July and immediately entered upon his canvass.]





                      SPRINGFIELD, OHIO, August 17, 1867.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I write from here not knowing if I shall

have time to do so at home. I go home to spend Sunday today.

  Thus far all goes pleasantly. Luckily my best speech was to

my best audience, and where I would have preferred it, at Day-

ton. Nobody with me yet. I expect Buck[land] next week.



                          Yours,

                                            R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                    PORTSMOUTH, August 25, 1867, Sunday.

  MY DARLING:--I could not get to Chillicothe today. Had a

great crowd yesterday. In the middle of my speech a terrific

rain-storm broke us up.  At night we had a fine meeting.  "Old

Ben" [Wade] made a glorious negro suffrage [speech], fre-

quently rough, but great.

  Mrs. Buckland is with Buck. We all enjoy it. Spoke at night

three times the last week as well as daily. Am quite hoarse but

it [the hoarseness] wears off entirely as I warm up. Love to

Rud. Oceans to yourself.

                       Affectionately,

                                                      R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                           COLUMBUS, September 29, 1867.

  MY DARLING: -- I am writing from Laura's pleasant home--

the next place to my wife's in homelikeness and comfort.

  I did hope to see you at 383 this morning but to do so would

give me two night rides, one to go and another to get back to the

Reserve. So, tired as I was, I gave it up.

  A pleasant week, this last. I enjoyed Delaware particularly.

I made only a so-so speech there -- not a failure, but not one of

the good ones.  Sorry for that, but couldn't help it.  At Tiffin

and Bucyrus, three hours each had used me up a trifle. I am

better than ever.

                        Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                               CINCINNATI, October 6, 1867.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We are all very well at our old home on

Sixth Street. My last speech of any consequence was made Fri-

day night. One of the best I have made, and particularly with

the best voice.  It was rather queer.  Governor Morton made a

noble speech but [he] could not be heard by half his audience.

I reached them all more easily than ever before.

  It looks well here.  We shall elect our county ticket and do

well for the amendment.  But the Cary affair<B>*</B> is very much

mixed. I shall not be surprised at any result. It has been badly

managed -- very.

  I hope to be with you next Sunday.

  I sent my card to Judge Thurman [the opposing candidate]

when he was here.  He was not in his room.  He afterwards

sent me a note which I prize.  He says: "Whatever the result, it

is a great satisfaction to know that you and I have behaved like

gentlemen and friends."

  Love to the boys and Sarah.

                            Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                              CINCINNATI, October 9, 1867.

  MY DEAR UNCLE: -- You need not be told how much the re-

sult of the election disappoints me. You know I will bear it

cheerfully and with philosophy. It is however a puzzling thing

to decide now what is next to be done. Assuming that I am

beaten, which I do not doubt, I must choose my path anew.  I

will see you and talk it all over soon. No man in my place

would probably have done differently, but the thing is over, and

now for a sensible future. I feel sorry for the boys -- especially

Birch.

  I hope your health is good, and that you will borrow no trou-

ble on account of this.

                           Sincerely,

  S. BIRCHARD.                                 R. B. HAYES.



                             CINCINNATI, October 11, 1867.

  DEAR SMITH:--I am obliged for your letter of yesterday.  It

is to be hoped that the corrections will not upset the apple-cart.

  I am going to Fremont tomorrow. Please send a dispatch

about noon Saturday, stating the majority for me as it then

stands, addressed to S. Birchard, Fremont, Ohio.

                           Sincerely,         R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- If it holds out I shall be at Columbus next week.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

      SECRETARY OF STATE.



                          CINCINNATI, November 17, 1867.

  DEAR S--:--I went to Columbus to get quarters and for noth-

ing else. I did hear General Cox's whole mind, as I suppose,

and I agree with him throughout. That does not include your

ideas as to General D--. I do not hear that he is a candidate

for the adjutant-generalship.   The  pressure idea is foolish

enough.

  Be serene! I'll talk it all up before jumping in.

                           Sincerely,

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,                         R. B. HAYES.

      Columbus, Ohio.

                             COLUMBUS, December 27, 1867.

  MY DARLING:--Am  here waiting for my traps and calami-

ties -- I should say our--which will be here this afternoon and

I hope to get them all in the house tomorrow. The carpets and

other things I wish to get ready to put down and put in; but

really very little in that way can be done without you. I have

an impression we shall feel very homelike here when we do

settle.

  Love to all. I shall come up [to Fremont] in time for din-

ner New Year's day, if not before.

                        Affectionately,

                                                         R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 11, 1868.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I suppose you are entitled to an advance

copy of my inaugural. Here it is. It contains but three days

[ideas]. First, a compliment to Governor Cox; second, advice

against too much legislation; and third, it shows that I still stand

by equal suffrage. It is the shortest ever delivered in Ohio.

  Our new home is most agreeable. I can give you a pleasant

room with an air-tight wood-stove and a bedroom opening into

it, so much like your own that I am sure you would be safe in

health and feel at home. . . .

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 13, 1868.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I now send you another copy of the inau-

gural containing a fourth idea. I found our Democrats foolish

enough to be repealing Ohio's assent to the Fourteenth Amend-

ment. So I put in some words on that head. -- All well.

                           Yours,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          51</B>



                               COLUMBUS, January 17, 1868.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I am enjoying the new office. It strikes me

at a guess as the pleasantest I have ever had. Not too much

hard work, plenty of time to read, good society, etc., etc. . . .

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 3, 1868.

  DEAR UNCLE:--Tell the boys that if nothing occurs to pre-

vent I hope to reach Fremont on the evening train that will ar-

rive Friday evening.

  I send you T. D. Jones' design for a Soldier and Lincoln Mon-

ument. We hadn't money enough to accept this design. It is in

three parts:--(I) At the bottom, the uprising of the people

when Sumter was taken; (2) The surrender of Vicksburg to

Grant; and (3) The bust of Lincoln. I am not sure but pre-

sume you will think it worth express charges and houseroom.

We adopted Jones' bust from this design.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 17, 1868.

  DEAR S-:--I have thought of writing to the friends of

some of the early governors for portraits. Some I am sure I

can get by simply asking -- as McArthur, Trimble, etc., etc. I

merely write for suggestions supposing you may know or may

have done something which would change my idea.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.

  SIR:--I am requested to write you in relation to the va-

cancy in the consular office at Cincinnati, Ohio, occasioned by

the death of Mr. C. F. Adae.









<B>52           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Honorable John B. Stallo has been named as a suitable person

to fill the vacancy. I am personally well acquainted with Judge

Stallo. He is an able lawyer and an influential and upright citi-

zen whose reputation, experience, and capacity fit him in an

eminent degree for the position of consular representative for

any European Power desiring such representative in one of the

important cities of the United States.

  I have the honor to be,

                     Very respectfully,

                            Your obedient servant,

                 FREMONT, OHIO, May 23, Saturday, 1868.

  MY DARLING:--Came from Chicago this morning. Had a

fine time. . . .     All well here.  Young Mrs. Wade came

over with me -- vexed of course with the doings of a few Ohio

anti-Waders, but took it well. The Convention [National Re-









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          53</B>



publican] with that exception was a great success. Mrs. Lane

sends her regards. She was full of praises of you; the old Sen-

ator, ditto.             Affectionately,

                                                    R. B. H.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                  COLUMBUS, June 27, 1868.

  DEAR SMITH:--In reply to yours of yesterday: The Youngs-

town address is now half written--a dull affair, nothing fresh,

original, or even passably good in it. I rely upon a rapid, spir-

ited delivery to get it off on the audience and prefer not to let it

get into any daily. But if it must be, your wishes will be com-

plied with, but with the distinctly expressed wish that you don't

call attention to it by praise or otherwise. It will be platitu-

dinarily-tion stupid.       Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

      Chronicle Office, Cincinnati.

                                    COLUMBUS, July 2, 1868.

  MY DEAR S--:--I hope I have not got myself in a scrape

with you. I did not dream that your paper would not appear

Saturday P. M. Your letter spoke of "selling it by the time I

had comfortably concluded, etc., etc.," and so I gave it to all the

other Cincinnati papers and I now have slips this morning from

the Commercial, etc.  But how will it do to print in your last

edition Friday? There was no understanding with other papers.

Their correspondents asked for it, and they copied it. Do just

what you please with it. Mahoning is a great way off.

                            Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

       EDITOR, Chronicle.



  July 9, 1868. -- Horatio Seymour nominated because:--

  1. He was more distinctly and decidedly committed against

the Greenback theory of Mr. Pendleton and the Western De-

mocracy than any other man before that convention.









<B>54           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  2. He was by his record more completely identified with

the peace party than any man except Mr. Pendleton.

  3. He is for a reconstruction of the South which will be

agreeable to the Rebels, and opposes the reconstruction which

gives safety and power to the loyal.





                                  COLUMBUS, July 14, 1868.

  DEAR UNCLE:-- .  .  .  Joel  Bryan's  wife,  son,  and

daughter were here this morning. Had a pleasant time with

them. The son, Guy, is a fine, excellent young man of twenty-

six years--sensible, intelligent, etc.  The old friends are all

prosperous. Negro business in that county works well -- no fuss

or trouble. The young man is a Democrat and was at New

York [National Democratic Convention], but is free from bigot-

ry and nonsense; takes cheerful and sensible views of things.

  I go to Cincinnati tomorrow to stay a few days. Yes, hurrah

for Seymour and Blair! The thing is a wet blanket here to our

Democrats. The prospect has certainly improved for us.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                                   COLUMBUS, July 25, 1868.

  DEAR GENERAL: -- You make me feel "wuss and wuss" but I

can't make the trip. Her beauty and "incomparable" charms of

all sorts I am sure are of the lasting kind. I can't say as to

how she will "keep" in other respects. There is one thing (to

the shame of our society be it spoken) which makes it probable

that she will stay. She has no fortune to attract the flies.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

      Cincinnati.









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          55</B>



  Private and Confidential.

                              COLUMBUS, October 27, 1868.

  MY DEAR S--:--The  Chronicle contains an unlucky little

sentence. Of course it is not to be corrected or alluded to, but

the governor neither can nor ought "to prevent breaches of the

peace." Yet there are people who expect it, and that makes the

sentence unlucky. If there was an insurrection or mob which

the civil authorities could not control, I could call out the military

(if there was any?) but it is the business of the civil authorities

to take care of "breaches of the peace." The governor has no

civil authority. I write merely out of abundant caution.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

      Cincinnati.

                             COLUMBUS, November 3, 1868.

  DEAR UNCLE:--Platt heard my talk about the taxes for

ditches and roads on your Wood County lands with the great-

est good humor. He laughed about it; said he rather thought

the lands might about as well be given up, but would leave all

that to you and Doctor Rawson. He seemed to regard the big

figures I gave him as a good joke. There will be no trouble

or feeling with him.

  Judge Matthews staid with us during the session of the

Electoral College. His daughter Bella, the eldest and favorite,

aged seventeen, died suddenly while he was here.

  Lucy has gone down to Glendale. We got home in five hours

from Fremont by way of Monroeville and Clyde. The quickest

time I ever made. All well.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                           WASHINGTON, November 9, 1868.

  DEAR GUY:--I came here last night chiefly to attend to your

cause. The President has just given me an order for the par-

don of yourself and brothers.  I congratulate you all.









<B>56           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I concur fully with the sentiments of your letter. I hope

you will all agree to one further amendment of the Constitution,

viz., the basis of representation to be voters. This I deem very

essential.  Don't commit yourself against it until I can write

you fully.

  I return home tomorrow. All Cincinnati friends are well.

Regards to your wife.

                            As ever,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GUY M. BRYAN,

      Texas.

                             COLUMBUS, November 11, 1868.

  DEAR  UNCLE:--We are jogging along as usual--a little

more to do than heretofore. The Legislature meeting soon and

various matters overlooked claiming attention.

  I spent the election day [at Cincinnati] looking at Mr. Pro-

basco's fine pictures, statuary, library, and house. The house

is much the finest I ever was in. He has a few pictures of all

peoples -- English, German, French, Italian, Asiatic, etc. He

prefers French art to any other.

  We hope to spend Thanksgiving with you and shall do so

if not prevented by something I don't now foresee. Grant's

election was a happy thing. He seems to behave admirably.

The effect South and everywhere seems good.

                           Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                             COLUMBUS, December 19, 1868.

  DEAR UNCLE:--Got home safe this morning.            Had a good

time. The most satisfactory part of the trip was several hours'

quiet talk with General Grant. It was a most delightful talk.

After he warms up he is just about such a man as Charley Boalt

used to be--quite as cheerful, chatty, and good-natured, and so

sensible, clear-headed, and well-informed. I feel just as much at

ease with him as I do with intimate friends like Hastings or

Force--more so than with Bushnell or even Buckland! This









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          57</B>



sounds strange, but I mention it because it will give you an

idea how completely and wonderfully he remains unspoiled by

his elevation. I think I will come up soon and give you some

of his talk.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



                              COLUMBUS, January 18, 1869.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I received yours enclosing draft for $551.68.

proceeds of bond for which I am obliged.

  We are all very well. The Legislature comes together in

good feeling, and the past week has been an animated time,

meeting friends, acquaintances, and strangers.  Mr.  Emmitt

has placed two more statues in the rotunda which I suppose

are really by Mead. They are about one-third life-size and

very pretty.

  The best book of the sort I have seen is "Personal Sketches

of Grant" by Richardson, author of "Field, Dungeon, and

Escape," which you have.  I will bring it up when I come two

or three weeks hence.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.



                              COLUMBUS, January 21, 1869.

  MY DEAR GUY:--Your New Year's letter made me happy.

Time is rapidly getting our political differences out of the way.

We shall hardly be as wide apart again as we were ten years

ago. Personally, we never were divided. Hereafter I hope we

I was at Gambier Monday to see the inauguration of a new

president. The enclosed gives you a report of it. Altogether a

good time.  I spoke of you to numbers of old friends who have

friendly recollections of auld lang syne. Hurd, Buttles, Jones,

etc., always ask about you.

  Excuse this. I am writing in the office with too many inter-

and children. I hope to see you again soon.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of yours of the 13th. I

have taken some pains to keep posted on the state of things

at Washington and from different sources, as well informed,

perhaps, as anybody, I get advices which lead me to think

"pressure" a bad thing. I have so far kept away designedly,

and think it would have been better if others had done so.

If anything turns up changing the looks I'll act at once. You

evidently think as I do about it.  Grant's little speech has

different versions and the words you quote are not probably

"verbatim copy."  However, I have no misgivings.  There will

be dissatisfactions, of course, but I think nothing serious.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I received today the Globe containing the

debate on the Butler resolution of censure.<B>*</B> I have felt like

thanking you for your part in that debate ever since I read it,

and I congratulate you very heartily upon it. It is absolutely

necessary that on such occasions somebody should have the

pluck to talk truth and sense, and it is a fortunate circumstance

to have a man of position and ability to do it.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                                COLUMBUS, March 7, 1869.

  DEAR UNCLE:--We are all well.  Political talk is just now

all the talk.  Grant's inaugural strikes me  as capital.       His

Cabinet looks like a revolution, an experiment. If it succeeds,

as I hope it will, all will applaud him for his courage and wis-

dom.   Otherwise,  otherwise.    It is a Cabinet for work, for

honesty, and for economy. It contains three radicals, Wash-

burne, Creswell, and Howe; three conservative Republicans,

Cox, Stewart, and Borie. It is outside of political circles--

no man of political strength in the list, and is therefore un-

trammelled, owes nobody anything. It contains no Presidential

aspirants, and may therefore be regarded as organized for

harmony. No man being conspicuous, Grant's leadership and

rule is beyond question. It seems to mean business and not

political scheming. It is an attempt to put fitness and qualifi-

cations before what is called "claims" and "political services."

If anybody could overthrow the spoils doctrine and practice,

Grant is the man. It has been thought impossible hitherto,

but I hope with some confidence that he will win.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                               COLUMBUS, March 10, 1869.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I sent two letters to Mr. Barrett this morn-

ing, one to General Cox, and one to General Grant.

  Your letter indicates that you are in doubt of the future.

I suppose there is some reason for it, but I confess I don't

feel it. There is just now a wild hubbub at Washington and to

some extent in the country, but I think I see the main points

are all right and think that before a great while the present

doubting will disappear. "Wait for the facts."

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                               COLUMBUS, March 24, 1869.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I spent four days in Washington most

pleasantly. There is still a lack of harmony on the Tenure of

Office Law, but generally the prospect is good of a strong, suc-

cessful, and popular Administration. On all essentials, Grant is

more perfectly in accord with Republican ideas than was gen-

erally supposed was the case. The Cabinet is personally likely

to be very popular. Economy and good sense seem to be in

power.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                                  COLUMBUS, April 3, 1869.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . .  The best thing of my administra-

tion, I suspect, will be the beginning of the geological survey.

It carried very handsomely in both branches. Now comes the

important point. Who is to be chief geologist? My preposses-

sions are for Professor Newberry.      Please ask Mr. Bushnell

about it and get him to write me, showing him or telling him

what I say.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                                 COLUMBUS, April 15, 1869.

  DEAR  GENERAL:--The Fifth Virginia was commanded  by

Colonel Zigler until about 1863, then by Colonel Tomlinson

until the end of its first term of enlistment, and in 1864 re-

enlisted and became the First West Virginia Veteran Volunteers

under Colonel Wm. H. Enochs.  Its men would naturally claim

the veteran regiment to be the same as the former Fifth, as it

was principally composed of the officers and men of the Fifth,

consolidated with the Ninth however.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                                 COLUMBUS, April 19, 1869.

  MY DEAR BOY:--I am sending Uncle a box containing oats

and barley and also a small box inside of it with fossil shell-

fish, a fossil shark's tooth, and a bud, I suppose it is, of a lily

fossilized. I visited a small but valuable collection of such

things this morning. They were found near here and at Dela-

ware. At Delaware they find bones of enormous fishes of

species long since extinct. There are septaria, or large round

stones like Uncle's, formed around large fish bones--particu-

larly the bones of the head and the jaws, six and eight feet

in diameter! That story will make Uncle open his eyes. Mr.

Herzer, the German who gave me the fossils, has a micro-

scope which magnifies three hundred times. A small-sized

louse looks as big as a full grown rat, and [a] much more ter-

rible beast than a rat he is with his claws and pinching appara-

tus.

                        Affectionately,

  WEBB C. HAYES,                               R. B. HAYES.

  DEAR S--: -- Enclosed I send you a letter for Nixon to

Delano. What are your ideas on school commissioner? Cow-

dery, White, Harvey, and Henkle seem ahead. As Lincoln

would say, I have very little influence with the governor, but

would suggest names in about the above order.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

                                 COLUMBUS, April 29, 1869.

  DEAR S--:--I rather like your ticket. But Mr. Henkle is

not a candidate. No recommendations are on file for him, (a

circumstance which perhaps ought to be decisive in his favor!),

and having said I would try to give the school men their choice,

I propose to do it if they can make one.









<B>62           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  You don't say White once.        Warner is strong for him, and a

good crowd of first-class school men. I am in no hurry.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.

                                    COLUMBUS, May 1, 1869.

  DEAR S--: -- I am  obliged for your frank letter.  It comes

nearer the core of the matter than any word I have yet had.

I may not act on it, but the chances are that I shall. I have

a sort of pledge out to appoint the choice of the school men. If

they by their letters, etc., etc., do decidedly make a choice, I

shall act on it even of it takes the man you dislike. But it

looks now as if I should be left free.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.

                                    COLUMBUS,  May 6, 1869.

  DEAR S--:--The  use of the phrase, "the man you dislike,"

in my note to you, was unfortunate. I am sorry for it. No

meaning containing an imputation on your motives was in my

mind--none  whatever.         Your  letter shows  a dislike for one

of the gentlemen named, as I thought, but it did not, and does

not occur to me that therefore you opposed him. You named

another and a solid reason--a reason which deserves to be con-

sidered. The part of your letter enclosed in brackets contains

what I refer to as showing "dislike." The last sentence in your

letter of the 5th will, I trust, on reflection be reconsidered.<B>*</B>

                           Sincerely,

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.                                R. B. HAYES.



<FONT SIZE="-1">  *Mr. Smith had written: --"I am  not in the habit of letting my

  DEAR UNCLE: -- I returned from the East Tuesday night, and

found all at home as usual. My trip was in all respects very

interesting. Nothing was pleasanter than a look through the

Art Gallery, Stewart's new store, and the view from Nordhoff's

cottage on the Palisades of the Hudson. The best talks I

heard were those of Mr. Kennedy, the superintendent of the

metropolitan police, the successor of old Hayes. I was with

him the most of two days. -- All well.

                          Sincerely,

  DEAR GENERAL:--Looking over the letters opened and read

hastily on the day of the convention,<B>*</B> I find the enclosed which

is no doubt the lost letter to you.

  Your capital speech the other day, the night of the 23rd,

I have read with great satisfaction, and I hope you will make

your arrangements to speak for the committee during the can-

vass and at a long list of meetings.

  DEAR S--: -- I am sorry not to be here to meet you.

  I think of nothing in particular to say. There is a whispering

which leads me to suspect that they [the Democratic leaders]

are hoping, and perhaps trying, to get Rosecrans to decline.  If

he declines it will change the programme essentially. Until

that matter is decided I suspect we had better show up their

talk about him, and his talk about them as our principal topic,

so far as merely personal issues go.

  I am ready to begin [the canvass] whenever it is deemed

best, and would advise going first and chiefly into doubtful or

Union counties.

                          Sincerely,

Rosecrans' declination does not affect it much. He would have

been beaten. So I think will whoever they run.

  DEAR UNCLE: -- The business of the office and the canvass

Pendleton's nomination makes the race more interesting and

more doubtful. But I guess it will be all right.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I wrote the enclosed [following] letter to the

editor of the Democrat, but noticing that he refers to you, it

seems more proper to write you on the subject, and as I am

pressed for time I send you the letter to show you that I take

it all in good part.

  I add two things: First, I regret you did not write me after

the state convention your views; and, secondly, I did tell all

our Republican friends who conversed with me on such topics

to oppose debts except in the extremest cases.

  I hope it will do us no injury, and trust you will agree with

me that the long sessions and excessive legislation of the last

Legislature ought to be avoided.

                          Sincerely,

  MY DEAR SIR:--I have read the article you send me. The

spirit of it is so just and fair that I cannot complain of it. At

the same time I must think as to the Commisisoners' Bill that

it violates the spirit of the constitution in not placing limits

or conditions upon the power of the board.  You do not allude

to the most objectionable bill--the Road Bill.

  But I write merely to say that I think we can't differ on my

main objection, viz., the long sessions--the overlegislation.

To that I did object in my inaugural message and this is what

led to the greatest abuses. I shall listen to all such friendly

suggestions as yours, and so far as I can do it, without for-

saking principle, will accommodate my discussions to the views

of the friends. It is perhaps a hobby with me, but I do hate

debt, and I am opposed to authorizing it except as a dernier

ressort.

  DEAR UNCLE:--. . .  I am over my hardest week's work

and find myself still in good condition in all respects. I shall

drift up into your vicinity next week. I can form no very

definite notion as to prospects. There are some clouds at Cin-

cinnati and Cleveland growing out of local troubles, but with

these exceptions the coast is clear and appearances encouraging.

  Honorable Richard M. Corwine, of Cincinnati, Ohio, is a

lawyer of large experience, whose practice in the higher courts

of the State and of the United States for many years has given

him wide reputation. He has devoted himself to his profes-

sion almost without interruption more than twenty-five years.

Whatever qualifications for the discharge of important judicial

duties can be acquired by a gentleman of intellect, of excellent

temper and manners, and of great industry, may be justly

claimed for Mr. Corwine.

  DEAR CORWINE:--You have  the joke on me if I have not

on you. The word to my eye is plainly judicial not political.

Either my writing or your reading is greatly at fault.

  I can say nothing further as yet. Indeed, I feel some em-

barrassment may arise in doing so much as I have. I trust my

letter will not be used or mentioned, if it does not seem neces-

  DEAR GENERAL:--My wife and I both wish to say thank

you for the beautiful pictures [reproductions of paintings in

European galleries]. They are so fine that I want to be able

to talk about them--how  they  are  done;  where  are the

originals; whose? etc., etc. I am told that a negative is ob-

tained from the painting by the ordinary process, that the

negative is retouched, and these pictures printed from the im-

proved negative.

  The next time I meet you I propose to hear you on your

trip. So try not [to] forget it altogether.

                          Sincerely,

  MY DEAR WEBB:--. . .  Yesterday one of the teachers

in the public schools tried an interesting experiment in the

rotunda of the State House. He suspended an iron ball weigh-

ing twenty pounds by a fine wire from the top of the dome and

by letting it swing as a pendulum demonstrated very satisfac-

torily that the earth moves from the west to the east. The wire

had to be one hundred and twenty feet long to reach from the

dome to the floor. A line was drawn on the floor due north

and south and the ball set to swinging directly over the line.

In an hour the line of the ball's motion was nine degrees variant

from the north and south line, showing that in forty hours the

variation would go clear around the circle.  It was a curious

demonstration, but while everybody saw the result, only a few

seemed to fully comprehend it.

           I have a large number of the coats of arms of the

States cut from the letters I get.  If you want them I'll send









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          69</B>



them to you. . . . You must always write with ink.  You

forgot to give the year in dating your last letter.  Your letter

as a whole was very well written.--Ruddy and your mother

send love to you and Birch.

                 Affectionately, your father,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

      Fremont.

                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 7, 1869.

  DEAR COLONEL:--Thanks for your call and pencil note at

Cincinnati. I was sorry not to see you. I wanted to hear your

talk --not more than I always do, -- and as I am not likely to

meet you often, I now want to know where you are to settle, if

you do settle, that I can have the next best thing to your talk --

your writings.

  Judging by our last conversation, for pecuniary and other

reasons you prefer a position to being merely a disturbing ele-

ment; but as I see it, the latter is your vocation -- a vocation in

which you can do great things in the present political, religious,

social, etc., etc.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  COLONEL DONN PIATT.

                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 8, 1869.

  DEAR GENERAL:--I congratulate you back again [--on your

election to the state Senate].  Some enemy of yours reported

that you would be badly beaten in any event. But I didn't believe

it. I agree with you. Our lines didn't fall in the right years.

The "off years," as Greeley calls them, are bad years to run for

office.

  The missionary story is out of whole cloth.  I went to church

like a good Christian on the Sunday I was reported to be

ploughing with the Hamilton County Reform  Members  and

didn't see one of them. Bishop Thompson preached a capital

discourse on the text, "Be ye faithful to the end and I will

give you a crown of life," or words to that effect. If you had









<B>70           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



heard it you wouldn't have thought of that infamous suspicion

that I was imitating Sam Cary because I quoted scripture in

my Thanksgiving proclamation. Hassaurek says the Reformers

will be with us on the Fifteenth Amendment. I think so too.

Lew Campbell, it is said, boasts that he will prevent the ratifi-

cation in the Senate, but as both of the Reformers are perfectly

sound I suppose it is safe. . . .

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  Kind regards to Mrs. Potts.

  GENERAL B. F. POTTS,

      Carrollton, Ohio.

                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 9, 1869.

  DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your favor of the 6th inst.

in relation to the appointment of State Librarian, and in reply

I must frankly say that, as at present advised, the incumbent

will at the end of his term be reappointed. If I had an oppor-

tunity to talk with you face to face I would go into the reasons

for this course. I recognize the validity of your claims and

under other circumstances would be glad to give them a favor-

able hearing.

  Supposing your letters may be of value to you, I respectfully

return them.

                          Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

      Yellow Springs, Ohio.



                     COLUMBUS, OHIO, November  10, 1869.

  DEAR NORDHOFF:--You are not the only "wretch" (I have

adopted that good word from you) who harrows up the feelings

of my wife by sending the Harper's picture of me. It has

driven me into the photograph business and I am now jawing

back in this way.

  I want to send Walter "The President's Words"--the book

of Lincoln's wisdom, I named to you.  How--by express or

mail, and direction?









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          71</B>



  I have not seen Aunty Davis since your article on the Bible

question. I fear she will think you have gone back on her

hopes of you. I take the Bible side, largely because this war

on the Good Book is in disguise a war on all free schools.

                          Sincerely,          R. B. HAYES.

  CHARLES NORDHOFF.



                     COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 10, 1869.

  DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your note of the 8th.  I agree

with you as to the importance of securing a fire-proof building

for the library. It seems to me so important that I would not

wait until the society can build or purchase such rooms. Can't

a room that would answer the purpose be rented? I, however,

ought not to make suggestions. My income does not permit

me to do more than pay the ten dollars assessment in aid of

the society's object. I would be glad to do more if I could.

                          Sincerely,          R. B. HAYES.

  JULIUS DEXTER,

      RECORDING SECRETARY, HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL

        SOCIETY.

                     COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 11, 1869.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your favor of the 9th

in relation to the claims of Mr. Forster and Dr. Morton. I

had some knowledge of the merits of Mr. Forster's applica-

tion and have written two letters in his behalf. In reply to

one I was told that consulates are all gobbled up long ago--

that his only chance is the resignation or death of the present

incumbents; and you know "few die and none resign."

  As to Dr. Morton, I know him well, but I suppose Mr. Har-

bough, who is a faithful good officer, ought not to be turned out.

  If more letters or good words in behalf of Mr. Forster are

wanted, I am ready to furnish them. But as Mr. Lincoln said

when he was President: "I have very little influence with this

Administration."

                          Sincerely,          R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE O. FOLLETT,

<B>72           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                     COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 13, 1869.

  DEAR SAGE:--I am in receipt of yours of yesterday. I will

send you reports of [the] Ohio Penitentiary and Reform Farm.

No  report of Girls' Reformatory yet made.  But the rules

adopted may answer your purpose and I will try to get them

for you.  They were approved by me as the law required and

were in the handwriting of Judge M-- [Matthews (?)].

  I have the Thanksgiving  proclamations  of  twenty-seven

States--all recognizing religion, nearly all the religion of the

Bible, and several the Divinity of Christ.  More are coming,

doubtless.  Our Legislature for many years has passed a joint

resolution annually authorizing a thanksgiving and frequently

in terms which recognized the religion of the Bible.  The last

Legislature omitted to do so by a mere accident this year, but in

[the] Sixty-fifth volume Ohio Laws, page 306, passed one last

year.  If you wish to borrow my bundle  of Thanksgiving

proclamations I will send them to you.  All state institutions

have religious exercises, some of them  chaplains paid under

state laws.  The meetings of the two houses of the General As-

sembly are always opened with prayer in accordance,  some-

times,  with  resolutions  (passed  unanimously  usually), and

sometimes by common consent.  The inaugurations of governors

are prefaced by religious exercises.

  The general proposition on which you stand is undoubtedly

sound.  Whether your particular relief can be granted by a

court is perhaps doubtful; and if you are beaten I am not sure

but the question will go before the committee in a better form

for a final and  correct decision by the people without the

intervention of the courts in opposition to the late action of

the School Board than it will with such intervention.  But if

I can aid you, call on me.

                          Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your favor of the 20th

as to a recommendation for an office in the revenue service.  I









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          73</B>



am  called upon to sign so many  recommendations that I have

acted upon a rule which practically destroys in a great measure

the value of the testimonials I give, viz., to give only general

recommendations, and to give those to all who desire it with this

qualification, that I state what I know or believe to be true in

each case. In this matter I have already given a general testi-

monial to a gentleman who applied to me before your letter

came to hand. If a general letter of the sort indicated will be

of service to you I will be glad to furnish it. Should you wish

a letter, please send me a specimen of the testimonials you are

furnished with.

  My kind regards to Mrs. Pittenger.

  DEAR H--:--I have been absent or busy moving these last

days or I would have said a word in reply to yours of the 10th.

I published the article<B>*</B> in the Journal.  No reflection was of

course intended on you in particular.  The general practice you

evidently regard just as I do, and I am  sure there is no mis-

understanding on your part of my motives.  I regard you as a

man whose soundness of judgment and integrity  of purpose in



<FONT SIZE="-1">  *The article read:--"An illustration of the thoughtlessness with which

good men sign important petitions occurred at the governor's office a few

days ago. A petition for the pardon of a convict numerously signed was

presented to Governor Hayes.      Among  the signers was a gentleman

known to the governor to be a man of integrity and good sense.  The

gentleman was written to and asked what he knew or could learn as to

the merits of the case.  A  few days afterwards the governor received a

reply, marked 'private', in which the writer said:  'I signed the petition

for his pardon presented to me by his wife.  My tenderness of heart in

the case overcame my judgment.      As no good would be accomplished

by his pardon, I fully investigated the case.  I could obtain no redeeming

quality in the convict from those familiar with him.   He is represented

by all as a very dangerous person to run at large, and from reports he is

a natural thief and would, no doubt, continue his former career if par-

doned.'"</FONT>

such a case may be implicitly relied on; and the point was made

clearer to my mind than it can be to the public.

  DEAR GOVERNOR:--I thank you for your efforts in the Le-

roy matter.  I have no doubt he is deliberately trying to levy

blackmail on me. The pretext is a deposit claimed to have

been made by his son when a soldier in my command. I find

abundant evidence that the claim is a fabrication of Leroy.

At first I did not know but he was acting in good faith, and

that the fraud was in the informants.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL LUCIUS FAIRCHILD,

      Governor of Wisconsin.



  Columbus, Ohio, November 28, 1869.--On the 17th we be-

gan to move from our late residence, 51 East State Street, to

Judge Swayne's residence on Seventh Street, facing west and

opposite the centre of East State Street. We are to pay eight

hundred dollars per year and to have the use of some articles of

furniture. It is a fine, large house with ample grounds. The

rent is cheap.

  I was re-elected by 7501 majority over Mr. Pendleton, and

shall remain in office two years from next January, if nothing

occurs to prevent.

  December 2, 1869.--I now begin to collect materials and set

down a few items for my annual message:--

  1.  Fifteenth Amendment--a few words of emphatic recom-

mendation and approval. 2. Soldiers' Orphans' Homes. 3.

Reform, improvement, or progress in prison discipline. 4. The

Reappraisement.    5.  The  Geological  Survey.  6.  Inebriate

Asylum. 7. Incurable Insane. 8. Agricultural fund; college

to be located, (See 1859, p. 51). --(Mem.:--In my brief in-

augural why not suggest topics, improvements, or amendments

of the Constitution?)

  Take up the benevolent and reformatory institutions; give

their condition, number of inmates, cost, etc., etc. (See Gov-

ernor Chase's message 1860.)

  To recommend clearly and briefly the things deemed best

without argument or illustration.





                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 2, 1869.

  DEAR HASTINGS:--I am in receipt of your note of the 30th

ult. It is of course flattering and pleasant to be thought of in

that connection, and I appreciate the value of the support sug-

gested, but I do not feel like scheming to that end. Perhaps

I may be ready sometime to do what is commonly done, but so

long in advance, I am indisposed to make figures, or even to

decide the question of giving my own consent to a continuance

in public life. I feel now like quitting. I hope for your pocket's

sake that the business will be in your hands.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL RUSSELL HASTINGS.



                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 4, 1869.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Yours of yesterday received.  I think there

will be small opposition in the committee to keeping the Lincoln

out of sight until the inauguration of the complete work. But

we do insist upon getting it here away from your tinder-box.

I expect to hear you have been burnt out by next mail, and shall

continue in that agreeable state of mind until relieved by the

happening of that event! It is only the special providence which

watches over you and the sparrows which has saved you so

long!

                          Sincerely,

                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 6, 1869.

  DEAR GENERAL:--I am just in receipt of your note of the

third with an article from the Statesman  annexed.  The article

had not attracted my attention, but of course I should not have

publicly noticed it.  There is not a word of truth in it so far

as I am concerned. I have spent but two days in Washington

since Grant's inauguration--yes, it was  four or five days-

and took no part against you then or at any time. No assur-

ance was needed that neither you nor your friends are respon-

sible for this sort of insinuation; but I am glad to feel safe that

such things can't sow tares between us.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

Private.

                             COLUMBUS, December 7, 1869.

  DEAR SIR:--I concur with your views of prison discipline

so far as I know them.  In my next message I wish to say a

few words recommending the creation of a prison for young

offenders to be conducted on the principles of your report of

December, 1868, (Twenty-fourth Annual Report), and to call

attention in a general way to the Irish convict system.  The

present Board of Directors and the Warden of the Ohio Peni-

tentiary are prepared to take enlightened and humane action.

But I do not anticipate the immediate adoption of your theory.

My desire is to say enough to open the subject to the considera-

tion of the people of the State.  If you have issued, or can refer

me to any new publications on the subject, I will be glad to send

you their cost.

                         Sincerely,

                             COLUMBUS, December 11, 1869.

  DEAR SIR:--I am today in receipt of your letter of the 8th

inst., expressing the opinion that Mr. James Leroy is honest

in making a claim against me for money left with me by his

son.  There is no foundation for the claims and to enable me

to discover who is the guilty party in getting up the claim, I

will be obliged to you if you will give me the names and address

of the parties whose statements you refer to, "oral and written,"

which you have heard and seen.

                        Respectfully,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

      Sparta, Wisconsin.

                             COLUMBUS, December 11, 1869.

  DEAR SIR:--I am today in receipt of your letter of the 8th

inst., inclosing letters from gentlemen of your acquaintance,

showing their opinion that you are acting in good faith in mak-

ing a claim on me for money deposited with me by your son.

Assuming that they are innocent, somebody is guilty of an at-

tempt to impose on you. There is no truth whatever in the

story about Leroy leaving money with me. Your friends can

have no objection to giving me the names in full and post-

office addresses of your informants that I may investigate the

whole matter.

                         Yours, etc.,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

      Sparta, Wisconsin.

                             COLUMBUS, December 19, 1869.

  DEAR SIR: -- I am exceedingly obliged by your prompt reply

to my letter as to prison reform and for the volumes of valuable

documents on the subject which you forwarded. No sudden or

sweeping reform will be attempted here. But we desire to en-

courage the formation of correct opinions and hope that a

gradual but steady advance may be made towards a reformatory

system. The principles of the Irish system can I believe be

introduced in practice without undertaking to copy in detail

a scheme which may in some of its features be unsuited to our

conditions.

                          Sincerely,

                             COLUMBUS, December 20, 1869.

  DEAR GENERAL:--A  scoundrel in Wisconsin is trying to

blackmail me. He claims that on the morning of Sheridan's

victory of Winchester, October 19, 1864, his son deposited with

me from eight hundred to one thousand dollars, money lately

 received for pay and veteran bounty. The boy was killed in the

battle. It is all false, and I now desire to get the amounts paid to

the boy between January I, 1864, and October 19, 1864. I will

pay any clerk you may set at the job of digging it up for his

trouble and be greatly obliged for a statement or certificate that I

can show if necessary.  The boy's name was Nelson J. Leroy,

private Company I, Twenty-third Regiment 0. V. I.

                          Sincerely,

       Washington, D. C.

                             COLUMBUS, December 21, 1869.

  DEAR GENERAL:--I have your letter of the 20th and am

glad to know, what I believed before, that you would stand by

the flag notwithstanding the attractions of Montana until the

crisis of organization and the Fifteenth Amendment is passed.

I am advised, I think authentically, that the Hamilton members

have settled to give the pro tempore Speaker of the Senate

to the Democrats, Clerk to the Republicans, and so alternate

through the offices and committees.  In the House, Speaker,

Republican, Clerk, Democrat, etc., on down.      [The prospect

for the ratification of the] Fifteenth Amendment [is] hopeful.

Russell's vacancy will be filled in time.  There may be an effort

to claim that no vacancy existed authorizing a special election,









             <B>GOVERNOR OF OHIO--1868-1869          79</B>



Russell not being a Senator until admitted and sworn. But

West says it is all bosh. There was a vacancy, etc., etc.

   Congratulations and regards to Mrs. Governor Potts.

                          Sincerely,

                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 23, 1869.

   MY DEAR SIR:--I received your dispatch about the Chase

portrait. I think it altogether probable that Mr. Cook would

like to do the graceful thing in that behalf. But the main ques-

tion which I now put is, who shall bell the cat? Who shall

name the matter to Mr. Cook? In scriptural phrase may I

not say: "Thou art the man"?

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

       Cincinnati, Ohio.

                             COLUMBUS, December 29, 1869.

  DEAR SIR:--I am asked to write you in behalf of young

Hosea, now in the State Prison of your State. I have no

knowledge of him or of his crime.  There is no doubt that his

widowed mother is a most estimable woman,  and that the

gentlemen who take an interest in the case are worthy in all

respects. Dr. Wadsworth, who will visit you, is, I know, an

upright, conscientious, and truthful gentleman.  I bespeak for

him and his statements the utmost confidence and consideration.

                          Sincerely,

  DEAR SIR:--I thank you for your kind favor of the 17th

inst. I will now give you a few of the facts which I have ascer-

tained bearing upon the merits of Leroy's claim.









<B>80           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  1. N. J. Leroy re-enlisted as a veteran January 1, 1864, and

was at Cleveland and at home on a veteran furlough in Feb-

uary, 1864, and at the end of his furlough borrowed money of

a comrade to enable him to return to his regiment.

  2.  After his return to his regiment he was paid only once

prior to his death, and the amount paid was $169.75.

  3. The rest of his pay and bounty due from the Govern-

ment was paid to his "legal representatives" after his death,

amounting to $365.

  4. His local bounty due from the town of Youngstown was

paid after his death to his mother, amounting to

  These facts I have from three sources, viz., the first from his

comrades in Cleveland; the second, third, and fourth from cer-

tificates of the proper officers of which I enclose you copies.

  I think you will now agree with me that the only remaining

question in this matter is, whether your townsman, James Leroy,

has been himself deceived, or whether he is guilty of an attempt

to defraud?

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE D. W. C. WILSON,

      Sparta, Wisconsin.

                             COLUMBUS, December 31, 1869.

  DEAR  LAWRENCE:--You are perfectly right in your view.

We must have a genuine retrenchment and economy. The

monthly reduction of the debt is of far more consequence than

the reduction of taxation in any form.  I hope too you will

abolish the franking privilege, and adopt the general principles

of Trumbull's bill and Jenckes' bill. It would please the people,

and [is] right and wise. I will act on your suggestions.

Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

   HONORABLE WILLIAM LAWRENCE,

       Washington.



   January 2, 1870. -- We have enjoyed the holidays better than

 ever before. All the boys at home, happy, well-behaved, and

promising; litle Fan a sunbeam; Lucy improved and appreciated.

Our large, fine house, belonging to Judge Swayne, our re-elec-

tion, and many circumstances combine to make this a time of

great satisfaction and enjoyment. My inaugural, I thought of

at church. To be very short; a sentence or two of acknowledg-

ment and then, as the Constitution is to [be] amendable in my

time -- in my new term -- suggest for consideration changes as

to subscription to railroads, as to temperance, as to courts, as to

suffrage, as to minority representation, as to local debts -- all

debts.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 5, 1870.

  DEAR SIR: -- My attention has been called to the claim of the

State of Ohio against the United States for two per cent of

the net proceeds arising from the sales of public lands within

the State to be expended by Congress in constructing roads. It

is believed that the State has a valid claim and Mr. William A.

Adams visits Washington to investigate the facts. I trust you

will afford him such facilities and assistance for his work as

you may deem proper.

                         Respectfully,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JACOB D. COX,

      Washington, D. C.

                                COLUMBUS, January 6, 1870.

  MY  DEAR SIR: --  In reply to your favor of the 4th:         I do

not regard the organization of the [Ohio] House as an indica-

tion of any new difficulty.  The  House contains one hundred

and twelve members as at present organized. One Republican

member represents a county which Democrats claim is not en-

titled to representation.   Mr. Blakeslee, of Williams County,

feels confident that he can't be ousted. One Republican seat

is contested, viz., Mr. Glover, of Scioto. I am confident he is

also safe. The House therefore stands, and I think will stand

to the end, Republicans, straight, 53; Democrats, straight, 49;

Republican Reformers 5; Democratic Reformers 5. The Demo-

   6

cratic Reformers will probably all vote against the Fifteenth

Amendment making 54 negative votes.

  We regard it as certain beyond contingency that three Re-

publican Reformers will vote for the Amendment making 56

affirmative votes, or exactly one-half of the House. The other

two Republican Reformers we think will vote for the Amend-

ment, or at the worst will refuse to vote either way. In either

event the Amendment is ratified. I say probably the Democratic

Reformers will vote no. Many of our friends are confident

that two of them will either vote aye or refuse to vote.  They

and others in the Democratic party want the Amendment rati-

fied. But I do not reckon on their help.

  In short, I regard the chances as good. If you can help us

in any way, do not fail to do it. The Amendment will probably

not be ratified in the Senate until a week from today, January

13. It then goes to the House, and the final struggle is there.

I am quite confident of success.

                          Sincerely,

  HONORABLE O. P. MORTON,                        R. B. HAYES.

      Washington, D. C.



                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 12, 1870.

  DEAR AUNTY DAVIS:--It pleased me to know that you ap-

proved of the message. It is a matter of no consequence who

wrote it. The rule as to public documents is that the signature

determines the authorship. I will send you the inaugural also.

  You will like the enclosed slips written by Nordhoff and which

he desired me to send to you.  I would like to keep them and

will thank you to return them. The ground is the true one.  We

must not let them push religion out of the schools, but we must

avoid forcing it on anybody.  You may ask, How are the two

things to be accomplished?  Well, it is easier to do the thing

than to tell how to do it.

  Regards to Dr. Davis and the young people.

                          Sincerely,

  MRS. DR. JOHN DAVIS,                          R. B. HAYES.

      Cincinnati, Ohio.

Confidential.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 13, 1870.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I think we can now give the result of the

struggle on the Fifteenth Amendment. The subject is under

debate in the Senate and ratification will carry when the vote

is reached--probably tomorrow. In the House of one hun-

dred and twelve members we reckon certain fifty-seven votes,

fifty-three straight Republicans and the Speaker (Mr. Cunning-

ham), Mr. Bates, Mr. Hill, and Mr. Kleinschmidt, Republican

Reformers. These are all openly and decidedly now with us on

the main question, and on all questions likely to affect our strength

on the main question. Besides, we have the best chance for the

vote of Mr. Hambleton, Republican Reformer, and some chance

of getting two or three Democrats to dodge the vote.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE O. P. MORTON,

      Washington, D. C.

                              COLUMBUS, January 15, 1870.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I congratulate you very heartily on the re-

sult of the election in your State. Having some knowledge by

reputation and otherwise of General Hamilton, Governor Pease,

and Judge Bell, I felt some doubt when I last saw you as to the

true condition of affairs in Texas. I was unwilling to think

that those gentlemen intended to abandon the Republican Party.

I regret their course. Your opinions and conduct have been

fully vindicated by the issue, and I trust your services will

secure you the honorable recognition which I am told your

friends propose to give you.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MR. JOHN W. GLENN,

      Washington, D. C.
