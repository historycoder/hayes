   OCTOBER 13, 1890.--Rutherford  and  I  reached  In-

dianapolis about 10:30 this morning. Met General Lew

Wallace at station;--drove  with him to the Denison House.

Soon met our friend Judge Martindale and his interesting

family.

  Our Philadelphia friends, Governor Beaver, Colonel Nichol-

son, General Brown, Major Lambert, General Merrill, and other

Companions met us later. In the evening at the Grand Hotel,

with Peck, recorder, on the invitation of General Wallace, I

acted as commander. Installed eight or ten new Companions.

Then an agreeable banquet. Made an offhand speech; very well

received. Before dark visited the Columbia Club and met a

goodly number of friendly people. A small talk there.

  October 14. Tuesday. -- Breakfast with the Martindales. In

the afternoon to St. Louis which we reached, passing over the

great bridge about 7:30 P. M., and at the Lindel soon after.

Visited the headquarters of the St. Louis Companions; also the

rooms for receiving. Here often during the stay. Liquor and

refreshments, but very little intemperance.

  October 15.  Wednesday. -- Commandery-in-Chief in one of

the hotel parlors. Washington State Commandery authorized

and other routine business. Drove to the park out Washington

Street. Walked to the bridge and took cars over to East St.

Louis. Reception for us by Companion Kearnes in the evening.

Very fine in all respects. These people are more hearty and

jovial than those of the Northern cities.

<B>606          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



   October 16.  Thursday.--Visited Merchants' Exchange.  A

short speech. The exposition; a few words in the great music

hall to a big crowd. Again in the directors' room in reply to

Governor Stannard. The grand banquet in the evening very

successful. My speech satisfactory; many congratulations. One

said: "I liked your remarks."

  October 17. Friday.--With Miss Virginia and Miss Almy

Breckinridge to Shaw's Garden and Park and a beautiful lunch

at their home.

  P. M. Late at the reception room. Good-bye to Pearce, Cor-

bin, Powell, Devol, Merrill, and all the rest. One of the most

gratifying visits and affairs I ever enjoyed. A fine city, great

future.

  Visited Professor Woodward and the Manual Training

School. All good.

  Otocber 18. Saturday.--Reached Toledo about 8 A. M.

At breakfast on the train met Colonel Hay. A long and most

agreeable talk.  Hay and Nicolay will issue their Lincoln in ten

volumes soon; then a full edition of the writings of Lincoln.

  Went to Birchard's. . . . A fine visit of several hours.

  October 19.  Sunday.--Leaves have fallen a good deal since

we left, but the grove is still beautiful.

  Ashley, a good-natured, "whole-souled," unscrupulous dema-

gogue, is nominated for Congress by the Republicans. He be-

gins with an attempt [at] a rush.

  During my absence many agreeable things said to me about

my  Administration.    The tide grows more  favorable and is

really strong my way.

  Mr. Albritton preached a noble sermon today. It stirred both

intellect [and] heart. While he was speaking, I thought of this

as my speech at soldiers' meeting: --

  We gained all we fought for by our victory, viz., 1.  Union,

2. Liberty, 3. Stable popular government.

  Next, we gained immeasurably more than we then thought

of, viz., 1. General education, 2. Peace, 3. Equality of right,

condition, and hope.









             <B>LOYAL LEGION ACTIVITY          607</B>



  So far as laws and institutions avail, men should have equality

of opportunity for happiness; that is, of education, wealth,

power.  These make happiness secure.  An equal diffusion of

happiness so far as laws and institutions avail.

  Paralysis! Did I feel or only imagine a numbness of head,

of the right leg, and a difficulty in controlling the tongue? This,

after the close of the sermon. In any event, I am content. I

have had my share of the good of this world and can now

follow my darling Lucy! Probably this is too serious; only an

unusually bad cold.

  October 20. Monday. -- No severe frost yet.  Many trees are

green. The large-leaved plants are untouched. The Japanese

ivy for the most part is still green. On the west part of my bay

it is bronzed beautifully; on the east part still green. The Vir-

ginia creeper has lost all of its leaves.

  October 21. Tuesday.--Miss Avery came from Cleveland

last evening. Reading and writing letters. I call this week my

vacation. I have no preparation to make for any speech or

meeting this year. Nothing until after New Year's day 1890

[1891]. I may make two speeches in Chicago in November at

the Ohio Club and at the Congregational Club--the first on

Ohio people and the other on the prison question.

  Evening read the last chapter of the capital autobiography of

Joseph Jefferson.

  October 22.  Wednesday. -- I could not help thinking yester-

day of the fatal stroke sixteen months ago! The darling!

  Correspondence. Frances writes pleasantly from the woman's

prison at Sherborn where she is visiting Mrs. Johnson. Very

glad to have my darling daughter interested in the fallen and

unfortunate. She finds a more earnest and deeper character in

the friends of humanity than she supposed existed anywhere

until she made the acquaintance of the men and women of the

Prison Association.

  Gathered in the scraps of the Warren and Parkersburg meet-

ings, of the Cincinnati Prison Congress, [and of] the Indianapolis

and the St. Louis Loyal Legion reunions. My scrap-books are

to contain my autobiography. They will show my doings.









<B>608          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  October 23. Thursday. -- Attended a full prayer-meeting and

then an official board meeting. The board meeting was to re-

ceive reports from the convassers for subscriptions for the com-

ing year. A pretty industrious canvass was made. The results

are rather slender.

  The Golden Rule furnishes the true solution of many difficult

problems in government and society. Bishop Haygood, an ex-

slaveholder and an ex-confederate soldier, has given us the best

book on the negro question. The title of his work, a phrase

of three or four words, tells the whole story: "Our Brother in

Black." When reformers, religious teachers, and statesmen, and

the general public lift themselves up to the height of the argu-

ment contained in that pithy title, there will no longer be a

negro problem, nor a problem of capital and labor, nor any

question as to the treatment of the criminal. The words of the

quotation are familiar; the idea is not clearly and hospitably

received.  The author of "Pilgrim's Progress," seeing a con-

vict carried to his punishment, said: "There goes John Bunyan,

but for the grace of God." I have often quoted, and shall con-

tinue to quote as long as I speak on prison reform, the significant

words of Governor Horatio Seymour in his inaugural address

as president of the National Prison Association: "I never yet

found a man so untamable that there was not something of good

on which to build a hope. I never yet found a man so good that

he need not fear a fall."

  How will that do for an opening in Chicago?





                SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, October 24, 1890.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Your visit was greatly enjoyed by us

all. We hope it will be often repeated. Do not postpone; do

not wait for a special invitation. Your words about Lucy touch

me. They are very kind--very pleasant to hear.

  Do not allow them to worry you out of your place. It is only

a year until, in all probability, your friends will again come into

power. A year is nothing. For your own sake, for the men's

sake, for all of us, hold on. The tide will surely turn.









             <B>GERMAN ELEMENT IN AMERICA          609</B>



  I had a delightful time at Indianapolis and at St. Louis. I

send you a paper showing Indianapolis.

  Kind regards to Mrs. Force and Horton.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

    Soldiers' Home, Sandusky.





  October 26. Sunday.--A warm, moving, eloquent sermon on

the [text]: "Nevertheless Thy will not mine be done." --Luke.

The efficacy of sincere prayer is this: It does not always pro-

cure the thing prayed for, but it does better--it brings what is

best for you. Eloquence is earnestness, enthusiasm, warmth,

honesty.



                                FREMONT, October --, 1890.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of your valued favor of the

20th instant in behalf of the Executive Committee of the Ger-

man Citizens of Kentucky and Southern Indiana who celebrated,

October 5, 1890, the two hundredth anniversary of the arrival

of the first German immigrants who settled in the United States.

Your request that I should give you "an estimate of the German

element in the United States" finds me altogether unprepared

justly and adequately to respond to your wishes. Circumstances

permit me to write only a few unconsidered sentences.

  All the world thoroughly understands the transcendent merit

of German scholars, philosophers, statesmen, soldiers, poets, and

musicians. All the higher walks of life are filled with Germans

of world-wide fame. But "the plain people," as Mr. Lincoln

called his countrymen, who have adopted America as their

home--what shall be said of them? On several vital points

they afford a valuable and much needed example to our Amer-

ican society of British origin. They are, as a general statement,

models of thrift, industry, economy, and contentment. They

know and illustrate in their lives the worth of social and family

intercourse and happiness.

   39









<B>610          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



   During the larger part of my life I have lived where the Ger-

man element was large, and in the town and county of my home,

German names and homes are to be seen in every direction.

Would that all my countrymen could possess and enjoy their

well known and sterling virtues!

  You allude with favorable comment to my appointment of

Carl Schurz as Secretary of the Interior. Too independent of

party for present popularity, those who know him well will al-

ways think of him as a gentleman of the purest character, and

as an able, patriotic, and scholarly statesman.

                          Sincerely,

    [Unaddressed.]                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.



          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, October 27, 1890.

  MY DEAR AUNTIE DAVIS: -- In the hurry of leaving home for

New York this afternoon I have just received your "In

Memoriam." I have hastily run my eyes over it. You have done

it so well. Most heartily I thank you for it. With swimming

eyes I read it--and look and look at the portraits!  I shall want

many copies.

  Good-bye. All thanks -- all good wishes to you and the

doctor.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. ELIZA G. DAVIS,

    Cincinnati.



  October 27. Monday. -- In the evening, about 7 P. M., on the

Lake Shore Railroad for New York to attend the meeting of the

trustees of the Slater Educational Fund to elect a successor to

our excellent general agent, Dr. Haygood, now a bishop of the

Methodist Episcopal Church, South.

  [New York], October 29.  Wednesday.--Met Mr. Gilman

and Governor Colquitt; soon after all the other members except

Chief Justice Fuller. Made a careful and prudent speech in

favor of Mr. [J. L. M.] Curry for executive officer of the Slater

Board. Successful.









             <B>MRS. DAVIS'S "IN MEMORIAM"          611</B>



  October 30.  Thursday.--On the Congressional Limited to

Baltimore.   [By]  8:30 at the Rennert Hotel.  Called on by

Senator H. S. Davis, of West Virginia.  A cheerful and inter-

esting talk. He is for a railroad to South America!

  October 31.  Friday.--With [President] Gilman visited the

Johns Hopkins University. Spoke to the historical class under

Herbert Adams. The negro condition in the Virginia Military

Land District of Ohio. Then with Mr. Enoch Pratt visit the

Pratt Library, a branch of it also, and the Johns Hopkins Hos-

pital.

  Met Dr. Curry and arranged to have him take Bishop Hay-

good's duties.

  [Spiegel Grove], November 2. Sunday.-- . . .  Ruther-

ford read in the last Century a good talk by John Hay on Lin-

coln. Read also in John Fiske's book on "Civil Government in

the United States." Massachusetts with her town system and

public schools bred an intelligent and wise people. Virginia with

her county system and large plantations bred leaders.

  November 3. Monday. -- The evening mail brought sad news.

[Cousin] Russell Bigelow, in the asylum [recently attacked with

acute mania], died from exhaustion and lack of sleep Sunday

about noon. A noble boy, pure, ambitious, scholarly, and of

muscular frame, with a long life before him apparently, gone!

His afflicted mother! I wrote to her, but what can be said?

  [This] evening learned [too] that Mrs. W. P. Howland, of

Jefferson, a lady I knew well and with whom I staid, a delegate

last week here to [the meeting of the] Women's Christian Tem-

perance Union, was killed instantly on her arrival home after

she got off the train, by a freight train coming unexpectedly.

Mr. Howland a leading lawyer of Ashtabula County, a senator

in the Legislature when I was at Columbus, and a stanch friend

of mine.

  Alas! how near we are to the line that divides us from the

deepest sorrows, the saddest of calamities!

  November 4. Tuesday. -- This is the day of the general elec-

tion. I anticipate Democratic gains--a Democratic Congress.









<B>612          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



The first election of importance after a new President is affected

by the disappointments of office-seekers, and the other failures

to meet extravagant hopes. In this case also the new tariff

law--the McKinley bill--is easily misrepresented as increas-

ing the cost of all goods. On the whole, all that is saved in the

general disaster is gain. But we shall see. For McKinley him-

self, defeat, if it comes to him, is no serious disaster. The sober

second thought will perhaps elect him governor. The seesaw of

political life is to be counted on.





         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, November 4, 1890.

  GENTLEMEN:--I beg you to receive my thanks for an invita-

tion to attend the "Old Roman" banquet in honor of Allen G.

Thurman. Judge Thurman has a host of valid titles to the

admiration and regard of his countrymen.

  I have special reasons to recall with grateful feelings his

thoughtful kindness to me when as one of the judges of the

Supreme Court he heard my first case before that tribunal. May

he long live to enjoy the esteem and affection which are now

gathered around him.

  I regret that my engagements prevent me from being present

at the banquet.

                          Sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

   THE THURMAN CLUB,

     Columbus.



        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, November 5, 1890.

   MY DEAR SIR:--I thank you for your interesting and ex-

cellent brief in the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy. Without

investigation or serious thought about it, I have followed Haw-

thorne and Emerson, both of whom seemed fair-minded on the

 question. Your brief comes nearer to fixing my attention on

this head than anything I have read. Nothing yet said that I

 have seen has so staggered me as your facsimiles of the hand-

writing of Shakespeare. If authentic? Could a man who had

 written so much as appears to be his work at twenty-five or









             <B>DEMOCRATIC GAINS 1890          613</B>



thirty years of age do it with that hand? Could he have such

a hand? Perhaps so, but--

  Then your talk about his education and that of his family

and the will do suggest, if not compel, doubts.

  I have turned it over to my son, a lawyer of Toledo, who is

a devoted Shakespearean student and collector.

  With best wishes.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  EDWIN REED, ESQUIRE,

    Chicago.

  P.  S.--Your  commendation  of that Administration,  it is

pleasant to see.--Can you send me another copy? I want it

for a lady who reads and thinks--Mrs. John W.  Herron, of

Cincinnati.



  November 5.  Wednesday.--Last evening a meeting of the

official board of the church. A good attendance. Finance, the

business. A good spirit. Fourteen hundred dollars raised of the

seventeen or eighteen hundred we should raise. A general dis-

position to make it up. Kridler, now past seventy, spoke sensibly

about "educating the church to give." Mr. Emerson, a farmer

of Ballville, is one of the best and most sensible men in the

board.

  The election passed off quietly. A good vote polled. I have

as yet heard nothing, but I look for Democratic gains in all

quarters and a Democratic House.

  Am getting up my talk before the Congregational Club at

Chicago:--There are but two ways to preserve public order in

great nations. One is vast military establishments in time of

peace, and that mode every day grows less trustworthy, and

the other is absolute justice in the spirit of true fraternity among

men--in the spirit of the Golden Rule, and that with every

rolling year avails more and more. Indeed it is the only sure

reliance of civilized society.

  Let us all strive "to hasten the current of that stream of

tendency which makes for righteousness."









<B>614          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  November 6.  Thursday.--Today  the corner-stone of our

jail to be laid.  I will make my first speech in this town on one

of my hobbies, prison reform.

  Laura Mitchell came this evening. She will make us happy.

  November 10.  Monday.--I agreed to attend the Ohio So-

ciety in Chicago. . . . Wrote letters all of the forenoon;

too many for comfort. And how absurdly prolix many corre-

spondents are! One page is long enough.

  Read with Laura, or rather Laura read to me, from [Wil-

liam] Morris' "Wolfings."



                        SPIEGEL GROVE, November 10, 1890.

  In America the opportunities, the work, and the influence of

women grow wider and wider. Whether we like this tendency

or not, we cannot fail to see it.  We  ought to recognize it in

the training of our girls. The weak point in female education

in this country is the neglect of health. We have too much

bending over books and too little open-air exercise. Too many

studies, too little work and too little out-of-door play.

  My wish for the American woman is that she may always be

an elevating influence--man's inspiration.  Let him go forth

to duty while she weaves the spell which makes home a paradise

to which he may return, ever welcome, whether he is victor or

vanquished.

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

   Unaddressed.]



  November 11.  Tuesday. -- A  happy  visit with  Laura  to

Birchard and Mary and the two boys. All were in excellent

case.  .  .  . We returned before seven.  Read some chapters

of Morris' book. Correspondence, of course. A book on the

veto power, in which ample justice is done to me.  It is by Al-

bert Bushnell Hart. The first number of the "Harvard His-

torical Series."

  November 17. Monday.--Arrived at Chicago on time--be-

fore breakfast. At the Grand Pacific. Rained all day. Met









             <B>CONGREGATIONAL CLUB CHICAGO          615</B>



committee of Congregational Club, William Henry and Delavan

Smith, General Lake, and many others. At my room all day.

In the evening at the supper of the Congregational Club. Mr.

Wines with me during the day. He made a capital speech;

closed with a feeling tribute to Mrs. Hayes.

  I was introduced by Mr. Moore with words of welcome and

flattery. Well received. A fairish speech, offhand. Altogether

a gratification. At 10:40 Colonel Corbin saw me off. Met

McKinley; brave and cheerful over his defeat. A fine specimen

of all that he purports to be -- an American statesman.

  November 18.  Tuesday.--To Columbus.  Reached the of-

fice of Captain Cope, secretary of Ohio State University, at about

11 A. M. Godfrey and Schueller of the board present. Ad-

journed until 2:30 P. M.

   [At] 2:30 P. M. Godfrey, Schueller and now Wing and self

make a quorum. President Scott and Cope with us. An im-

portant meeting. My aim to get a renewed application for in-

dustrial education. The new grant from Congress of fifteen

thousand dollars a year, to be increased one thousand dollars a

year, is a handsome addition to our income. We divided between

equipment and new instruction.

  November 19.  Wednesday. -- Fine weather today and yester-

day. The board labored faithfully, joined by Miller and Massie,

and  were  reasonably successful.     The  industrial  department

agreed to; thirty thousand dollars for building; also fifty thou-

sand dollars for geological museum and library.

  November 24.  Monday. -- I by an oversight missed the Bible

meeting in the Episcopal church last night.  I am sorry.  I wanted

especially to attend. The religion of the Bible is the best in the

world. I see the infinite value of religion. Let it be always

encouraged. A world of superstition and folly have grown up

around its forms and ceremonies. But the truth in it is one of

the deep sentiments in human nature.

  Evening at the concert of the Schubert Quartette, of Chicago,

in the Presbyterian church. A very large and fine audience.

This is the first of a series of entertainments for the winter,

mostly popular lectures,--six for one dollar and twenty-five









<B>616          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



cents. An auspicious opening of the course. As usual in such

cases, learning that I was in the audience, the performers sent

word that they wished to pay their respects. A hand-shaking of

course. Agreeable people.

  During the day, correspondence. A little meditation on my

offhand talk to be given at the Ohio Society in Chicago. A brag

will be in order.

  November 25.  Tuesday. -- I paid three hundred dollars in

aid of Mrs. Noyes, widow of General E. F. Noyes, today in

check to Mr. W. Hooper. It will, I hope, with the amounts

subscribed by others give her a home. Also fifty dollars today

in aid of parsonage, etc., of the Episcopal church.

  Read up Ohio in the wars of the United States. I leave out

the civil side of this brilliant story, with Stanton and Chase and

the rest of our honored public men; with Bishop McIlvaine and

Bishop Simpson and the long line of eminent clergymen who in

the pulpit stimulated the patriotism of our country, and speak

only of those who on the battlefield upheld their country's cause.

  November 26.  Tuesday. -- Mrs. Davis tells this of Lucy, a

schoolgirl at the Wesleyan Female College. Lucy, a stranger, per-

haps homesick, with sparkling eyes and a beaming face said,

"Something is going to happen today." "Why, what is it, dear,"

said [a schoolmate] Mrs. Davis. "Mother is coming tonight,"

was the reply.

  Well, the darling daughter, Frances away from Spiegel two

months, since September 24, at Cincinnati, New York, Boston,

etc., will come home tonight!

  November 27.  Thursday.--The rich and the so-called for-

tunate owe a duty to the unfortunate. The first and by great

odds the chief duty is simple justice. They owe them just laws,

just methods of business, and a fair share of the good things of

the world, such as education, property, opportunity.

 December 2. Tuesday.--Returned last evening from Toledo

where I spent Sunday with Birchard and Mary and Sherman.

  In the evening of Thanksgiving on a sleeper for Chicago. At

Toledo Mr. Isaac N. Smead with his son came into the cars.

Pleasant chat until 10 P. M.  Slept as usual on the train--rest-









             <B>OHIO SOCIETY CHICAGO          617</B>



ful, somewhat wakeful, until called at early daylight by the

porter "near Chicago."  Was soon joined by a committee of the

Ohio Society who came out ten miles to meet me -- Major Wil-

liam E. Bliven and Mr. Jones. Escorted to pleasant quarters

at the Grand Pacific.    Breakfast with the two.     Soon after,

Colonel Corbin came. Walked over to the military headquarters.

Met there General Williams, General Miles, commander of the

Department or Division. General Miles talked of the Indian

troubles--the Messiah that had come to them.  He thinks the

army should have charge of the Indians. "You can't suddenly

turn them into farmers.  I saw a pile of ploughs that would do

in an old country where the ground has been broken for years,

but utterly worthless to break the hard ground of the dry West,"

etc A poor chance for the Indian to become civilized. "He gets

arms of the best patterns from the traders."

  Passed the Masonic building going up; of steel, to be eighteen

stories high. "Can't build much higher. The lower part too

dark," etc.

  Lunched with Judge Gresham and others (Major Butter-

worth) at Union League Club.  Judge Gresham is trying a

habeas corpus case.  A son-in-law of Judge Otis is imprisoned

for contempt in refusing to testify as to violations of the Inter-

state Commerce Law on the ground that it would criminate him-

self. The law has undertaken to relieve from danger by en-

acting that he cannot be injured by his testimony being used

against him.

  Major Butterworth told of a lunch when a few defeated Re-

publican Congressmen -- McKinley, C-, and another -- were

talking over their defeat.  McKinley said: "Oh well, we don't

care.  We'll soon get back."  "Oh, now," said C--, "none of that.

It is well enough to say that at home. But here among our-

selves we need not lie about it." Major Butterworth is capital

company in all such social gatherings; an able man, independent

to a degree that hurts him with the machine men.

  After lunch at my room. Slept and meditated my speech at

the Ohio Society banquet.

  In the evening with Judge Thoman to the parlors where for

an hour or more a stream of ladies and gentlemen were intro-









<B>618          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



duced to me. Miss Mary Ballard stood with me; Miss Mary

Otis, Miss Florence Smith, and a host of others. Among them

many old acquaintances. Escorted Mrs. Bliven to the dining

table. Sat at the right of the president (with Miss Florence

Smith between Thoman and me). After the banquet I spoke

thirty minutes and Major Butterworth ten or twelve. Dancing

by the young folks.

  Judge Thoman called early Saturday morning and saw me

on the cars--8 A. M.  Reached Toledo about 4 P. M.  [At]

the home of Birchard wrote the short speech introducing [Henry

M.] Stanley to the audience at the People's Theatre in the

evening.

   [At] 7:30 drove to the Boody House. Met there Major Pond,

the agent of the lecturer. Was taken to the room of Stanley.

Sat with him alone a few minutes. He is short, long-bodied, but

lower limbs short, strongly built; face healthily florid, hair gray,

with bright, friendly expression.  Easy and agreeable in con-

versation, inviting confidence; very pleasant, said: "You would

like to see Mrs. Stanley." She came in with him, a handsome,

stylish young woman, English rosy complexion, a head taller

than Stanley; converses in a handsome lively way. Her mother,

Mrs. Tennant, a well-preserved, cordial person.

  We soon walked together, led by Major Pond, three squares

to the theatre. As soon as ready there (wraps off and the like),

Stanley and I walked on to the stage alone; sat a moment on the

sofa. I introduced him. He put on an easel his manuscript in

large, coarse handwriting; stood erect, after a bow and moderate

applause, and spoke rather too low--decidedly too low tones --

but with good elocution, manner, and pronunciation, reading not

at all. The lecture, so called, was so well committed that he

delivered it as if offhand conversation. He did not need his

manuscript. The matter was too much of his opinions of and

relations with Emin Pasha and too little of his travels, of Africa,

and of his adventures.

  Sunday, at the Triangle.  Walked with Mary to her church--

Congregational. Heard Mr. Williams the pastor preach a good,

sensible sermon on the text, "Ethiopia shall stretch out her

hands," etc. A hopeful talk on the negro.









             <B>HENRY M. STANLEY AT TOLEDO          619</B>



  Monday, called on my old friend [Clark] Waggoner.  Talked

of his fight with the Standard Oil Company on the pipe-line

question. Hopes with confidence that the city will succeed in

getting a good supply of cheap gas (three cents per thousand

feet), and that the Standard will sell out their plant--their

pipes in the streets.  We shall see.  Also [of] his successful

fight against Ashley. Afternoon, with Birchard home.

  December 3.  Wednesday. -- Emerson says:  "Why  nature

loves number five."    Why I love number one:  I was elected

city solicitor thirty or forty years ago by one majority--the

best lawyer's office in Cincinnati at the time -- at a time of life

when one's first office tastes sweet in the mouth.

  Dr. William K. Rogers, Jr., came from Columbus. Mrs.

Rogers [his mother] had seen a notice of the sale of the Hayes

Block [in Duluth] at a low figure; knew my old friend was

in the bank of Hall and Company that recently failed; fears her

estate in Rogers' name may be involved in the catastrophe. I

don't see how we can lose the Hayes Block or be involved with-

out my hearing of it.  W. K. Rogers is totally unfit to cope

with business and business men.  He is easily duped; trusts all

men who profess friendship; in short, needs a guardian in all

business matters. He seems to lack a sense of duty and re-

sponsibility.  Withal a good man, of culture, of ability, and

the talents that would fit him for a professorship in a college.

I wired R. P. [Rutherford, who is visiting Duluth] in Scott's

name:    "How  are  you?  What  is  the  situation?         Reply

promptly."  No answer as yet.  Young Dr. Rogers seems all he

should be. Intelligent; appreciates his father's worth and weak-

ness.  I hope Mrs. Rogers' property is not lost and that my

own is in no trouble. But I am somewhat anxious about it.

  With Dr. Rogers visited the new opera house.  It may be

ready to occupy in a month or six weeks. It promises very well.

  Correspondence and my books. The Northwestern Congrega-

tionalist, of St. Paul, contains a stenographic report of my speech

on Prison Reform before the Congregational Club of Chicago.

It looks well in print; is perhaps my best speech on the question.









<B>620          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  December 7. Sunday. -- Webb came early and went to church

with me. Our new pastor preached a warm, earnest, eloquent

sermon to a full church. Talked with Webb on Dr. R. S.

Storrs' sermon on Thanksgiving Day. The wickedness of our

system of gathering wealth into a few hands, leaving a multi-

tude, of necessity, in want.  Webb left about 4 P. M. after a

good visit. In the evening Rutherford came after a happy trip.

He found our affairs at Duluth in quite as good a condition as

he expected. The prospect of "the farm," as city property, is

good; would sell now for one hundred thousand dollars to one

hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. Rogers well and

doing well.

  December 8. Monday. -- Rutherford brought home another

book of William Morris. He thought as it is on the right side

of some parts of the labor question that I would like it. It is

entitled "News from Nowhere, or an Epoch of Rest." It treats

of the "Solidarity of Labor." But it is not well done. Its talk

of marriage is loose. Its use of low words and phrases is fre-

quent. Not a book up to the subject nor equal to the author's

other works.



                               FREMONT, December 8, 1890.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I congratulate you on the completion of your

wonderful work, "The Genesis of the United States." The col-

lection and preparation for the press of such a mountain of

materials and host of interesting and rare portraits and maps

make the beautiful volumes you have published an unique addi-

tion to our early history. I cannot speak of the contents of the

volumes except from a very hasty and cursory examination.

  I am confident that your work will prove of great and per-

manent value.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  ALEXANDER BROWN.



  December 9. Tuesday. -- No author, but I have written a

good deal--mostly trash--that has been printed.  As a mem-









             <B>DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH          621</B>



ber of the American Historical Association, I am called on by

Paul Leicester Ford to furnish a list of my published writings.

Rutherford has got it ready and will send it as requested.

  December 10.  Wednesday.--The wealth of our country is

increasing rapidly and enormously. The question of its distribu-

tion presses more and more urgently. The great question in our

day and generation plainly is the property question--the ques-

tion of wealth. Shall it be held, controlled, owned by a few?

Or shall it be wisely, equitably, that is widely distributed?

More and more, wealth gives power, estimation, reputation.

Shall only a few have it? Wealth, education, opportunity,

power, go together. Shall they belong to a few, or to the many?

They will rule always in a free country. Who shall rule, the

few or the many, a plutocracy or a democracy?  That is the

question.

  In the evening met Colonel Brigham and Mr. Williams at the

depot. They want Chamberlain to be president of the Ohio

University.  It will strengthen it with the farmers; make it,

in fact, a mechanics and farmers' college, and gain thus in the

Legislature the needed votes for its liberal support.  This is

their argument.  They say Mr. Wing is with them and that

Massie will probably aid. Godfrey will on personal grounds

oppose, they say. I gave them no assurance; would consider it,

try to hear the case impartially. [I] believe in making the col-

lege a people's college, a college for farmers and mechanics in

the best sense--something different from the common, old-

fashioned classical college. The truth is, I fear Chamberlain is

not large enough in head and character for the place.  But-?

  Webb and Mr. Lawrence came over to see into the difficulty

of the Carbon Company works here. The natural gas company

has suddenly cut off the supply of gas from  the factories. They

have so extended their pipes to Detroit, Sandusky, and Nor-

walk that they can only supply gas for domestic purposes. They

find this more profitable. They induced the factories to come

to this region, and now for gain destroy them! This is mo-

nopoly. Hateful always.

  In the evening discussed magnetism, the human article, with









<B>622          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Mr. Lawrence.     There is in it much--mostly mystery--we

agree.

  December 11.  Thursday.--In  the evening attended a full

meeting of the post. It is a happiness to see the joy it gives the

old fellows simply to meet together, irrespective of what is done

or said. Officers all elected by acclamation. Captain Young

bubbled over with happiness seeing the harmony of the "old

post." I was with Greene elected delegate to the state encamp-

ment.

  Our banks all a little nervous. Rutherford goes to Cleveland

to see if he can get cash if needed for a run on the savings

bank of which he is cashier. He does not wish to give the sixty

days' notice if he can avoid it.

  December  12.  Friday.--I am  "a radical in thought (and

principle) and a conservative in method" (and conduct). . . .

An address of President White, "Evolution and Revolution,"

contains sound and liberal talk. "Righteousness exalteth a na-

tion." "Righteousness means rightness, right doing, right deal-

ing, the cultivation of this in the individual and in society." "To

do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God."

  E. W. Bemis on socialism writes well. State action, state

regulation, state control, are his words. Not state socialism, nor

communism, nor nihilism which is anarchy.

  The unrestricted competition so commonly advocated does

not leave us the survival of the fittest. The unscrupulous suc-

ceed best in accumulating wealth.

  December 13.--Clear, lovely winter morning.        I have often

thought of watching a sunrise and trying to describe in cold

black ink its brilliant glories. This morning, about half past

six, the rosy blush spread over the sky near the evergreens at

the small southeast gate. By 6:45 the colors were in strata and

so remained with small change for fifteen minutes, viz., first

at the earth, lowest, a stream of rosy golden, irregular in width,

apparently ten to fifteen feet, then a stream of blue, or light

greenish blue, about as wide as the golden below, then golden

and rosy again extending laterally north and south for perhaps

three or four hundred yards, then blue and again rosy shading









             <B>EQUAL RIGHTS OF ALL MEN          623</B>



off to leaden-colored sky.  At 7:15 the first fiery red of the

upper rim of the sun appeared among the evergreens; the streams

of alternate blue and rosy disappeared, and the whole southeast

sky, up forty or fifty feet or more, was brilliantly and beauti-

fully rosy and silver; and higher up the clouds, each a bundle,

became also a rosy silver. About 7:20, the whole round fiery

red sun was above the horizon and the light of day rapidly drove

away the rosy golden colors with the silver sheen, and the world

was awake. While I wrote this the sun has passed under clouds

and the appearance at the evergreen trees and north and south

of them now is a stream of six to ten feet wide all along the

horizon of blue; then four to ten feet of brilliantly rosy red, and

above it a dull leaden blue up to the white blue of the sky.

Broad daylight and I turn off the gas.

  December 15. Monday. -- Democracy and Republicanism in

their best partisan utterances alike declare for human rights.

Jefferson, the father of Democracy, Lincoln, the embodiment

of Republicanism, and the Divine author of the religion on which

true civilization rests, all proclaim the equal rights of all men.

  December 16.  Tuesday. -- The sudden death of an excellent

man; not an intimate friend, but one always esteemed, Henry

C. Noble, Esq., of Columbus. He and his wife were among the

friends who went with us to Washington in 1877. They were

with us returning in 1881. Lucy and Mrs. Noble were good

friends, not intimate. Mr. and Mrs. Noble came to her funeral.

I wrote today a note of sympathy to Mrs. Noble. Remember-

ing the comfort I got from kind words about Lucy, I praised

Mr. Noble; not extravagantly but judiciously, as I could truth-

fully do.



        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 16, 1890.

  MY DEAR MRS. NOBLE:--I have learned that it is pleasant to

know that others appreciate the virtues of those we have loved

and lost, and this comfort surely is yours. Your husband, in

sterling worth, was a rare man indeed.  He was able, honorable,

and so trustworthy and good. You need not be told of his ex-

cellence. You know it better than others. I but express briefly









<B>624          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and feebly what his whole circle of friends and acquaintances

would wish you to know they feel. God grant you His support

in these desolate days is the prayer of all of his friends and of

yours,

       Sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

   MRS. HENRY C. NOBLE,

     Columbus.



  December 17.  Wednesday.--Reading all that I can get hold

of on the negro question. I find nothing which overthrows or

even tends to overthrow the position that education will help

him wherever he needs help, will strengthen [him] where he is

weak, and will aid him to overcome all evil tendencies. The

question then is how best to educate him.

  To Cleveland this afternoon.

  December 18.  Thursday.--With D. Z. Norton visited the

"University School" of Anderson. It is on a plan that strikes

me favorably. It has as its course for eight years, ten to eigh-

teen, training "all around," so arranged as to interest and enlist

the boys in the work. Work, industrial; sports, baseball, foot-

ball, and the like; studies; swimming, skating, and gymnastics;

lunch, a simple meal at the school. Boys are weighed, measured,

inspected, their defects noted.  Exercises fitted to correct de-

fects, forty-five minutes to one hour. Rest is doing something

else. Dined with Mrs. Norton and Mrs. Castle (1398 Euclid).

Spent the evening with Mrs. Austin and Mattie.

  December 19. Friday.--I called yesterday on Mr. Covert

of the Leader; gave him the report of Comrades Alfred Arthur

and David Kimberley of their capture of one hundred and forty-

five rebels in the Morgan raid near Buffington, Ohio. Published

in the Leader today. Also talked over the Mohonk Negro Con-

ference. . . . This afternoon to Sandusky.  At the Soldiers'

Home welcomed by General and Mrs. Force and the fine boy

Horton. Mrs. Horton is as ever an angelic old lady. A good

visit throughout. "As if in camp again," among the veterans

and the general's books and with the general.









             <B>DEATH OF DR. JOHN DAVIS          625</B>



  December 22.--In the evening, a quarterly conference meet-

ing. The returns of collections not as good as they should be.

Mr. Albritton a good deal discouraged. Made a gloomy talk,

chiefly on the point of the discords in the church. Mr. Kridler

thought the picture too dark. No other one spoke. Seeing we

were about to adjourn in a downhearted state of mind, I made

an earnest appeal for better feeling, criticized the pastor for

"showing the white feather"--a phrase he had used--and

complimented him warmly on his sermons; told him how he

was uplifting us all, referred to the time of year as a hard one

for raising money, and the year itself as a year of unusual

money depression. The effect of the talk was good. I called

for a rising vote in favor of harmony and of sustaining our

pastor. It was carried with much good feeling. We adjourned

feeling well--better than at any time for a year or more.

  December 24. Wednesday.--Read Emerson on Montaigne,

Shakespeare, and Napoleon this week. Began "A Dream by a

Modest Prophet," by General Leggett.

  December 25.  Thursday.--  .  .  .  A happy Christmas

day [at Toledo] with our excellent hosts, Birchard and Mary.

But all day I was thinking of the dear one gone.

  December 26. Friday. -- We hear that our old friends in Cin-

cinnati, the Davises, [who] had their usual happy Christmas,

with probably Huntington and Adda of the party, were plunged

into sorrow by the sudden death of Dr. John Davis. About nine

he died.  Fanny and I will go down tomorrow.  They were of

our nearest Cincinnati friends. They were at our wedding; en

route to Washington with us in 1877; at the silver wedding De-

cember 30, 1877; returned with the party of our friends when we

left Washington in 1881, and were at the funeral of Lucy in

1889. He was true and warm in his friendship. Mrs. Davis

wrote the missionary "In Memoriam" of Lucy and succeeded

Lucy as President of the Woman's Home Missionary [Society].

A long list of events marks the intimacy and long continuance

of our friendship.

<B>626          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                        FREMONT, OHIO, December 26, 1890.

  MY DEAR DOCTOR: -- I send you the long delayed letter of Mr.

Evarts, merely that you may see it. It does not change facts.

The affair is finally settled greatly to my satisfaction, and most

beneficially, I am confident, for the cause.

  I hear from Lake Mohonk that they fear you cannot attend

the next Conference on the Negro Question. I hope you will

strain all points to get there.  We have now reached the time

when both sides of the old line can shut their eyes to the blunders

and offenses of the past and deal exclusively with the present

and the future. There is enough ill nature in official bodies --

enough raking up of the past in Congress and in the press, -- to

make it very desirable to have one example of a harmonious

meeting of the representatives of all sections to discuss the in-

teresting problem. Of course there will be discords, but we may

hope that the prevailing temper will be good.

  The sudden death of an intimate friend in Cincinnati calls

me there at once.

  With all best wishes to Mrs. Curry and yourself.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  DR. J. L. M. CURRY.



  December 27.  Saturday.--With Frances reached Cincinnati

about 10 P. M. Rooms good but cold -- very. The hasty fire

barely touched the climate. A deep snow.

  December 28.  Sunday. -- In Cincinnati, Burnet House; cold

and clear; eight inches snow here. After a good breakfast we

walked in the clear, crisp air to 323 Elm street, Aunty Davis'

--alone now! Dr. Davis died almost instantly--a bursted blood

vessel in the brain--after a most happy Christmas with family

and guests. All kissed him under the mistletoe, and then! He

went upstairs with Huntington to smoke, had a short spell of

coughing, in a few minutes was no more. Born January 4, 1821,

would have been seventy in a few days. Funeral: first, private,

at the house, then at the church. Many (five) speakers. One









             <B>CHARACTER OF DR. DAVIS          627</B>



took as initials of his virtues the letters which spell CHRIST --

viz., conscientiousness, humility, reverence, intrepidity, simplic-

ity, trustworthiness. Others left the impression of his excellent

life and character.  .  .  . Evening again with Auntie Davis.

She was calm,--but what to do?  A  large house, alone; or

must she load herself with the care of a houseful of relatives?

Sad, indeed.

  December 30.  Tuesday.--Thirty-eight years ago my  wed-

ding! Lucy! . . .

  December 31.  Wednesday.--Visited today by a comrade of

the Twenty-third, Harrison Brown, Company B, now living at

Jefferson, Ohio. He lost his left arm by a shot at an impudent

rebel prisoner in Camp Chase on the dead line, or past it. The

shot barely grazed the man shot at and after crushing Brown's

arm is now in his hip.  He is a powerful man; has double

teeth all round; wants and deserves a pension.  Was a wild

boy; grossly insulted by his sergeant, he knocked him down,

and was sent three months to Camp Chase.

  I sent "Jane Eyre" and "David Copperfield" to his daughter,

a thirteen-year old. I must, if he gets his pension, tell him to

come to our reunions at Lakeside.

  January 1, 1891.  Thursday.--A  time to pause, to cast up

accounts, to recall the past year, to plan for the new year, to

make good resolutions.  Walter Scott in his "Journal," January

1, 1826, says:--"A year has passed -- another has commenced.

These solemn divisions of time influence our feelings as they

recur.  Yet there is nothing  in it; for every day in the year

closes a twelvemonth as well as the 31st of December.         The

latter is only the solemn pause, as when a guide, showing a wild

and mountainous road, calls on a party to pause and look back

at the scenes which they have just passed.  To me this new

year opens sadly."

  Last evening I intended to look in on the last meeting of the

year in our Methodist church to see if it was observed as it

was when I was young. Then the old year was "watched out"

and the New Year was "watched in" with prayers, hymns, and









<B>628          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



solemn  exhortations.   Those meetings  were often  very im-

pressive and solemn. But stopping a little before nine o'clock

the lights were put out and prayer-meeting over.

  The happy old custom of New Year's calling by gentlemen

has  nearly  disappeared. . . .   I read  Walter  Scott's

"Gurnal," as he often spells it, [and] newspapers, and wrote a

few letters. I did not make as many calls as I intended. . . .

General Buckland and I talked over the usual topics. We nat-

urally drifted into the war. The famous cold New Year's day

of the war, January 1, 1864, was referred to. He was at

Memphis. In a few hours [the mercury fell] from 70 degrees + to

16 degrees +. He told of his surprise that old Mrs. Harring-

ton in 1837 should recall his father, Sergeant Ralph Buckland,

as a soldier of the war of 1812 and talk of him as she worked

at weaving. It was only twenty-five years past; and here we

are talking of the beginning of the war almost thirty years ago as

if it happened last week.

  January 2. Friday.--In the evening heard a lecture to a

large audience in the Presbyterian church by Major H. C.

Dane, of Boston, on the naval battles of the Rebellion. It was

well done, and delighted the audience. The three battles de-

scribed were the Monitor fight with Merrimac, March 9,

Sunday, 1862, the capture of New Orleans, and the battle of

Mobile Bay, August 5, 1864. The whole lecture was spirited,

graphic, and extremely interesting. In regard to the battle in

Hampton Roads, the new point was that the arrival of the

Monitor was an accident (?). No order or advice sent her

there. I mean, no order from Government. She was to make

a trial trip from New York and return. But she sailed down

the New Jersey coast; stopped over night; came within sound

of the guns of the battle and Worden sailed towards the fight.

The battle of Mobile Bay was, according to Major Dane, the

turning-point. If it had failed, intervention would have ruined

the Union cause. Doubtful. But it was a great battle. De-

scribing the horror of these sea fights as he did, the wonder is

that so few comparatively are lost. The proportion of killed

and wounded is less than in land fighting.









             <B>MONITOR AND MERRIMAC          629</B>



  January 3. Saturday.--Emerson says: "In Europe crime

is observed to increase or abate with the price of bread."

  Crimes increase as education, opportunity, and property de-

crease. Whatever spreads ignorance, poverty, and discontent

causes crime.

  Who are guilty? Criminals have their own responsibility,

their own share of guilt, but they are merely the hand. The

brains that contrive and control have also their responsibility,

their share of guilt.

  Whoever interferes with equal rights and equal opportunities

is in some sense, in some degree, some real degree, responsible

for the crimes committed in the community.

  January 4.  Sunday.--Webb made us happy by appearing

at breakfast this morning. He always makes the day joyous

with his spirit and cheerful and entertaining talk.

[With him] discussed the statement of the lecturer, Major Dane,

that the Monitor did not sail from New York for Hampton

Roads, but was under orders to make a trial trip and return

to New York. Now, in the "Battles and Leaders of the Civil

War," by the Century Company, we find a totally different ac-

count, [showing clearly that the Monitor was ordered to Hamp-

ton Roads. This account was] written by S. Dana Greene,

Commander United States Navy, who was the second in com-

mand -- the executive officer -- of the Monitor in the battle with

the Merrimac. He says there were fifty-eight men all told on the

Monitor. What other fifty-eight men, what other so insignificant

force, ever fought so momentous a battle? . . .

  January 5. Monday.--Sent to War Department -- Major

Davis of the "War Records"--a box containing three or four

books, copies of letters, endorsements, orders, reports of the

brigade in [the] Department of West Virginia commanded by

me in 1863 and 1864 and by H. F. Devol in 1865, together with

papers of that period.

  Read Walter Scott's "Journal," Woodberry's "Talks with

Emerson," and the "Life of R. H. Dana" by Charles F. Adams.

   January 6.  Tuesday. -- During the night felt uncomfortable;

took a small glass of Sauterne; was wakeful; thought for a long

time of Lucy--her wonderful career, capacities, and how she

touched closely such a vast variety of people and of life; her

travels, her recollections of events, scenes, and characters! A

wife, mother, grandmother, as a woman; her child history, with

a widowed mother, in narrow circumstances; her life in the

country  with  her  grandfather  and  grandmother--and  her

famous uncles, in Chillicothe, the ancient metropolis of Ohio,

with its able men and attractive and noted women; her visits to

Kentucky, both in the country and in Lexington; her going to

college and mingling with the boy students, with the cronies of

her two brothers, the only girl in the Ohio Wesleyan University

at Delaware; her life in Cincinnati, where she knew both the

humble and the upper four hundred; her life at the Ohio Wes-

leyan Female College; married life in Cincinnati with a young

lawyer, slowly rising; her growing family of boys, with at last

one daughter; the war which she was in the midst of, in camps,

in tents, in newly-built log cabins, in hospitals of sick, of

freshly wounded,  in the  mountains  of  West  Virginia near

Hawk's Nest, in the Kanawha Valley, in Maryland near

Antietam, in Frederick City, Washington, Baltimore, where-

ever camps and hospitals were found; the wife of a Member of

Congress during the exciting scenes of the reconstruction period,

knowing and meeting all the noted generals and statesmen; sit-

ting up all night in the House of Representatives to see the bills

passed in spite of "filibustering" over the vetoes of President

Johnson; once the first person to enter with her husband the

great reception of General Grant in 1866 (this done purposely

to see the whole affair); a trip of ten days or more with a Con-

gressional party to see the South in the holidays of 1865-6.

visiting Lynchburg, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville, Memphis,

Jackson, New Orleans, with Vice-President Foster, Senators

Wade, Lane, Ramsay, Norton and Members of Congress and

their wives; having visited Richmond (just after the close of

the great conflict), and Petersburg, with passes from General

Grant which enabled her to see all of the awful desolation,

spending days in Richmond and Petersburg; having seen the

Grand Review in May in Washington; at Columbus three terms

of the governorship, having passed through exciting campaigns;

engaged in the benevolent enterprises of the time; always at

home with the inmates of the Deaf and Dumb, [the] Blind,

[and the] Imbecile [Asylums]; [the] Reformatory and other

State institutions; a traveller, familiar with all parts of the

United States; down the St. Lawrence several times before her

husband was known in public life; on the Mississippi from the

twin cities to New Orleans; on the lakes and the connecting

rivers from Duluth at the west end of Lake Superior to the

mouth of the St. Lawrence; on the Atlantic ocean from Port-

land to Fortress Monroe; on the Pacific from the Straits of

Fuca and Puget Sound to San Francisco; in every great city

of the country; familiar with all sorts and descriptions of men

and women, farmers, mechanics, artists, scholars, authors, clergy-

men, miners, ranchmen, sailors, fishermen, cowboys, soldiers,

camp followers, hospital people, the very poor and the very rich;

acquainted with all that comes to those who pass through the

most exciting contests in political life,--the contest of 1876,

the nomination, the long and doubtful canvass, the disputed

result; the life in the White House during four years; the life

of a retired ex-President in the old home at Spiegel Grove;

mingling freely always with the religious, the benevolent, the

fashionable, and the giddy; fond of all rational sports, games,

pleasures, and excitements; a matchless fisherwoman; delighted

with all fine animals and knowing them; in love with flowers,

gardening, and farming, and always and everywhere at home;

easily made happy, and with the faculty never excelled of mak-

ing all around her happy--always doing it; equally welcome

and prized in the house of affliction and suffering and in the

 scenes of gay life; knowing more people, and known to more

people than, perhaps, any other woman of her time [or] that ever

 lived;--is it strange that one so beloved by such multitudes

 should have been mourned when she died?  What tributes came

 from the press, the pulpit, by letter, by resolutions of all sorts

and with a will and desire to make happy, never found in greater

measure in any human being.

          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 6, 1891.

  DEAR MADAM:--Your favor of the first instant is before me.

I am confident that the governor of New York [David B. Hill]

will give due attention to the facts you spread before him in be-

half of the application for pardon you refer to.  It is a mistake

to call on strangers in distant States to express opinions on

ex-parte statements. The tendency is to injure your case. It

looks as if you were relying on personal influence, clamor, in-

stead of the merits of your case. I must, therefore, decline, re-

spectfully, to comply with your request.

                          Sincerely,

          RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. ADA SPRINGER.



  January 7. Wednesday.--About midnight I heard Scott at

the telephone. He was receiving from the telegraph office a

message announcing the death of Charles Devens in Boston. I

could not learn if any particulars were given. The phone was

working badly. General Devens was a member of my Cabinet.

He has been for some years a judge of the Supreme Court of

Massachusets. He was a model gentleman. He was a bachelor.

He was an orator, a soldier of credit, carried a Rebel bullet in

his body, was much honored  for character, ability, and life.

Lucy admired him; we were all fond of him. I would like to

attend the funeral. Many engagements are in the way. But I

would try to arrange them, if it were not for the inclement

Eastern winter which we hear of, and for the chance of losing

time and health on snow-bound trains. I sent the following

dispatch in the morning:--

  "I mourn the death of my trusted and true friend General

Charles Devens. He was eminent in his profession. He was

a patriotic soldier and a wise counsellor. He will always be

remembered by those who knew him as a noble gentleman. I

regret exceedingly that I cannot attend the funeral."









             <B>DEATH OF GENERAL DEVENS          633</B>



  January 8. Thursday. -- I began with Lucy Keeler the work

of selecting tributes to Lucy for the sketch of her for Howe's

"Historical Collections." No easy job in the abundance of

material. It is probable that these tributes were to be found

in many thousands of the newspapers and periodicals of the

United States. Few and rare were the newspapers in which

they did not appear. It has been said that "perhaps no woman

that ever lived was so widely known and so widely mourned

when she died as Mrs. Hayes."

  In the evening I attended the G. A. R. meeting and saw the new

officers installed. Called upon for a talk, I gave them an ac-

count of the death and services of General Devens. I go this

afternoon to the Soldiers' Home at Sandusky.

  January 9. Friday. -- Attended a campfire in the great din-

ing-room of the Soldiers and Sailors' Home where a large as-

semblage of the veterans and citizens of Sandusky were gath-

ered.  There was a good glee club.

  I spoke third and made the longest speech of the evening--

perhaps fifty minutes. It was well received. I was content with

this my first speech this new year.

  January 11. Sunday.--I have this morning written many

letters and am now square with correspondents. I decline all

invitations on my table today: To Ohio banquet in New York

next month; to Loyal Legion ditto, ditto; to Detroit Congrega-

tional Club.

  Now  I take up the sketch, etc., for Lucy--the darling!--

for Mr. Howe's "Collections." A gossippy book, but enough of

the solid to make its biography and history valuable.

  [Columbus], January 14.--A good meeting of the board of

trustees [of the State University].  Got a full resolution for

forty thousand dollars for industrial training.

  January 15.  Thursday.--The  [natural] gas going--gone.

The event and the sorrow of the time.--To Auntie Austin's,

Cleveland.

  January 17.  Saturday.--With Mrs. Herron to Fremont.









<B>634          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  January 18.  Sunday.--Steady winter weather.  With Mrs.

Herron all day, reading, etc. No church.





Private.

          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 19, 1891.

  MY DEAR SENATOR:--This reply to your letter is for your

own eyes alone. Governor Foster has been totally misinformed.

His opinions on the situation here are sheer nonsense.  This is

an enthusiastic soldier town.     To  appoint McCulloch  [post-

master] would offend the whole soldier sentiment and would

make a muss.  They  are both fair men personally, but for

months  it has been generally understood  that  Mr.  Louden-

schlager would be appointed. The appointment of Mr. Louden-

schlager would be satisfactory. He took no particular pains

to pile up papers. Within a week or two industrious efforts

have been made by other candidates. Petitions have been got

up. People signed freely to get rid of importunity. Letters

are given carelessly. But all will be well the moment that

Loudenschlager is appointed.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT. OHIO, January 22, 1891.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--It is and has been one of my vanities

to keep engagements. I have practiced it. But now, for reasons

I need not detail, I may not do it. You can't count on me ab-

solutely. For this, as one principal reason, I did not venture

to commit myself to come to the memorial service as the orator

of the occasion. Again, I cannot, and ought not to undertake

the principal--the formal address.  If on thinking it over you

find it worth while, I can speak ten or twelve minutes. Let

Senator Hoar, or some companion of the [Loyal] Legion, deliver

THE address, and let it be so understood. If this suits, you may

be sure I will come if I can any day from February 24 to March

20 which you may select.  Now, don't let this interfere with your









             <B>FAULTS OF FIXED PRIESTHOOD          635</B>



plans. You must drop me out if my suggestion in the least

embarrasses.<B>*</B>



  January 23. Friday.--Mrs. Herron returned this morning

to her Cincinnati home after a visit we enjoyed so much. I

accompanied her to Toledo. Birchard, Mary, and the fine boy

met us at the station. After a few minutes the train started

with my most prized friend among all the living. I went to the

Triangle, dined, [and] remained until it was time for the eve-

ning train.

  January 24. Saturday. -- The church and the clergy do good;

how much we do not know, probably cannot appreciate. Emer-

son says the sermon and the Sabbath are great gains for which

we are indebted to the church. There are many others. The

harm of a fixed professional priesthood is due to that principle

which leads all men to exaggerate--to  magnify their office.

This leads them to increase the list of acts which they teach are

sinful. This, when it increases their own power. In like man-

ner they neglect to urge as essential virtues elements of character

and conduct which tend to weaken their influence, or which do

not enlarge it.

  Touching temperance, there is in this country, at least, no half-

way house between total abstinence and the wrong side of the

question.

  January 29. Thursday.--Finished a little talk for the West-

ern Reserve University inauguration at Cleveland February 4.

One idea in the line of my nihilism I get in, viz., that property

is a trust for the welfare of the public.





                          FREMONT, OHIO, January 30, 1891.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am informed that it has been reported in

the House of Representatives that (presumably by reason of

my connection with the Ohio Wesleyan and the Western Re-

serve Universities) I am opposed to the permanent provision

man of the committee at Boston engaged in arranging for public services

proposed by means of an annual tax for "the Ohio State Uni-

versity Fund." This is a total mistake. The higher education,

has been neglected in Ohio. Industrial education is greatly neg-

lected. I earnestly hope that every friend of either will support

the measure.                Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE SAMUEL M. TAYLOR,

    Columbus.



  February 1. Sunday.--Walked as usual on the porch im-

mediately after rising; usually walk half, two-thirds, or a full

mile before breakfast. Do it at the rate of a mile in twenty

minutes--three miles an hour.

  Mr. Albritton is having a very successful "season" of awaken-

ing in our church. He fills the church full. All of the back-

sliding or cold members seem to be interested, good numbers

are crowding to the altar, and many give their names to the

church.



              SPIEGEL, FREMONT, OHIO, February 3, 1891.

  DEAR MRS. HERRON:--I go this morning on the early train

to Cleveland to the inauguration of President Thwing of the

Western Reserve University. Various claims on my time have

prevented me from writing notes on your brother Clinton's

favorite essay--"Self-Reliance."  This is not my first reading

of it.  But I did not before fully appreciate its wisdom--in-

sight--intuition.  The last half or one-third of it is in Emer-

son's best spirit. It is worth dwelling on. It does satisfy. In

it he repeats his idea of the answer to the questions -- Whence?

Whither?--as clearly as such transcendent thoughts can be ex-

pressed in finite terms by finite beings.

  What a lift--something more than rest--your presence and

our sympathizing reading on high themes has given me! Thank

you. The bell rings and I go in haste.

                      With all thanks.

                                   RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. HARRIET C. HERRON,

    Cincinnati.









             <B>WEALTH AND POVERTY          637</B>



  February 6. -- Returned from Cleveland on mail train reach-

ing home soon after 4 P. M., after a fine visit at Aunty Austin's.

  The burning question of our time in all civilized countries is

the question of wealth and poverty, of capital and labor. Small

progress has yet been made towards its solution.  Why?  Be-

cause ignorance and not intelligence has taken hold of it. The

potent objection, the stronghold of the existing injustice is the

futility, not to say folly, of the remedies which ignorance is

able to contrive. Let men both intelligent and true to the in-

terests of the laborer take up the problem. All fair-minded

men admit that labor does not now get its fair share of the

wealth it creates. All see that wealth is not justly distributed.

Let education send into our society a body of laborers educated

and intelligent--able to deal with this grave question.

  February 7. Saturday. -- Last Tuesday on early train to

Cleveland, so as to attend the funeral of Captain C. H. Morgan

of the Twenty-third O. V. I. Snow, wind, bitterly cold.

A short service and talk in the cold [cemetery] chapel. Cap-

tain Morgan's wife and mother and children from Buffalo pres-

ent. At the grave I spoke in two sentences the comrades' sor-

row, and their sympathy with the widow and orphans.

  Wednesday at 11 A. M. [the] board of trustees of the col-

lege [met]. President Thwing all ready with docket and in a

prompt and businesslike way dispatched all that came before

us. He, the president, appeared to great advantage. A good

executive.

  [At] 3 P. M. in the new Young Men's Christian Association's

hall, speaking by President Haydn, retiring, President Eliot,

of Harvard, Mr. McGiffert, and others, and myself for the

trustees. All passed off well.

  Evening, 7:30, at the banquet at the Stillman. I spoke in a

jocular vein; Dr. Haydn, with wit; President Thwing, soberly,

impressively, and admirably.

  February 10.  Tuesday.--W. K. Rogers came as I was taking

my  walk  on  the  porch  before  breakfast.  He  is  [here]

to have Mrs. Rogers buy with me Mrs. Webb's one-third of the

Duluth block for twelve thousand dollars. It is no speculation









<B>638          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



but seems best in order to give us full control of it. We talked

over old times, Mr. Evarts' vanity, etc., and his kindness, good

nature, and agreeable ways. Also of Windom.

  February 11. Wednesday. -- In the evening a rumor of Gen-

eral Sherman's death. He has had erysipelas for some days.

All beneath my roof are full of admiration and affection for you,

dear General. He is the most interesting and original character

now living in the world.

  February 12.  Thursday.--The news from General Sherman

is this morning: "The physicians have given up all hope. It is

only a question of hours." Alas!--He was loved and admired

by Lucy. He was my friend. Long before any other prominent

man, he said: "Our next President should be one of the volun-

teers, a man of character, a soldier of approved record, a man

like Governor Hayes of Ohio." He was with us on our famous

trip to California and Puget Sound in 1880. What kind words

he wrote about Lucy!

  Spoke at 4 P. M. to a large audience of students, professors,

and a few citizens at Oberlin. Passed off well.

  Cleveland, February 14.  Saturday.--General Sherman died

at 1:50 P. M. Sent dispatch to Senator John Sherman -- con-

dolence. In the evening gave the Leader and [the] Plain Dealer

one-third of a column interview on General Sherman.

  February 15.  Sunday.--At 2 P. M. at the Stillman.  Pre-

sided and spoke on General Sherman to the Companions of the

Loyal Legion. Read the letter on the death of his [son] Willie,

1863, at Memphis.

  February 16.  Monday.--About noon with Dr. ---, Gen-

eral Barnett, and Henry Sherman left for New York to attend

the funeral. Found the doctor a thoroughly read gentleman in

war matters and in many other directions, and a most agreeable

travelling companion. Sherman, nephew of the General, is in-

telligent and agreeable. The general [Barnett] is, as always,

genial, sensible, and good.

  February 19.  Thursday.--Funeral.  Met  intimately  the

President; so full of appointment of Secretary of Treasury that









             <B>DEATH OF GENERAL SHERMAN          639</B>



no room for anything else. Agreed with him as to the appoint-

ment of Foster; met Foster at his door.  [Also] Ellis H.

Roberts, of Utica.

  Met at Sherman's Cleveland, Depew, Choate, Hawley, Man-

derson, et al. Choate had charge of me; Depew, of Cleveland.

A spontaneous outpouring of people of all sorts and deep feeling

manifested.

  Left on the train with mourners about 7 P. M. "Nearer my

God  to Thee,"  "God  be With us  Till we  Meet  Again."

[Greeted] by silent masses of men and women--the faces of

all solemn, and full of sympathy, some weeping--at Lancaster,

Harrisburg, and [other cities].

  St. Louis, February 21.  Saturday.--Father Tom Sherman

[here].  Governor Stannard invited General Schofield and his

son-in-law to dinner with me at his fine homelike home.

  February 23. Monday.--Left St. Louis with funeral party

Saturday evening. Reached Columbus at 1 P. M. yesterday.

Home today via Cleveland.

  March 3.--To Columbus. Met with the university board.

In the evening addressed finance committee of Senate in favor

of one-twentieth mill act for the Ohio State University.

  March 6. Friday.--Home with Laura.

  March 9.  Monday. -- "To know all would be to pardon all,"

is a French proverb.  I would add, "God knows all."  Spent

the day getting up my talk on Devens.  It is rather unsatis-

factory.  Laura aided me in the search for facts, and com-

ment in the Boston press and by Boston men.





                SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, March 10, 1891.

  MY  DEAR THOMAS: -- I received from you or some other

friend a "Washington letter to Philadelphia Press" on the

President's expenses. It is carefully written and seems to be

trustworthy. So far as I am concerned it is in a good spirit,

but is totally misinformed as to the result.









<B>640          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  The truth is, that having been adopted by my Uncle Birchard

when quite young, as he had been adopted by my father when

left an orphan as I was, I never was under the necessity to

study economy. He required me at school to keep an account

of my expenses, and occasionally examined it. But he never,

that I recall, found fault with me on the score of extravagance.

I never received in any office more than I expended. Rarely

as much. Possibly in the city solicitor's office of Cincinnati I

received as much as I spent, and about as much in the Presi-

dency. As governor and as Member of Congress, and in the

army, I always spent more than I received. My habits were

not expensive, and my family never lacked carefulness, but we

had enough to warrant it and we lived freely, travelled always

a good deal, and did not pinch ourselves in any respect.

  As to the Presidency, this was the situation: We were op-

posed to the use of wines and liquors in our household. We

continued at Washington the habits of our Ohio home. A

bright and persistent correspondent, who failed to get the office

he wanted, attacked us savagely on all occasions. He started

many ill-natured stories showing that we were too economical,

and repeatedly charged that the total abstinence rule at the

White House was due to a desire to save expenses. We did

nothing that even seemed to warrant this attack. We spent in

hospitality, charities, and generous living the whole amount. My

belief is, that no others ever spent as much in the White House

as we did. Many old congressmen (Mr. Stevens, Fernando

Wood, and, I think, S. S. Cox) said repeatedly that they had

known and heard of no one who entertained as much. Mrs.

Hayes took pains always to have young ladies as guests from

all parts of the country, South as well as North. Special enter-

tainments were frequent. And the regular routine of affairs

was made exceptionally brilliant and expensive. Many new

dinners and entertainments were added to the "of course" af-

fairs. Mrs. Hayes was busy with her whole-hearted energy in

looking up the needy.

  When we left Washington a story was started that I had

saved about twenty thousand dollars during my term. This

was shown by the reduction of my indebtedness to that amount.









             <B>EXPENSES AT WHITE HOUSE          641</B>



This had an appearance of truth, and was perhaps derived

from one of the family. But on looking up affairs at home it

turned out that a large part of this reduction of my debts was

from collections on real estate sales made before I left home.

I left Washington with less than one thousand dollars.

  If you find who the correspondent is, and that he is a fair-

minded man, as I think he is, you may, if it seems sensible

to do so, talk this matter up with him. But do not publish this

letter, which is for your information. The thing is not im-

portant now.  I am not blamed by any person on the score of

economy so far as I know.

                          Sincerely,

                                   RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE THOMAS DONALDSON,

    Philadelphia.



  March 22.  Sunday. -- Last evening at 7 P. M. returned with

Rutherford from the Boston trip.  Cousin Charlotte Birchard

DeWitt came with us.  Found all well at home.

  Our Boston visit, trip, the Devens memorial, and all were

most gratifying in all respects.  .  .  .  [We] reached Boston

Wednesday afternoon.  [Were] met by General Carse, Colonel

Rand, Colonel Livermore, Colonel Pope, General Fairchild.

Taken to the Vendome. Cordial welcome by these friends and

all very agreeable. Evening dined at the Algonquin Club by

Colonel Rand.  Present, Colonel Rand, General Carse, General

Martin, Mr. W. D. Howells, Colonel Pope, General Fairchild,

R. P. Hayes.

  [On the] 19th, Thursday, Webb, Mr. Cutler, General Schurz

and son Carl came. Dined, or lunched rather, with Howells,

Elinor, John, Mildred, and John G. Mitchell, Jr. Mr. Beard,

Senator Hoar, and many others called. Drove with General

Carse and Colonel Rand. In the evening the Music Hall was

crowded with distinguished people: governors, judges, lawyers,

et al. Decorations and proceedings fitting. Rev. Dr. [Phillips]

Brooks prays at a rushing pace--a  real "spurt"--but  the

language and matter are both choice.      My  piece was well

enough--better than I anticipated.

   41









<B>642          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  After, visited the Thursday Evening Club.  Abbott Lawrence,

Charles Francis Adams, Jr., Mr. Atkinson, etc., etc. Also the

Algonquin. A dinner with Carse, Rand, Schurz, Nicholson, etc.,

etc. Chancellorsville well fought over; like our Shiloh.

  March  20  [Friday], with  Carse visited the  post-office--a

capital institution. General Carse ought to be Postmaster-Gen-

eral. I predicted it to him--two years hence.

  March 23.  Monday. -- [On the] 20th [of] March at Boston,

with General Carse and Colonel Rand, called on Governor Rus-

sell. A young, cheery, hopeful, gentlemanly man--said to be

of sound and level head--with a future. How strange. The

ancient commonwealth, the home of conservative opinion and

conduct, with its boy governor! But I liked him -- predicted

good things. I have hopes for him. God bless him! How

my heart goes out to promising clean young fellows!

  Tried hot lemonade with a little whiskey to throw off a cold.

It probably does help.

  Mrs. Albritton, Bristol, Thraves, Dewitt aid Fanny with her

lace curtains for dining-room.

  March 24. Tuesday.--I hear of the death of General J. C.

Lee, of Toledo. He was one of the acquaintances with whom

I had much interesting intercourse, without great intimacy. We

ran together twice, I for governor and he for lieutenant-gover-

nor. He was a strong and able speaker -- too diffuse, too

"long-winded," but often eloquent, forcible, and effective. He

is about sixty-three years of age--yes, sixty-three in January.

We have been interested together in the Historical and Monu-

mental Association of the Maumee Valley. He was the life

and soul of the body. As secretary he did its whole work. Will

it survive him? -- Doubtful.

  March  25. -- A  letter from Newton M.  Anderson, of the

Cleveland University School, invites me to speak on the 13th

[of] April, at the opening -- Monday evening. The school is

unique. Taking boys at ten, keeping them eight years, it tries

to develop and train the whole man -- body, mind, moral nature;

habits, manners, temper;--to make  healthy, brave, graceful,

industrious as well as learned and intellectual men--skilled in









             <B>MODEL EDUCATION FOR BOYS          643</B>



manly games and exercises, skilled in manual labor, fit for the

places they are to fill in life.

  Our American society is changing, studying, thinking. The

man of the future is not [to] be an owner of privileges above

his fellows by inheritance of rank, or property, or special priv-

ileges. He may not be. The man of the future is to stand where

his gifts, his powers, his merits place him.  Let him be so

trained that he can and will prefer to stand alone.

  March 27. Friday. -- [Weather] too bad to attend funeral of

General Lee.  Wrote a few thoughts for the University School

opening at Cleveland.  Theme, a well-rounded  education, or

education that fits the young for life and its duties.





                                  SPIEGEL, March 28, 1891.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:--Your letter of the 23d is before me.  I

am still hoping for Mrs. Smith's recovery.  How  lasting some

wounds are!  I can't put aside some dates.  Twenty-one months

ago today we bore away my precious wife to her long home.

My eyes grow dim as the date is read at the top of this page.

But she was -- she is precious.

  God bless you!

                       Ever sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S.--My love to Mrs. Smith and do get rid of too much

business -- not of ALL. -- H.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.





  March 31. Tuesday. -- To Columbus about 11 A. M. Met

Captain Cope at his office, also Mr. Wing. It was arranged

that I should meet them at 7:30 P. M. to go before the House

committee on the division of the fund for agricultural and me-

chanical colleges recently adopted.  Wilberforce, an institution

of the African Methodist Episcopal Church for colored students,

claims half the fund.  [At] 7:30 P. M. met President Mitchell,









<B>644          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



a three-fourths white man, Maxwell, ditto, before the committee.

Captain Cope made a good speech. I spoke about as usual.





                                  COLUMBUS, April 1, 1891.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Whatever the event of the present affair

and it ought not to be in favor of your claim--I feel satisfied

that Ohio can and ought to aid you to equip and support an in-

dustrial department  at Wilberforce.     I will gladly  cooperate

with you in this.  It will yield more than your equitable share

of the Morrill Act.  Please think of this seriously.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  PRESIDENT MITCHELL.

                                  FREMONT, April --, 1891.

  MY DEAR COLONEL: -- It is very gratifying to be assured that

the Companions of Massachusetts are satisfied with the part in

the ceremonies in memory of General Devens that fell to me.

The affair as planned and carried out by your commandery was

so admirable that failure by others would have been a specially

regrettable circumstance.  May I not venture to congratulate

you on your personal share in the success of the occasion? Your

skilful guiding hand was surely everywhere, but so adroitly

hidden that the affair seemed to have grown to perfection by its

own sweet will. With all brotherly regard to General Carse and

all Companions.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  COLONEL A. A. RAND,

    Boston.



  April 4. Saturday.--President Scott, of Ohio State Uni-

versity, the lecturer S. P. Leland, of Chicago, and Rev. Mr.

Albritton dined with us. President Scott prefers to leave the

presidency of the university; but if he is to remain wants it

settled soon. We are now at the forks of the road. We are









             <B>PROGRESS OF STATE UNIVERSITY          645</B>



likely to have a good endowment under the one-twentieth mill

act and ought to mature a system of instruction and a general

policy for the future. We agree entirely about this. I advise

a meeting of the board as soon as the Legislature has acted on

all measures -- on appropriations, etc., etc. At this meeting we

ought to settle the question of the presidency for some years

to come. If it is deemed best to insist on President Scott, we

should relieve him from other duties. Dr. Orton is my choice.

But there seems no prospect of getting him to accept.

  April 5. Sunday.--Talked over the presidency for the Ohio

State University with President Scott.  We agree that Gladden,

Orton, and Tuttle are the preferred names. Can we get them?

Or any of them?

  April 7. Tuesday. -- Our G. A. R. memorial meeting at To-

ledo--twenty-fifth anniversary--last evening was very suc-

cessful. I spoke my "piece" with unction. The reporter says

"delivered splendidly."

  April 10. Friday. -- Dr. Curry is earnest and active as to the

work of the Slater Board.      He speaks of a meeting in New

York, May 18. I will be disposed to support him throughout.

He is able, wise, zealous.

  My next speech is for the G. A. R. State Encampment. I

must patch carefully together the best things I have said on the

war--the ideas of the war, the comradeship, the results, espe-

cially peace.

  April 11. Saturday.--Read "Cymbeline"--the Hayes ("Haie")

incident in the lane when the Britons turned on the Romans and

restored their fortunes.

  April 13.  Monday. -- To Cleveland to speak in the evening

at the opening of the University School. The affair was in every

way gratifying. The parents of Newton M. Anderson, the

principal of the school, were present, and of course very happy

to witness the triumph and honors he has won.

  The audience was intelligent and enthusiastic. My part in

it was well received.

  April 15.  Wednesday.--Reached Fremont at 4:30 P. M.

[In Cleveland] called on General Leggett. He confirms my

recollection of the General Johnston affair in connection with

General Johnston's proposed invitation into my Cabinet, viz.,

that General Leggett found at Richmond that General Johnston's

character and conduct were patriotic and upright, but that some

associations and connections were such that it might be em-

barrassing to him and to me to offer him the place.

  The general [Leggett] has suffered seriously from a cold

taken the day of General Sherman's funeral in New York. I

found myself cold and got out of the carriage and walked per-

haps a half mile or more. I asked the Secretary of War to join

me after I had gone a few squares and he (Mr. Proctor) did

so gladly.

  April 16. Thursday. -- Emerson says: "Through the years

and the centuries, through evil agents, through toys and atoms,

a great and beneficent tendency irresistibly streams."

  What Mr. Emerson calls a "beneficent and irresistible

tendency," the simple and sincere mind will continue still to

call by the old Saxon word which signifies the Supreme, Eternal

Being, God.

  April 17. Friday. -- Planted a mountain holly about four

and a half feet high on our lot southwest of the monument --

one of a large number given me by Admiral Ammen twelve

years ago and planted in Spiegel Grove. Also a beautiful

Japanese evergreen, with a lovely golden hue -- one of a great

number of Japanese trees and shrubs sent me by our consul some

ten or twelve years ago. It is more than seven feet high.





                             SPIEGEL GROVE, April 17, 1891.

  MY DEAR SIR:--In reply to your question as to the use of

wine at public and large private dinners, I am not confident that

there is any marked decline in the practice of placing it on the

table at such banquets. But if my observation is correct, the

number of those who decline to partake of it is increasing, and









             <B>THE GROWTH OF TEMPERANCE          647</B>



the number of those who drink to intoxication, even in the

slightest degree, is less than it was a few years ago.

                           Sincerely,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  EDWARD W. BOX,

    Ladies' Home Journal.



  April 19. Sunday. -- Have read Montaigne and Dr. Curry's

"Gladstone" the past week. Am to speak in Steubenville Tues-

day week. Will patch up a soldier speech.

  In substance Montaigne says: The greatest piece of good

fortune for a man is "to be born at the right time."

  April 20.  Monday. -- Read about Macaulay; finished his es-

say on "Church and State" in which he uses up Gladstone. The

Grand Old Man, with his almost sixty years of conspicuous pub-

lic life, is nearer right now on the vital questions than ever

before. He is not a model of clearness and force in his style.

Macaulay finds him, more than fifty years ago, eloquent, stately,

grave, and religious, but lacking in definiteness, logic, and other

great qualities.

  April 21. Tuesday. -- Reading "The Light of the World"

by Edwin Arnold, and finished preparation for G. A. R. speech.

  April 22.  Wednesday. -- Clark Waggoner, an honest and in-

telligent man, an earnest worker in honest politics, with no zeal-

ous watchfulness or tact in behalf of his own promotion or

pocket, needs a place. He is now nearly seventy-one. I do what

I can.  The fates seem against him.       He  called today and

lunched with us.

  April 23.  Thursday. -- This morning finished the poem of

Christ's life on earth.  Mary  Magdalene the sinner becomes

angelic. The story seems more mythical, less real and authentic,

as told here.

  April 24.  Friday.--Received a dispatch from R. F. Grundy,

Baltimore, of the death of his father Richard Grundy. He was

formerly in charge of the lunatic asylum at Dayton, afterwards









<B>648          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



at Athens.  A very able, wise, and skilful man in his profession,

and of large general ability and culture. I sent a dispatch of

condolence and appreciation. He was one of the friends made

in public life, when I was governor of Ohio, with whom my

relations were intimate.



           SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, April 24, 1891.

  MY DEAR SIR:--If I can do anything for our old friend

Charley Cist, I will gladly do it. You express precisely my

opinion and feelings about him, and I am obliged to you for

giving me an opportunity to unite with you in his behalf. I

will immediately write to Mr. McGuffey in explicit terms rec-

ommending the course you suggest.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GEORGE HOADLY.



           SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, April 24, 1891.

  MY  DEAR SIR:--I  learn by letter from Governor Hoadly

that there is a movement to admit to the Old Men's Home of

Cincinnati my old friend, Charles E. Cist. I believe I am fully

informed of the unfortunate facts in his life. Nevertheless I

think of him as a good man. He fell under circumstances of

great temptation.  Who of us has not?  The home is an excel-

lent charity. If I were in charge of it I would prove the ex-

cellence and genuineness of its charity by extending its benefits

to Charley Cist.

  In the most explicit and decided terms I recommend his ad-

mission to the home.

                 With all regard. Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MR. ALEXANDER H. McGUFFEY,

    Cincinnati.
