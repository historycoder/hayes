             <B>CONNECTICUT, 1836-1838</B>



  TWO  years after the New England trip, young Hayes, then

in his fourteenth year, was sent to Norwalk, Ohio, to

become a pupil in the Norwalk Seminary, a Methodist school, of

which the Rev. Jonathan E. Chaplin was principal. The seminary

building, a pretentious brick structure, had burned in February,

1836, but the school was continuing in the Methodist and Baptist

Churches, while the new building was being erected. Young

Hayes spent the school year 1836-37 at Norwalk. The few

letters that remain follow.]



                                NORWALK, June 21, 1836.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I do not think I shall have to go home

because I am homesick. I like staying here better than any

other school in Ohio. The object of my letter is to have you

send me - if you can get - my shoes.  I want them very much.

I am well. Do not give my love to anybody. This letter is large

enough for me and a bad pen.

                                  RUTHERFORD B: HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

               NORWALK SEMINARY, HURON Co., OHIO,

                                    [September 20, 1836].

  DEAR UNCLE:- I arrived here Sunday.  I write to get some

money, as Mr. Chaplin says the Directors of the Seminary

have determined that a single scholar shall not be taught but one

day without the tuition being advanced. I board at the same

place I did before. I will have to pay $1.75 per week here.

Mother and Fanny were well Friday when I left home.

  You must excuse my bad writing as I cannot write any better,

                         <B>(13)</B>









<B>14           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and I have a poor pen. I am in a great hurry as I have to learn

a long lesson. Give my love to Austin.

                  Your affectionate nephew,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  S. BIRCHARD.

                           NORWALK, HURON Co., OHIO,

                                          October 13, 1836.

  DEAR MOTHER:- Today is Sunday.  I thought it would [be]

as well [to] write now as to put it off any longer. I received

your letter Wednesday. I was very glad to hear from you and

that you was getting well. I am doing very well in my studies.

Wednesday was composition day.  I wrote one about Liberty.

A week ago Wednesday was speaking day. I spoke a eulogy on

Lord Chatham. I got along tolerably well, considering. I think

that I can so that I will not be scared quite to death. I was not

scared as much as the most of the boys are the first time they

speak.

  Uncle Birchard was here Thursday evening. He was on his

return home from New York; he stopped only an half hour; he

seemed in very good health.  He gave Mr. Chaplin money to bear

my expenses. He, I think, said he saw General Harrison in New

York. He said there was more attention paid the general than

any other man that ever was in the city except Lafayette. They

expected to see a childish old man, but they thought different

very soon, for there are few men that can make a better offhand

speech than General Harrison.

  The weather is cold. It snowed here Monday near two inches

deep; it snowed this morning one inch deep; it is all gone now.

The sun is very warm. Election took place the 11th. This

county give the Whigs five hundred majority; they hear from

half the counties General Vance (he is a Whig) [candidate for

Governor] is six thousand ahead so far. Geauga County gave

eighteen hundred majority to Vance. Delaware County gave

three hundred. Write soon. Tell who is elected to the offices of

the county. Ask Mr. Wasson about it. Mrs. Briggs [the woman









             <B>IN SCHOOL, MIDDLETOWN, 1837          15</B>



with whom he boarded] sends her love to you. Eliza does too.

Give my love to all who need it. I will write to Fanny soon.

                    Your affectionate son,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.





  [In the autumn of 1837 Hayes was sent to Middletown, Con-

necticut, to the private school of Isaac Webb. Mr. Webb was a

graduate of Yale College; had been a tutor in the college, and

was highly commended by President Jeremiah Day. It was a

family school, the number of pupils being restricted to twenty,

and great care being exercised to receive only boys of diligence

and good character. Mr. Webb intended that the reputation of

the school should "rest on thorough study, faithful instruction,

and steady discipline.  Habits, principles, feelings, and tastes

were to be assiduously cultivated; truth, justice, honor, and

religion to be regarded as the cardinal points of character." The

terms were two hundred and fifty dollars a year, covering every-

thing but incidental expenses. Two other Ohio lads, William

Lane, of Sandusky, and Converse Goddard, of Zanesville, were

also in the school and became devoted friends of Hayes. The

letters that remain show that the year in Middletown was happy

and profitable.]

                     MIDDLETOWN, CT., December 9, [1837].

  DEAR UNCLE: - In compliance with your request that I should

write to you in about a month, I have commenced a letter. I will

begin with my studies. I study Latin and Greek; am in the same

class as W. Lane. At first it was rather hard to keep up with

the class but now I can get along very well. We get up at half

past 6 o'clock, breakfast at 7, prayers, and school begins at 9;

dinner at 12; begins at I till 4, then from 6 till 9. I like this

school very much indeed. I never heard of a school that I should

like near so well. All the scholars like the school very much and

that is more than can be said of most schools. We all like Mr.

W [Webb] very much. I think he is the best calculated to take









<B>16           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



care of a parcel of boys of any man I 'most ever saw, for they

soon find out that he is not to be trifled with, and at the same

time that he is very pleasant when they suit him.

  It is rather curious how always it happens always that when

I have staid out of school six months that I enter in the same

class with others who have been to school all the time. When

A. Picket went to Norwalk he was in the same class with me.

As there was no class that he could go into, he had to go in a

class below him and in six months he had not got much farther

than he was when he left me, so that I went in the same class.

It was nearly the same way here. Although I have to study

rather harder, I'd rather study when I do study and play the

more.

  As you know, I have an aversion to the Yankees. I hate to

find one that there a'n't some fault peculiar to them where I

cannot have an excuse for. I had begun to hunt up some ex-

cuse for Mr. W-, when I found that he was a real Buckeye in

every sense of the word, and thinks as much of the Queen of the

West as I do--and that [is] not a few.  The folks here cele-

brated the Whig victory here as usual. Half of the subscription

went for powder and fireworks, the other half to the poor -a

first-rate way to electioneer, I take it.

   The time flies very fast indeed. I never knew a month to pass

 quicker or happier at school any how. I am well prepared for

 winter. I've only had to buy one book. W. Lane sends his

 respects. He's well, so am I. Give my respects to all my cousins

 and all the belles. Tell J. Pease [John R. Pease, a cousin, living

 in Lower Sandusky, who was an ardent Democrat] not to go

 crazy on the New York election for accidents will happen to the

 best of folks. - Mr. W-  is a Whig.

                   Your affectionate nephew,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

   S. BIRCHARD.

                         MIDDLETOWN, CON., Jan. 6, [1838].

   DEAR MANLY:--I received your letter about a month ago,

 and was very glad to receive it. The time flies the fastest here

 of any place I ever was in, and you know that it would be very









             <B>IN SCHOOL, MIDDLETOWN, 1838          17</B>



different if I was not happy. I think you must have had lots of

fun election times. It seems rather hard that I can never be at

home election day I have not been there for four years election

day and then I did not know enough about matters and things to

see anything strange in it. We have had lots of fun here too.

The celebration of the New York victory in this city was splen-

did. There was nearly a constant roar of cannon throughout

the day and in the evening three hundred dollars' worth of fire-

works [was] sent off, and from the great number of fireballs

flying in the air we could read anywhere within two miles.

  Thanksgiving was the 3oth of November. I suppose you

have heard of the richness of the dinner in this Yankee country

on that day; but it beat everything all hollow that I ever saw.

Our dessert alone, I should think, would cost fifty dollars. This

place is remarkable for its confectionery and we had things

[I] never dreamed of there being such.

  The Nanjacks must have thought they were doing it election

night to be parading the streets. I should think Allen must have

felt rather cheap when he found he wasn't elected. The Whigs

acted rather foolish to make so much fuss about the victory they

knew they would gain. H. Williams must have been half

drunk to have tried to get the balls from a parcel of boys.

  Mr. Webb for our amusement read an account (just now) of

a lawsuit in Massachusetts between a couple of sailors where

it was decided (after two years' lawing) that each party should

pay his own costs, about twelve hundred and fifty dollars apiece.

It [the lawsuit] was about eighty-two cents' worth of slabs!

  I should like to have seen that fight of your letter. Shinn ought

to stop fighting. Who do you mean by Rosem? Old Goodrich?

There has been no slaying [sleighing] of any account here, but

there's been skating pretty much ever since the 16th of Novem-

ber. For about a week there has been very warm pleasant

weather, so warm the ice has got out of the river and we saw

a steamboat go down the river yesterday, the 5th of January.

The river here is half a mile wide. Just before it shut up it

was covered with vessels of every kind all the time.

  Tell me how A. Picket flourishes with the gals. Tell him

I flourish like a green bay-tree. Tell that very dear friend of

   2









<B>18           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



mine (whoever he is) that's so particular about how I give him

my love, to write to me how he wants me to give it to him and

I'll try and accommodate him, and if he won't do that, tell him

to go to Canada with his sheepskin fiddle and fight the British

for a living!!!

  Manly, if you study hard as long as you tell me about, you

beat me all hollow for I study only nine hours and I learn the

fastest I ever did in my life. Give my love to Mr. Wasson's

family. Tell D. Selvaene you want [to] know how his name

is spelt for I shall want to write it some of these oddsome-

shorts [sic!].

  Now I am a-going to run on a certain passage in your letter.

You said that you was very respectfully mine. Well now, I have

strong reasons to doubt your being mine; for if you was, I'd

set you to work to earn money for me to spend. My opinion

is that you belong to Mr.  C. Covell of Delaware, Delaware

County, Ohio.

  This is a pleasant town. There are about eight thousand in-

habitants. It is a real Van Buren hole; nearly every man is

one. Mr. Webb is a real Whig. You may tell our folks that I

shall write to them soon. Don't show them any more of my

letters.

  I remain your dear, loving, kind, everlasting, hurrah-boys

friend,                                           R. B. HAYES.



  P. S.-- This letter has nothing in it for the best of reasons.

I've nothing to write.  (Write soon.)

  To M. D. COVELL,

    From R. B. HAYES.

                        MIDDLETOWN, CON., Feb. 24, [1838].

  DEAR HARRIET:--I have forgotten whether I promised to

write to you or Sarah or to either of you, but it's no great odds.

I am a-going to write to you as you'll begin to suspect by this

time. What to write is the next thing to look "arter"!

  When I was in Vermont I staid two days at Uncle Elliot's

and had fun for divers reasons; first, case I liked his new wife

real first-rate; second, case Belinda and the rest of the gals were









             <B>IN SCHOOL, MIDDLETOWN, 1838          19</B>



home; third, case the male cousins were gone from home; fourth,

case as how they had shells and W. I. [West Indian] plants that

I never before had seen. Lastly because there was a little cousin

there about three years old, funny too as Elek was!!! I forget

whether it was a boy or girl, but I believe it was a girl. No great

odds, though. Uncle Russell has got a real good wife. I move

he has good luck getting married. There has been very "few"

snow this winter. I 've had one sleigh-ride, but give me a

Buckeye ride in mud two feet deep [rather] than a Yankee one

in snow the same depth. There are divers things in this blue

country that I like better than Ohio; for example, Thanksgiving

dinner, or even a fast, for we had one the 22d; and if that is a

Yankee fast I move I should like to see a feast!!

  The French tutor is a passionate old fellow. He looks more

like a plump feather bed than anything else I know of!! Here he

is.  [Sketch.]

  We have to go to meeting twice every Sunday. The priest [a

common New England designation for minister at that time]

prays thirty minutes; everything else in proportion.      He's a

harder case than Mr. V --  for length and not near so interesting.

I ha'n't no more to write. Give love to all the folks in the house,

Sal, Bet, Mary, and all.  Write right, right off!!!  Don't excuse

nothinnnnum.

                       Your first-class friend,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  To MIss H. MOODY,

      Delaware, Ohio.

  I got [a] strong s'picion this letter a'n't worth postage.

[The postage on it was twenty-five cents!]



                         MIDDLETOWN, CONN., April 5, 1838.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I received your letter of the 18th of March

about two weeks since. I have nothing particular to write. I

like the school [as] well as ever. Time passes very pleasantly.

There are very fine places to walk here. About five miles from

here the scenery is beautiful. Saturday afternoons, when it is

pleasant, we walk out to a mountain eight miles off where we









<B>20           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



can see Hartford, New Haven, Saybrook, and ten or eleven

small villages. It is a long walk, or rather run for we trot

most of the way, but it pays well for the trouble.

  My clothes do very well. I shall not want any more money

this term as I know of.  I gave what you sent to Mr. Webb.

I room with William Lane. We are real good chums. I do

not study French because I have as much as I can do without.

I think I shall study it next term. The Frenchman is a mean

old chap. He gets mad and goes off from table very often.

He'll not stay here next term.

  I was reading the acts of the last legislature and I saw a bill

for McAdamising [macadamizing] Black Swamp. I hope now

you will have a good road there. Friday evenings Mr. Webb

reads us the speeches of the great men in Congress, so I know

more what is doing than I do at home. Mr. Webb being a

Whig was elected First Alderman of this city.  Election took

place three or four days ago. There was n[o] school.

  Give my love to all the cousins.  Tell Mr. Pease that if the

New York election last fall did not make him feel queer, I don't

know what will unless it's the Connecticut election. Though I

suppose he's heard it before this, it will do him good to keep

him in mind of it. The Whigs have carried the State by five

thousand seven hundred majority. There is but one Van Buren

[man] out of twenty-one in the Senate. This is eight thousand

Whig gain!!

                      Your affectionate nephew,

                                        from R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- W. G. Lane sends his compliments, etc.

  To S. BIRCHARD,

      Lower Sandusky, Ohio.



         MAPLE GROVE, MIDDLETOWN, CONN., April 28, 1838.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I received your letter on the 18th.  It looked

as if it had received sundry hard knocks. I will start for Ver-

mont day after tomorrow morning unless something extra hap-

pens. I shall try to act so that my visit will be agreeable to my

relations and pleasant to myself. Mr. Webb has, I believe,









             <B>IN SCHOOL, MIDDLETOWN, 1837          21</B>



written to you lately, and as he knows best about my progress in

my studies, I refer you to his letter.

  I shall study France next term. We speak French at table

altogether. I shall be fitted for college by next fall, but Mr.

Webb says I am too young to enter next fall. I don't believe it,

though. I had rather go to college at the West, of course.

  W. Lane is a real splendiferous chap. He is a very odd chap.

He will make, if nothing happens, a very smart man --as smart

as his father, and that will do, I reckon.

  As I have a sore hand, a bad pen, and nothing to write about,

I'll stop. -- Your affectionate nephew,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Give my love to all the cousins.

  MR. SARDIS BIRCHARD,

      Lower Sandusky, Ohio.



  [Mr. Webb  wrote Mr.  Birchard, April 30, 1838, in these

words: "Your nephew, R. B. Hayes, has now closed a profitable

term to himself, I think, and am happy to say, satisfactory to

myself.  .  . . . Rutherford has applied himself industriously

to his studies and has maintained a consistent and correct de-

portment. I think he will avail himself of the advantages of an

education and fully meet the just anticipations of his friends.

He is well informed, has good sense, and is respected and es-

teemed by his companions. He is strictly economical and regular

in his habits, and has established a very favorable character

among us.

  "Rutherford is too young to enter college. Another year of

preparation would be a vast advantage in his education, and the

expense, I am sure, would be richly rewarded. Were he my son,

I would by all means give him another year to be prepared in.

I shall be glad to know your views in the matter. Judge Lane's

son has made up his mind upon his own judgment, that he is too

young to enter college next fall, and purposes remaining another

year. I am exceeding desirous for Rutherford's sake that he

should remain with Wm. Lane. I shall hope for a communica-

tion from you in relation to the matter."]

                           MIDDLETOWN, CT., June 6, 1838.

  DEAR UNCLE:--I have been here now four or five days and

am very glad to get back; not but that I spent vacation very

pleasantly, but it seems like home here more than anywhere else,

though I make myself at home anywhere in five minutes.

  I went to see all my relations in Vermont. They are all well.

The more I see of Uncle Austin the better I like him. Aunt

looks older and takes more care of home and less of the store

than she used to do. Mary is very handsome. She wants to go

to Ohio very much.      Uncle Noyes'  folks tried to make  an

Abolitionist of me, but that would not work. They all thought

Mr. Webb's would be a good place for George, but when I told

them there was not an Abolitionist in school, oh! horrible!

Then they'd as soon send him to a lion's den!!

  You said in your letter to Uncle Austin that Mr. Webb had

written to you about my  staying here another year.  If [I]

thought it would be a great advantage to me I had rather stay,

but I don't think it would; for persons who have been through

college say that when a person enters college so that he can get

on the first year very easy, after that [he] don't get along so

well as those who have to work hard when they first enter.

  If I don't enter college till a year, I'll have to stay a year

longer in college and that year spent in studying human nature

would be more profitably [spent] than studying dead languages.

Things being so, I had rather not stay another year.

  I received one hundred and fifty dollars from Uncle Austin

the 28th of May of which I paid to Mr. Webb one hundred and

forty-three dollars the Ist of June; the rest were travelling ex-

penses.

  If you think it best that I should stay a year longer, I am

perfectly willing to do it without going home.

  Grandmother said she in her will had [given] Fanny and I

each fifty dollars.

  Give my love to all the relations.

                 Your affectionate nephew,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  Please write soon.

  MR. S. BIRCHARD.









             <B>IN SCHOOL, MIDDLETOWN, 1838          23</B>



                          MIDDLETOWN, CONN., July 7, 1838.

  DEAR MOTHER:- I received your letter a short time since

and by it I see that if you do not hear from me often [you are

worried about me. With me it] is just the opposite. When

I haven't heard from you for some time I know you are well

or you'd write to me.    Every letter I get I am almost afraid

to open it for fear of bad news.     If I am sick you shall hear

from me very often. I shall try to be careful of my health.

  I hope that J. Rigsur may  yet recover his health.      He has

always been an excellent friend of mine.      I know nothing of

cures, but I should think if he were thrown into cold water it

might cure him.

  I think it is not best to stay another year.  If I can enter col-

lege this year, I can go through very well I am certain.  And

unless it is harder to enter than the college here, I can enter.  I

have went through five books of Virgil more than is required

and shall review all the studies again.    This term I've begun

French and I get ahead very well. The time flies as it did last

term and that's saying considerable.  Converse tells me more

about your doings at Putnam than you did!

  They had a grand celebration here on the Fourth. The Gov-

ernor and the best troops in this State and New York City were

here.  The common soldiers were dressed better than the gen-

eral officers out our way.  We have just as many cherries and

strawberries out of Mr. Webb's garden as we can eat, and have

had these three weeks.  [One line cut out.]

  It is laughable to see the difference between the beginning

and end of your letter.    I should think by the first part that

all the folks were dead, by the latter that they were getting

married. I am glad that F. [Fanny] is going to Norwalk. I

hope it will be good hunting when I get home for if nothing

happens I will hunt considerable.  Don't be afraid of writing

too long letters. Tell M. Covell I've received his letter. Is W.

L. Webb at home?       I don't know of anything more to write

about.  Give my love to the relations that are in Delaware and

Mr. Wasson's family in particular.  I intend to send a little

paper to Jenny today. Tell F. to write too.

                 From your affectionate son.









<B>24           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  P. S. --I forgot to tell you that four of us were invited to

dinner by one of the boys who lives fifteen miles from here.

We walked over there; staid ten hours and walked back by

bed  time--thirty-six miles  in six hours.  Three of  us were

Buckeyes, the other was an Alabamian. Quite pedestrians, the

Buckeyes!                               RUTHERFORD  B. HAYES.



  Here is my  crest.  It is the implements of haying to show  I

am a farmer and hay, in the plural Hayes. [The "crest" is a

rude pen drawing showing within a circle a scythe, a rake, and

a pitch-fork crossed, and a haycock in the background, with

"R. B. H., Buckeye" underneath.]

  DEAR MOTHER:--Converse Goddard received a letter from

home asking him to come home next vacation and wishes my

company as you'll see by the following:

                    MIDDLETOWN, THURSDAY EVE'G, August 30, 1838.

  MADAM:--I take the liberty of addressing you from the long friend-

ship I entertain for your son. My object at present is to inform you

that, as I intend returning to Ohio the next vacation, I would be very happy

of the company of your son, at the same time assuring you that I would

keep him out of danger and all dissipation. I hope you will not fail to

permit him to return, knowing as you do that it would conduce very much

to his happiness.--Respects to Miss Hayes.

                                  Your ob't servant,

                                                D. C. GODDARD.



  I have not as yet received an answer to my letter of July 30,

but expect to receive one soon.     D. Con. Goddard's letter was

written in case that I should go to Yale College, as in that case

I told him I supposed I'd not return this fall. Now, I, as a

matter of course, should like very well to come home; but do

not (if you have determined that I shall not come) change your

mind for anything I say.  If I do come, I wish to come with

D. C. Goddard, as I like him and W. Lane a little "taller" than

anybody else in Connecticut. He will go by the way of New

York and Philadelphia, as it is from here altogether the quickest

route. He says it cost him twenty-seven dollars to go there, and

back he thinks it'll cost about sixty dollars.

  Tell me if I shall bring my books, if I come. I better not

unless I go to Kenyon.   I have written this more on Con's ac-

count than mine. Enough of this. I am now studying French,

arithmetic, etc.

  Con went to a wedding yesterday about twelve miles from

here, -- Mr. Hawes of Zanesville and Miss Hale of Glaston-

bury. W. Lane and myself talk werry "loud" of (if we go

to Yale) walking to Ohio some vacation!

  (R. wants to go home very much but thinks you do not wish

him to.                         Very respectfully, GODDARD.)

  That is a mistake.

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. SOPHIA HAYES.



                      MIDDLETOWN, CONN., Sept. 18, [1838].

  I received your letter dated September 9 this evening. As a

matter of course, we begin to think considerable of vacation.

We will scatter on the 28th of this month. Converse Goddard,

son of General Goddard of Zanesville, Ohio, is a-going home by

the way of Philadelphia, and as we are great chums it would

be very pleasant to go in company. We had it all planned out

how we would travel when I received Mother's letter telling me

that Mr. Powers would send me money four or five days before

vacation and I should return with him, as he would be ready to

start from New York by the 2d or 3d of October; and if I find

that I'll have to wait four days, I'll call on Mr. Powers and tell

him, and go right on with C. Goddard. He wishes to stay a day

in New York and in that time we will be able to see the most

of the city.

  Although you have not asked my notions "about war," I'll let

you have some of them. I should have written more as if I

wished to go to Yale, had it not been that I was afraid Mother

and Sister would think that I did not wish to see them, and that

I thought more of the Yankees than of them.

  The next term of Kenyon College will begin in about four

weeks after I get home; and in a fortnight after I get home I

would like to get a little wagon and take a few books over

and be examined, come home, go and see you, then back to

college (provided I could enter), stay through freshman year,

and, if I wished, I could then go and enter Yale freshman with

W. G. Lane and D. C. Goddard, if they conclude to go to Yale.

But I won't "count the chickens before they are hatched." I

should like "bad" to learn to ride and hunt considerable in

vacation. I've grown "werry tall" since I've been here. Mr.

Webb not having yet come in and he'll have to tell me about what

is now due; so I'll stop for now.

  Mr. Webb says my bill is not yet made out but that I can

carry it home, and then will be soon enough to pay it. I think

there will be ten or twelve dollars due. Do not write to Mother

as though I would be home so soon, but if I go with Converse

Goddard I'll be home by the 4th of October which is my birthday.

  I remain your affectionate nephew,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  Give my love to all my cousins and all others whom it may

concern. W. G. Lane and D. C. Goddard send their best re-

spects; being with myself the only Buckeyes here, we form quite

a friendly trio.
