 FEBRUARY 21.  Wednesday.--I have just read President

     Hinsdale's account of Garfield as a student and teacher.

Here was his strength. In both capacities he was a model. He

had large faculties, memory, analysis, fluency, the debating fac-

ulty.  He was the best popular debater of his time.  He was not

executive in his talents, not original, not firm,--not a moral

force.  He leaned on others -- could not face a frowning world;

his habits suffered from Washington life. His course at various

times when trouble came betrayed weakness. The Credit Mobilier

affair, the De Golyer business, his letter of acceptance, and many

times his vacillation when leading the House, place him in an-

other list from Lincoln, Clay, Sumner, and the other heroes of

our civil history.



         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, February 23, 1883.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I was lucky in letters yesterday. Not a

single bore, viz., a letter in which I take no interest, but to

which I must reply, and several good ones, capped by yours.

  Mrs. Hayes' ill health was merely rheumatism.  It left her in

excellent health and spirits.

  The hope of your coming to Toledo will keep me in "such

spirits." I do not know Bottelle, but if his success is in your

way, down with him.

  The Pond book is good. Your article is splendid.

             <B>PLANS FOR A NEW CHURCH          111</B>



  This writing is to say again, bring Mrs. Comly here and leave

her among the Christians of our grove while you go over to

meet the wild beasts at Ephesus.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL J. M. COMLY.



  [March] 18. -- Fanny came home last night with Webb.  She

is looking well and is full of animation. All of the family are

together at home this morning. The Methodist Episcopal breth-

ren decided to make an effort to build a new church at the offi-

cial meeting last week.     I proposed three ideas which were

adopted.

  1. Church not to cost exceeding fifteen thousand dollars com-

plete.

  2.  No  obligations to be  incurred until four-fifths of the

estimated cost has been secured in reliable subscriptions.

  3. A committee on collections to proceed with a canvass for

subscriptions as soon as plans are adopted.

  4. A committee on plans; plan to be adopted by official board

before a canvass for subscriptions is made.

  I shall add, "No debts more than three thousand dollars in

the aggregate."



                             SPIEGEL GROVE, March 22, 1883.

  MY DEAR S--: -- I am more than glad to get your talk about

the battle.<B>*</B> Your description is in penmanship and English

clean-cut. The fight was notable. I would listen eagerly to

full details. Perhaps when I come to New York next month --

about the twenty-fifth -- you can find time to waste an hour or

two on me in telling it.  Such battles as you fought are the mod-

ern substitute for the combats of the crusaders, and of the gun-

powder fights of later times as well. Gould, Garrett, Vanderbilt

and such are our giants and warriors. They dwarf the gladiators

of the press, the pulpit, and the forum. You had a great triumph.

which the latter, under the generalship of Mr. Smith, was victorious.</FONT>

Of course nothing is ever final. "He shall keep who can." But

the past is secure and we rejoice with you.

  By the by, what a growth you are making.  I wonder if you

are conscious of it. That short article of yours on Randolph,

the "Krank," I read to Mrs. Hayes.  She has an instinctive

judgment of such things that is almost unerring. She said:

"How good that is! It is better than he has done before--

better than anybody else." There is something in it.

  If H-  and H-  write to you, you will try to do their work,

I hope.  You needn't look to me.  I write with a stiff pen.  I

can move only by jumps. The gift, or the acquired faculty, of

a flow I never had. Too much self-knowledge stands in the

way  of effort--of improvement--and the misfortune is, it

does stand.

  Comly's case is a hard one. I saw him in bed where he had

been lying a month--hopeful and cheery, bright and witty

--but!!

  Don't work too hard. Take warning by our friend. Remem-

ber us when you have time. We always have time to think of

you and yours.

  With all good wishes to you all, sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

    New York.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 23, 1883.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Your note inviting me to address the comrades

and citizens next Decoration Day at Piqua is before me. I

appreciate this renewed invitation, and would be glad to accept

if the situation would permit.  May I do this?  Let a speaker

be secured for the occasion, who will in any event make the

principal address. I will be present and make an offhand talk

after the formal address. If I go anywhere on that day away

from Fremont, I will be at Piqua. I will write you next month

or early in May more definitely. Let there be no announcement

of my coming until after you hear from me again.

                          Sincerely,

  [Unidentified.]                               R. B. HAYES.

Private.

            SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, March 24, 1883.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--My thanks for your prompt and hearty

denial of the uncalled for charges of the News..  I cannot see

the excuse or the explanation for its assault. As you say, I am

in private life--and with no wish to leave it. As to the sug-

gestion that I may be nominated for next governor, it is enough

to say that on all suitable occasions (there is no reason to rush

into print) I inform everyone that I would not under any cir-

cumstances accept the nomination if it were offered to me.

  You will perhaps be interested in hearing what I suppose to

be the explanation of this charge of parsimony. All who know

me understand how foreign it is from the truth. When wine

was excluded from the White House, there was a buzz both in

society and among the talkers in public resorts. A disappointed

office-seeker, who erroneously supposed he had failed by reason

of his convivial habits (the fact being that the place he wanted

was well filled already), saw his opportunity and explained the

reform at the White House as a measure of economy--due to

parsimony. Hence a host of falsehoods in that line. But too

much of this.

  We are all in usual health, and were never more contented or

happier than now.

  I hope Mrs. Bickham and your flock are in like condition.

Mrs. Hayes joins me in all good wishes to Mrs. Bickham and

yourself.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Please regard this all as between ourselves. As in

fact I care very little for abuse, I do not want even to seem

otherwise by noticing it. -- H.

  MAJOR W. D. BICKHAM,

    Dayton.



  March 27.  Thursday. -- Last night a meeting of the trustees

and official board of our Methodist Episcopal church met with

   8









<B>114          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Dr. Mather in the basement of the church to discuss plans for

the proposed building. The Lima plan--the plan of the Pres-

byterian church at Lima--was generally satisfactory.  Mr. June

came in during the evening and objected to it because it had no

basement. This was discussed, and to some extent he yielded.

Mr. Stairwalt was requested to prepare an estimate of the

cost of the Lima plan with an improved spire. Adjourned to

meet Monday night, two weeks hence. It was resolved to make

subscriptions binding on procuring nine thousand dollars sub-

scriptions on or before July 1.





Private.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 28, 1883.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your note of the 24th instant is before me.

I have not the least objection to stating my intention as to a re-

turn to public life, and am quite willing it should be generally

known. But I do not wish to publish nor to authorize the publi-

cation of anything on the subject.

  When I left office two years ago, it was my intention not to

return to public life. I have seen no reason to change this pur-

pose and would under no circumstances accept the nomination

referred to in the marked article you have sent to me.  This

I have said to all who have consulted me, and I think it is well

understood in the State.

  My chief interest in pending public questions is on the subject

of education in the South -- particularly for the colored people.

Whatever I can do on this subject to promote favorable action

can best be done out of politics and out of public life.

  I am gratified by the general tone of your articles on my

Administration and wish to assure you of my appreciation of

them.

                 With best wishes, sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MR. ALFRED T. WAITE,

    Boston.









             <B>ALTOGETHER OUT OF POLITICS          115</B>



  April 2. -- Fanny left this morning for her school in Cleve-

land. She is healthy and rosy, growing well. She plays beauti-

fully. Her mother's singing last night was as charming as

ever. Not artistic, I suppose, but I never heard finer. A happy

reunion.

  Friday, April 6, 1883. -- I returned from a Loyal Legion meet-

ing in Cincinnati on Wednesday. I met Colonel Corbin who

talked much of Garfield and his affairs.  Garfield [he said] never

spoke of religion. His only reference to it was when Rev. Mr.

Powers (?) was either spoken of or called. He said: "I am will-

ing to stand by the account as it is made up."

  Blaine and --- both began to trim their sails for places in

Arthur's cabinet as soon as it seemed likely that Garfield would

not live. Very soon after Garfield was shot, Blaine prepared an

able paper and read it to the Cabinet on the disability question,

showing that Arthur should assume the duties of the President,

for the time.  Two members of the Cabinet only were of this

opinion.  The paper was sent to Arthur in New York.  It was

afterwards destroyed (?).

  April 17.  Tuesday. -- We go today to Kingston, Ross County,

to the funeral of Aunt Lucy. She was a good friend of ours --

a very sensible and efficient woman.

  My reflections lead me to the idea that the practical good thing

for me to try to give the public is general education. With my

family affairs, my place, my town, and this as an object, I can

always be agreeably and usefully employed.  I am averse to writ-

ing for the public; I am out of official life; but it seems to me I

can accomplish something in this direction.

  April 21.  Saturday.--We met thirty-seven Cooks, counting

the wives and husbands of Cooks, at the funeral of Aunt Lucy.

The Boggses were about thirty.  The most of those present were

both Cooks and Boggses--about forty-five relatives in all--

mostly young people. A promising number of young people.



                                   NEW YORK, April 25, 1883.

  MY DARLING: -- I arrived on time yesterday morning at

10:30. The trip was pleasant, and the company very good. I









<B>116          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



met, of course, people interested in you specially. One, an editor

of a Rochester paper, was really disposed to gush. He went so

far as to say, chiefly on your account, that "ex-President" sounded

so much like "next President" that he couldn't but think the

latter was in truth the equivalent of the former. But it stirred

no emotions in me and will not, I am sure, in you.

  I will take an early breakfast this morning, and after it sally

out for a walk in the crisp, bright, frosty air. No doubt you

have the same frost, and I am trying to conjecture how much

mischief it has done in old Spiegel. If you inquire how it hap-

pens that I am up so early, I have only to remind you that you are

not with me. It is a just punishment for not fetching you with

me. I never come without you that I am not filled with remorse,

as Fan would say in her intense manner. I now, for the dozenth

time, resolve not to do so again.

  I took tea with Charlie Mead's family last night. Kitty has

grown tall and handsome. It is a model family. They grow

on one. I told war stories. Little Lark said to his mother:--

"How much better they are than the foolish things in that old

'Guy Mannering' that you are reading to us."

  I see no reason why I should not start home Friday, as I in-

tended, and be with you again Saturday night.

               With ever so much, affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.

                                     SPIEGEL, April 29, 1883.

  MY DEAR S--:--I was called home suddenly Friday morning

by a dispatch from Rutherford that his mother was very sick.

I was relieved by a dispatch at Rochester that she was much

better, and on reaching home found the trouble gone and Lucy

in good spirits, and entirely rid of the trouble. I have told you

of the nature of the attacks--rheumatism or neuralgia of the

stomach.

  I received the dispatch indicating your return Friday morning

and had arranged to hunt you up and have a good time with

you Friday afternoon and evening. I am no doubt indebted to

you for a very enjoyable dinner with a distinguished company at









             <B>DEVOTION TO EDUCATION          117</B>



Whitelaw Reid's. I was happier than at any New York dinner

when I was President.

  I hope Mrs. Smith is well again. -- I had counted on a sum-

ming up with you. But better luck next time. I hope to go

again June 30 or July 2.

  In haste. With all good wishes.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

    New York.





  May 5. -- At home again.  Left Cincinnati this morning about

8 A. M. Stepped on to my verandah as the clock struck 5 P. M.

via Columbus and Fostoria. Last night with Mrs. Herron went

to Music Hall to see Othello. The best night of the famous

dramatic entertainment. John McCullough as Othello, Barrett as

Iago, etc., etc. A noble spectacle -- the stage, the great audience.

  May 7. A. M. -- Scott goes this morning to Green Spring to

attend the academy in the care of Rev. R. B. Moore. We are

all interested in fitting him out for his six weeks' experiment.

He can come home to spend Sunday; is only eight miles away.

But it is away from home. His first launch in the world alone!

  This afternoon Lucy and I took Scott in the carriage with his

trunk, valise and carpet over to the academy. . . . We were

much pleased with the room. Lucy arranged Scott's little prop-

erty with her usual tact. The young gentleman seemed very

happy.  After he had kissed us good-bye and we were off he

walked away from the hotel, where we parted, towards the acad-

emy in a manly way. But his mother watching him through the

small glass in the back curtain of the carriage saw him turn and

look after us, when [we] were almost out of sight! We shall

see him soon. Dear boy.

  May 13.  Sunday. -- The death of the Union heroes to their

fathers and mothers, wives and sisters -- to all of this generation

of their blood--is a life-long sorrow; to all of the future gen-

erations a life-long pride and joy.









<B>118          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Monday, May 21, 1883. -- We  have raised our church build-

ing subscription to ten thousand dollars and upwards. The build-

ing now goes on. Birchard and Webb think our dining-room

improvement should also go on.

  Tuesday, 22. -- In the evening met with the trustees of the

Methodist Episcopal church; decided to begin building; author-

ized Mr. Stairwalt to take charge at three dollars per day for

time actually employed.

  Received  a letter from  Musgrave,  secretary  of the stage

company, as to pay for Yosemite trip.

  Wednesday, 30.  Decoration Day. -- Left Columbus on train

for Piqua about 10 A. M. At Urbana, in the rain, Mr. J. O.

Neer, assistant collector internal revenue under General Ken-

nedy, and committee of invitation for Piqua G. A. R. joined me.

Reached Piqua soon after noon. A barouche drawn by four

splendid grays with an escort of the G. A. R. and band took

me to Colonel Orr's, corner of Green and Downing Street. Met

there Colonel Orr and the orator of the day, Captain E. Morgan

Wood, et al. The cemetery ground was reached after a nice

lunch at Colonel Orr's. It is a fine site and well improved. The

view of the valley of the Miami from the high grounds west of

the hydraulic canal was beautiful. Dr. Dorsey presided. Dur-

ing the delivery of Captain Wood's oration it rained cruelly,

but the audience with outspread umbrellas kept their places and

the gallant captain under very difficult and discouraging circum-

stances acquitted himself most creditably. I spoke offhand and

well enough, with the rain appeased, as long as seemed wise.

  In the evening, Rev. Mr. Ely, Presbyterian, presided in his

church. Good singing of stirring army songs by Mrs. Barnett

and a good choir, all hands the chorus.

  The short speeches were successful in that they did not bore

the people and that of Rev. Lyman J. Fisher was very felicitous,

and Hon. R. M. Murray was taking.  On my suggestion he (a

Member of Congress) was instructed to support national aid to

education in the South.  He accepted heartily and gave the

pledge. Slept and breakfasted at Colonel Orr's.

  The drift of my talk was that Decoration Day is entitled to









             <B>DECORATION DAY AT PIQUA          119</B>



be and to remain forever one of our national holidays. Also that

Lincoln was the Commander-in-chief and fell in battle! That

Decoration Day is therefore Lincoln Day. I quoted three verses

of George Alfred Townsend's poem before the Society of the

Army of the Potomac at Washington a few days ago.







                            COLUMBUS, OHIO, June I, 1883.

  MY DARLING DAUGHTER:--We  came  from the Grove to

Laura's Tuesday. Lizzie accompanies your mother and is very

helpful.  Wednesday I went to Piqua and had a part in very

agreeable Decoration Day ceremonies, both afternoon and eve-

ning. Yesterday I returned here. Your mother seems very

happy meeting old friends and acquaintances. We shall probably

remain until Monday, and then visit Mr. and Mrs. Herron dur-

ing the most of next week in Cincinnati.

  I am made a little uneasy--not seriously, however--by the

mysterious intimation of your last letter to your mother. You must

curb your rebellious spirit. You inherit, I know, enterprise and

daring from a long line of Scotch borderers--the Scotts, the

Rutherfords, and the Hayeses. There are, I must tell you, a

basketful of reasons why a demure and subdued line of conduct

is most becoming in you. Your immediate ancestors, maternal

especially, have a place in the good opinion of good people not

to be imperilled by their children's wild oats without misgiving

and perhaps tears. Think of it, darling, and make us all happy

by your considerate and discreet conduct.

  We found the dear ones here all just as we would wish them.

More of happiness and less of the opposite in their several cups

than often falls to the lot of mortals. Three better and more

promising and admirable children than Laura's are under few

roofs. Fanny Fullerton is greatly blessed also in the same way.

  No more now from your loving father.

                                                  R. B. H.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Cleveland.

           SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, June 23, 1883.

  MY DEAR SIR:--My absence from home has prevented an

earlier acknowledgment of the invitation to attend the Brooklyn

meeting to honor the seventieth birthday of your illustrious

townsman, Rev. Henry Ward Beecher.

  I beg you to accept my thanks for the invitation. Please pre-

sent my congratulations and best wishes to Mr. Beecher, and

assure him of my very cordial sympathy with the object of the

meeting.

  Regretting that I cannot be present, I remain,

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MR. CHARLES E. WEST,

    CHAIRMAN.



  June 27.  Wednesday -- Attended meeting of Garfield Monu-

ment Board at Cleveland to fix the site of the monument.  The

Cleveland members on account of the convenient access from

the city to a low knoll near the gateway entrance had a prefer-

ence for that.  But on examination of the ridges further back, it

was decided on my motion to place it in [the] oats field on a

ridge near the southern end of the grounds.  From this point

there is a noble view of the city and suburbs, and of Lake Erie

for many miles. The monument will be like a city set upon a

hill--in sight from land and lake.  The matter was fully dis-

cussed, all the members present participating. My motion on

calling the yeas and nays was sustained as follows, viz.: Ayes;

Foster, Hayes, Payne, Perkins, Handy, Eels, Hay, Carson,

Townsend, Rhodes, Hurlbut--eleven.  Nays; Wade -- one.

  A pleasant talk with two young fellows, Herrick and Backus,

going to Chicago to be examined for Yale college.

  A long and interesting conversation with Mr. Allen, secretary

of Mayor Low, of Brooklyn. He was enthusiastic in praise of

Mr. Low and his admirable executive reforms and ability in the

city affairs. He, Mr. Low, seems to be making an excellent

officer. He is showing how to govern a city. The plan seems

to be the one-man power and the one man fit for the place.









             <B>FOURTH OF JULY AT WOODSTOCK         121</B>



  July 1.  Sunday.--Friday, Lucy  and  I went  to Oberlin.

          . . . We attended a reception to Dr. and Mrs. Warner of

New York at President Fairchild's.  Met there Governor Cox,

General Nettleton, of Minnesota, Dr. Strieby, Professor Monroe.

  In the evening Rev. Dr. Barbour, of Yale, delivered a weighty

address on the theology of Oberlin.

  Saturday morning attended the commencement of the Theo-

logical Department.  Felicitious speaking.  I made a few offhand

remarks at the close which were well received. I emphasized

Oberlin's merit as a place where education of the best sort could

be got at small cost and spoke also of the pioneer work for co-

education, equal chance for the colored youth, and brave work

against slavery.

  We start tomorrow for Woodstock, Connecticut, to spend the

Fourth at Roseland Park with Mr. Bowen.





  ROSELAND PARK, WOODSTOCK, CONNECTICUT, July 7, 1883.

  MY DARLING DAUGHTER:--Your mother and I have had one

of the to-be-remembered visits with Mr. and Mrs. Bowen, and

their large and delightful family.  Seven stalwart sons from

thirty-five to fifteen, three daughters, all grown, make up their

treasures, if we leave out half a dozen grandchildren. Polo,

swimming, and driving are the diversions.  We  saw a little

dancing last evening.

  Our important drive was twelve or fifteen miles to Putnam's

wolf den. It was a most enjoyable trip, and the historical den

is no way beneath its fame.

  Your mother's best thing was her bath with "all the boys" in

the little lake at the park. It is a region of elegant homes and

fine people. . . .  We  have perhaps never enjoyed more a

trip and visit than this. For particulars, listen to our talk after

we return. . . .

  With much love to all, affectionately,

                                                          H.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Fremont.









<B>122          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 16, 1883.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I thank you for the comments of the Eastern

press on the Woodstock [Fourth of July] speech. The question

discussed deserves attention. As a member of the board of

trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, and especially as one

of the trustees of the Slater Fund, it has been my duty to con-

sider it carefully. The trustees of the Slater Fund have reached

one conclusion which I deem of much importance, viz.: That

the schools to be encouraged should be prepared to instruct their

pupils in mechanical employments -- should teach not only what

is found in books, but the arts by which to make a living. The

failure to do this is a capital defect in our public school system.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  [Unidentified.]

                            FREMONT, OHIO, July 31, 1883.

  MY DEAR AUNTY:--We are made happy to know you are

happy at the beautiful resort.  We would come to you if we

could.  We are sorry we can't.  To come now would just suit

me, but other engagements and duties are in the way.

  You know Lucy went to Chicago, and [you] will be glad to

learn that she enjoyed the meeting thoroughly.

  I believe in Chautauqua and Dr. Vincent. It is a wise and

good work that he is doing. Success to it! He ought to be

grateful to me that I left his work well alone until I am rid of

the ill odor of political associations.

  Be happy! With the love of all at Spiegel Grove to you and

Dr. Davis and Jack Herron to boot.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  August 11.--I have attended soldiers' reunions and spoken

often with fair success. Always well received. Judge Hoadly,

the Democratic candidate for governor, goes out of his way to









             <B>HOADLY'S SPITEFUL TONGUE          123</B>



retail the slanders of my enemies. He is spiteful and untruth-

ful--a most reckless chatterbox.  The Republicans found out

long ago, what the Democrats are now learning, that Hoadly's

tongue is a heavy load for a political party to carry.  He tells

in an interview one new lie. He says I was made commander

of the Loyal Legion in Ohio by my trickery. I, in fact, had noth-

ing whatever to do with it, and did not know until the very

moment when it was done that any one would propose or had

thought of my name.

  Mrs. Herron is very sick. Blood poisoning is feared. She

is still very beautiful but suffers extremely.

  August 12.--Some  one sends me  the Nashville American

containing, August 3, another talk of Hoadly's. He is a spiteful

chatterbox and malicious gossip, who by the hour retails ex-

ploded slanders and stale lies about men who have been more

successful in public life than himself.





                         FREMONT, OHIO, September 7, 1883.

  DEAR SIR:--I am in receipt of the circular of the central

committee of the Kentucky Educational Association dated the

5th instant, and regret extremely that an engagement of long

standing will prevent me from attending the convention in Louis-

ville on the 19th.

  I earnestly hope that one of the important results of the con-

vention will be to strengthen the sentiment in favor of national

aid to popular education in the several States in proportion to

the necessity for such aid. Almost all of the States have estab-

lished by law suitable systems of public instruction. A consid-

erable number of them lack the pecuniary means to make their

school systems efficient. Universal education is the common

interest of the whole people. To promote it the whole people

should cheerfully contribute what is necessary from the treasury.

                      With great respect,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  MR. WILLIAM J. DAVIS,

    Louisville.









<B>124          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  September  16, 1883.  Sunday.--Mrs. John N. Jewett, of

Chicago, left us last night in the ten o'clock train after a charm-

ing visit of four days. She was an old schoolmate of Lucy.

They talked of old times joyously and often with deep feeling.

Mrs. Jewett has unusual taste in home adornment. We were in

the midst of a change to give us a bathroom next to our sleeping

room. Mrs. Jewett entered into the spirit of the work. She

did some famous things.  The fine curtains of the Temperance

ladies were put up in the small parlor; the portraits of Lucy

were changed; one from my "den" to the library parlor, and

one from Fanny's chamber to my den; the white walls of my

den were papered with a rich dark red paper; the chimney jamb

in the hall was hung with swords and Indian and Japanese work

on a background of the same rich red paper; and finally the arch

in the dining room was arranged into a cabinet for bric-a-brac

in the same style. A mighty change for four days. Mrs.

Jewett's improvements will recall a charming woman and friend

for many years

  September 26.--A  cruel injustice has been done to a pure

and good man, an excellent preacher, and a true and devoted

Christian. Idle gossip about imprudent but not in the least licen-

tious conduct with women is the pretext. This leaves the church

which we have attended, and to which Mrs. Hayes belongs,

divided and inharmonious.  This lack of unity and concord will

continue until repentance and reparation do their work in behalf

of our injured pastor or until time and changes in the leading

influences of the church restore harmony. Rev. D. D. Mather,

in the midst of the building of a new church, of which he was

the projector, has been driven away. I will not remain in a

congregation so divided. If proper feeling is again restored I

will return.  I prefer the Methodist Episcopal church, but I

prefer still more peace.  We  have the congregations of other

denominations with whom we can, I think, live in peace.



                       FREMONT, OHIO, September 28, 1883.

  MY DEAR BISHOP FOSTER:--I wish to add my statement to

what the committee will say:--









             <B>VINDICATION OF DEFAMED PASTOR          125</B>



  The injustice to our pastor is so plain and vital that not to

repair it, if possible, and to the extent that is possible, would be

criminal. It would be permanently disastrous, and seriously so,

to the church and to Methodism in Fremont.

  No man can now consent to take the place of Mr. Mather

without, in the general judgment of people here, becoming acces-

sory after the fact to the wrong done.

  These are my opinions after full reflection. The work of

calumny and misrepresentation ought not to stand. The good

name of a clergyman who has been clear in his office, and the

reputation of a pure Christian woman, in humble circumstances,

and a member of the church in good standing, require that what

has been done shall be undone.

  With great respect.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  BISHOP RANDOLPH FOSTER,

    Cleveland.



  October 1, 1883.--At 8:05 A. M. with Lucy to Cleveland.

Also Elder Henderson and Kridler and Dr. Brinkerhoff to meet

Bishop Foster to procure a reversal of the decision of Conference

taking Rev. D. D. Mather from Fremont. The absurd gossip to

his prejudice was easily neutralized and the Bishop promptly

rescinded the order. This gave us great satisfaction.

  Dined with Webb and Fanny at our kinsman's (Mr. Austin).

[At] 3:50 P. M., met at depot my ward Susan Platt and Alice

Porter, en route for Farmington; also Mr. and Mrs. Hatch and

four or six young ladies going to school at Vassar, New York,

and elsewhere. Mr. Austin also with us. A pleasant journey to

New York.

  October 2.-- Reached Central Depot about 11:20 A. M.

Lucy with Mrs. Hatch to Fifth Avenue Hotel; I with Susan

and Alice to Farmington. Miss Porter not at home but Miss

Dows received us and showed us the rooms to be occupied. The

girls well suited and no homesickness. Reached [the] Fifth

Avenue 11 P. M.









<B>126          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  [October] 3.--Peabody meeting.  A good one.  Banquet in

the evening.

  October 4.--Called at Bible House on Mr. Round.  Favor-

ably impressed as to National Prison Association.<B>*</B>

  October 9. -- Election day. I hope the Republican ticket will

succeed. While I shall not vote for the prohibition amendment,

I would like to see a good, wholesome expression of temperance

sentiment.  The amendment would be something worse than a

dead letter. Its effect would be free trade in liquor. My own

work in temperance is on other lines. I criticize no well-meant

efforts in behalf of temperance.  I find no fault with sincere and

earnest temperance people, even if I think they are misled. Their

discussions will help to educate the people. Personally, I do

not resort to force--not even to the force of law--to advance

moral reforms.  I prefer education, argument, persuasion, and

above all the influence of example--of fashion. Until these

resources are exhausted I would not think of force.

  The weather is fine--a summer day. The result [of the

election] cannot be attributed to the favorite reason of the "unco

guid," viz., bad weather.



Private.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, October 11, 1883.

  DEAR MADAM:--Your note as to a cutting from the [Cleve-

land] Leader came during my absence. I am told that a sub-

sequent notice appeared showing sufficiently that the one you

refer to was wholly unauthorized. While I am fully satisfied

that temperance reform depends chiefly on education, example,

argument, and religion, I have taken no public part for or against

constitutional amendments.     Unity and  harmony  among  the

friends of temperance, are, in my judgment, of more importance

than particular measures.

                           Sincerely,

  MRS. N. B. GATES.                              R. B. HAYES.

             <B>THE TEMPERANCE CAUSE GAINS          127</B>



  October 12. -- We had an event last night. Our pastor of the

Methodist Episcopal church, Rev. D. D. Mather, in the absence

of his wife has been staying with us. Last night, however, he

was at Mr. House's in the country. But Elder Henderson, en

route for the East, chanced to come in to tea. Just before tea, at

early dark, a fine-looking young fellow called and asked for the

Methodist Episcopal minister, Mr.  Mather.       I told him  Mr.

Mather was not here, but that another Methodist Episcopal min-

ister, Elder Henderson, was here. He asked to see him. I

invited the young gentleman into the library. He asked to see

Mr. Henderson with no others present. Soon Mr. Henderson

came, saying: "The young man wants me to marry him to his

lady love who is in the buggy waiting for him to come out.  He has

a license and all seems well." I replied, "Very well. Let it be

so;" Our ladies, Lucy, Miss Carlisle, Adda, [and] the servants

(Lizzie and       ) were present.  The  [bride]groom, Peck, a

painter by trade of Green Spring, appeared favorably. The bride,

pale and frightened, was neatly dressed and appeared well; name

Weler, or as I understood it Weir. Ceremony short. We all

shook hands with the parties and they drove off as they came in

a buggy, but now as husband and wife.





Confidential.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, October 13, 1883.

  DEAR MISS WILLARD:--Your esteemed favor to Mrs. Hayes

is before me. In the hurry of a departure to New York she

wishes me to write you, and beg you to receive her thanks for

your kindness. It will not be in her power to attend your meet-

ing. She has more engagements on her hands than she can

properly attend to, and is seeking to get away from, rather than

to add to them.

  I hope you still adhere to your old faith. In spite of the

blunders and blindness of friends, the good cause still gains.

The constant forces--education, example, religion--may seem

slow in their operation, but they will not fail. In the decision









<B>128          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



of these great questions, courts, ballot-boxes, and legislatures are

not final.

               With all good wishes, sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MISS F. E. WILLARD,

    New York.



  October 27. Saturday.--Every good cause gained a victory

when the Union troops were triumphant. Our final victory was

the triumph of religion, of virtue, of knowledge. More wealth,

more comfort, better food, better shelter, and more of all these

things belonged to mankind. More education and better, more

religion and better.    During  those  four years, whatever our

motives, whatever our lives, we were fighting on  God's side.

We were doing His work. What would this country have been

if we had failed?  Lord Coleridge told us what all here now

know.

  I have the works of Emerson in attractive form -- seven

volumes. I have read them all before. I now take them up again.





                         FREMONT, OHIO, October 29, 1883.

  MY DEAR GUY:--I have, for the moment, mislaid your letter

giving the address in Europe of Miss Bettie Ballinger. To se-

cure an early transmission, I send the letters enclosed to you.

One to Mr. Lowell, our minister to England, and the other to

Mr. Morton, at Paris. They can, however, be used with any

American to whom she may wish an introduction.

  A conversation on the judgeship leads me to anticipate a party

consideration of the affair.

  The chance of your party to elect the next President now seems

better than at any time since the war. It is perhaps settled that

our Government is to be a party government. But this does

not imply a government by one party. An occasional change

seems natural and desirable. When one party has had six Presi-

dential terms, a change, merely for the sake of change, has some-

thing in its favor. But your leaders have a talent for blunder-









             <B>DEMOCRATS' BLUNDER TALENT          129</B>



ing. [Being] out of power a quarter of a century has lost to

them the faculty of statesmanship under responsibility. They

will probably throw away their chance.

                      As ever, sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  HON. GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.



        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, November 14, 1883.

  MY DEAR MISS WILLARD:--I was surprised and sorry to see

in your annual address that you are not reimbursed for your

personal outlay for engraving the Huntington portrait. The

matter  was  never  brought  to  my  attention  before.        The

photograph of the painting by Rockwood is so much more satis-

factory than the engraving, that it is to be regretted that the en-

graving was accepted. But this is no reason why the expense of

getting it up should be borne by you. If you will send me the

amount, I will see what I can do. Your autograph to a note in

this matter is to be prized, and with the understanding that I

may have the very obligation to add to my collection of auto-

graphs, I shall feel disposed to strain a point.  This on con-

dition that my name is not to be mentioned in this connection.

  With the friendly regards of Mrs. Hayes and myself.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  MISS F. E. WILLARD.





  November 18. Sunday. -- Lucy says that when her father died,

leaving in straitened circumstances her mother and three young

children, her father left fifteen or twenty slaves. The grand-

father, who died about the same time (cholera took off six of

the family), and Dr. Webb were sending their slaves to Liberia

as fast as they could, and had fully decided to set them all free.

Some of the friends of the family advised Mother Webb to sell

the slaves.  Her reply was: "Before I will sell a slave, I will

take in washing to support my family."

  MY DEAR WEBB:--You know I do not explain or deny state-

ments as to incidents of my Administration. But when a misstate-

ment is corrected by an editor on his own responsibility, the case

is different. I would be glad if Mr. Cowles [editor of the Cleve-

land Leader] would insert something like this which is enclosed.

The letters I send you, if shown by you to Mr. Cowles, will en-

able him to do it. If he will do it without referring to me, I

would like it. The fact is, Senator Edmunds and his family

were our friends, and intimate at the White House.

                           Sincerely,

  W. C. HAYES,                                   R. B. HAYES.

    Cleveland.



  November 30. -- Our Thanksgiving was a happy one.  All of

the family were at home. With Lucy, Birch, Webb and Scott

attended a union service at the Presbyterian church. Mr. Swan-

ton, of the German Reformed [church], preached an appropriate

sermon, other clergymen taking part in the services.

  General Comly and wife, with their daughter, Susie, and their

sons, Guy and Smith, and Mr. and Mrs. Mather dined with us.

A happy time with the general and his interesting family.  Old

war scenes the leading topic.





Private.                  FREMONT, OHIO, December 2, 1883.

  MY DEAR MR. REID:--If you want Mr. Blaine's plan to float,

why not connect it with education? Let the whiskey tax go to

the States in aid of universal education. The capital objection to

distribution is that the States will, as heretofore, waste the money.

Confine it therefore to education. You will in this way enlist a

powerful and growing sentiment in favor of the plan.

  When a friend does a conspicuously good thing I always want

to tell him that it is known and appreciated and congratulate him

upon it.  Now you are doing great things all the time.  Every

morning it [the New York Tribune] comes to I know not how

many people. You send out the best newspaper in the world;









             <B>BLAINE'S TAX DISTRIBUTION PLAN          131</B>



more than that, the best newspaper that ever was in the world.

I heartily congratulate you.

                           Sincerely,

  WHITELAW REID,                                 R. B. HAYES.

    New York.



  December 8.  Saturday.--I went to Cincinnati Tuesday to

attend [a] Loyal Legion meeting. A good visit at Herron's. The

meeting of the Loyal Legion was interesting. Thursday evening

with Mrs. Herron to the ex-army and navy officers' lecture by

General Cox.  He gave us an admirable narrative of the Ohio

situation the first three months of the war.

  Lucy left for Chicago Tuesday. By the papers I see that

Mrs. Jewett gave her a notable reception Thursday evening. I

returned in the rain last night. Scott got on the train at Clyde.

  Tonight I am alone in the house. I attended Croghan Lodge,

Number 77, I. O. O. F., with Brother I. M. Keeler. Paid my

dues to Brother Underhill for one year. Saw the record of my

initiation between thirty and forty years ago. . . .  I will

spend the evening with my correspondence which is four days in

arrears.

  December 11.  Tuesday.--The Bible Society of the county

held its meeting for the year yesterday. The old officers were re-

elected. Another canvass of the county to collect money and sup-

ply all destitute families will be had in 1884-5. Once in five years

seems to be regarded as sufficient. General Buckland, Dr. Stil-

well, and myself were added to the executive committee; or

rather with the secretary, Mr. Keeler, and the treasurer, Mr.---,

were made the committee.





                          SPIEGEL GROVE, December 11, 1883.

  MY DEAR DAUGHTER: -- Your excellent report and the grace-

ful little note came to make me happy yesterday.

  Yes, lonely is a feeble word for it. One night I was the sole

occupant for several hours of the Spiegel! But no ghosts ap-

peared; neither good nor bad spirits showed themselves.









<B>132          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Your mother and Adda must be having enjoyment in Chicago.

They will not return before Saturday and may make their ab-

sence a round fortnight.

  Do you see the wonderful sunsets of this charming weather?

Make it an appointment to meet the sun as he departs in all his

glory every night as long as he displays such brilliancy. To see

him rise is also well, but his setting must not be lost.

  I am glad to hear you are practicing bookkeeping. To keep

accurate accounts promotes economy and you know what econ-

omy is the road to -- if not to heaven, at least to peace of mind.

  Two weeks to your coming. I wish it was half a day or less.

"Delighted to see you"? Why, "of course" --"tourse," as you

used to say.

  The scholarship of the report was altogether satisfactory.

"Deportment 83"--that is fair.  But I want to see it go up.

Can't you make it one hundred!  Try it.

              Affectionately, your loving father,

  MY DARLING: -- You are enjoying the Chicago visit; therefore

make the most of it. The movement of the household is satisfac-

tory. Hattie is perfect.

  Scott pleased Birch at the theatre. [John McCullough as

Brutus.] He was cool and observant. Knowing the play, he

was able to remark on omissions, changes, and what was coming

next, to the surprise of those near him, and to the delight of his

admiring older brother.

  I have an excellent letter and an excellent report from Fanny.

Her most enthusiastic utterance was, "Only two weeks to Christ-

mas!" . . .

  MY DARLING: -- The lovely Indian summer still continues. All

well. . . .    I wrote in reply to the editor of the temperance

organ at Chicago, Miss Willard, that you were there, but that

she must not urge more duties on you, and explained our position

and "work."  If she calls you need promise nothing but smother

her with politeness.

  With all good words and thoughts for all -- Adda included.

                        Affectionately,

                         FREMONT, OHIO, December 19, 1883.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--Your friendly blows were put in the

right place. The new Democratic organ at Cincinnati got crooked

notions about me, I fear from Hoadly.  It has been full of ma-

licious slings. Your hearty talk pleases me not a little.

  Thanks for your paper [the Toledo Commercial].       Its good-

natured, hopeful tone is capital. Good for Toledo, good for you,

good, every way! It will be a builder-up. I must not bore you

with my gratitude. You know how it is.

  With all good wishes for you and yours.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--There is an error of amount in the church business

not ten but five thousand dollars is my obligation.  To be exact,

I agree to pay one-quarter the cost of the church. It will be

eighteen to twenty thousand dollars.  Not important.--H.

  December 21.--In my next [speech] I will quote from the

letters of Emerson to Carlyle. The man having the best head and

the best heart of any scholar of our day said in 1864, "that view-

ing all the nationalities of the world, the battle for humanity is









<B>134          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



at this hour in America."  "I shall always," said he, "respect

war hereafter. The cost of life, the dreary havoc of comfort

and time are overpaid by the vistas it opens of Eternity."







                        FREMONT, OHIO, December 22, 1883.

  MY DEAR MR. RHEEM: -- I was glad to get your friendly letter.

It recalled old times and old friends.   It brought back freshly

the scenes of childhood. The farm up the river; the tannery

across the street; Delaware Run; the mill-pond where Lorenzo

was drowned; the sulphur spring; "Little's World"; the "Irish

Section," and the big hill. I could see again, as I read, Mother

and Uncle, Fanny and Mrs. Wasson, Thomas and Means Was-

son, the Vinings, the Agards, the Worlines, the Van Bremers.

Then there were some victims of drink, as old John Wilson, Sol.

Smith, Pettigrew, and others. Of course I do not forget the

prominent citizens, Judge Williams, Mr. Little, Powers, Mauser,

Dr. Hills, Rev. Henry Vandeman, Dunlap, Dr. Lamb, and the

rest. Of boys of my own age, I remember Lewis Brush, Edwin

Cowles, Charlie Mauser, Manley Covell, Sidney Moore, Cyrus

Platt, and many besides.

  I am glad you are well. It is my good fortune to have fine

health. Our children will all spend the holidays with us. The

two younger, Fanny and Scott, have come home from school.

The three grown boys have been well started in life and promise

to be good men.

  As to my Administration, I am content to leave its merits to

the judgment of candid men. It found the country in distress

and perplexed with difficult and dangerous questions. It left the

country prosperous and happy, and with the money question,

the Southern question, the Indian question, the civil service ques-

tion, the Chinese question, and others either settled or in the

process of settlement finally and happily.

  It found its party weak, divided, and defeated in Congress.

It left its party united, strong, and triumphant in Congress and

before the people.









             <B>PAYNE FOR SENATE BAD POLITICS          135</B>



  But this is aside from the holidays. I speak of it because you

allude to politics and my Administration.

  All good wishes, I am glad to send to you, my old friend.

                          Sincerely,

  SAMUEL RHEEM,                                  R. B. HAYES.

    Delaware, Ohio.



  December 23. Sunday.--A fine evening with "all the boys"

and Miss Sherman and Miss Miller. Finished the Emerson-

Carlyle correspondence. Found the exact facts, in various vol-

umes, of the landing of the Pilgrims. An exploring party of ten

or so in a shallop left the Mayflower and on the 11th [of] De-

cember, O. S., 1620, landed at Plymouth. Pleased with the

"situation," they returned to the Mayflower, and on the 16th

O. S. many from the ship also landed--men and women.  The

Mayflower was not finally left until after they had built "their

first house," December 25.

  December 25. -- Lucy sent books to twelve boys, her Sunday-

school class, such as "School Days at Rugby," "Swiss Family

Robinson," and the like; and to one a knife. The servants were

called in and Fanny, Adda, and the boys and old folks, all of

whom had presents.

  December 30.--This  is the anniversary of our wedding.

Thirty-one years of happy married life! Darling Lucy. She is

now in excellent health.

  January 1, 1884. -- Lucy engaged at the new church, afternoon

and evening until 8 P. M., making the Sunday[-school] children

happy with a Christmas tree donated by the Presbyterians. It

was gay with candles, and stockings filled with candy, and fes-

tooned with strings of popcorn and cranberries. All a simple

affair, but as happiness-giving as the more expensive affairs of

the great cities.

  January 9. -- Payne is nominated -- the nomination signifying

an election -- by the Democratic caucus for Senator in place of

Pendleton. Mr. Payne is seventy-three years old; able, conserva-









<B>136          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tive, well-meaning. Taken altogether, a Senator for Ohio to be

content with. Politically it was a mistake. Pendleton was beaten

solely because he was for civil service reform.   One delegation

from Dayton lobbying against him wore on their badges the

motto, "To the Victors Belong the Spoils."

  I. To defeat Pendleton for this reason disgusts the Inde-

pendents--a body that embraces intelligence, wealth, and in-

creasing numbers. None of them will feel friendly to the Demo-

cratic party until this slap in the face is forgotten.

  2. The workingmen's party is on the threshold, under Butler

and others demagogues, of organizing independently as a new

third party. It cannot support a party which elects one so identi-

fied with great corporations as Mr. Payne is. To them he is

the great monopolist of the State. The votes of the "working-

men" largely belong to the Democratic party.      Their loss will

destroy the power of the Democracy.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, January 10, 1884.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--I send you enclosed a hasty and brief

sketch [of the battle of Cedar Creek] by General Comly. He

is editor of a daily paper at Toledo, a gentleman of character

and talents.

  I prefer not to add to his sketch. In the fight to save Sheri-

dan's headquarters, my horse was killed under me and I was

painfully wounded, but not compelled to leave the field. My pro-

motion to brigadier-general was made "to date from October

19, 1864, for gallant and meritorious services in the battles of

Winchester, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek." You would, I

am sure, not disparage, without the gravest reasons, an officer

of such solid merits as General George Crook. He was in the

immediate command of the Army of West Virginia during the

whole of the battle of Cedar Creek.

                 With best wishes, sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--During the present winter I have been forced to use

a crutch a short time from the effects of the injury received at









             <B>CAUSES OF CEDAR CREEK DISASTER          137</B>



Cedar Creek -- a combination of rheumatism and the old wound.

--H.

  P. P. S.--The First Division of Crook's Command at Cedar

Creek was commanded by Colonel Thoburn, of Wheeling, West

Virginia. He was killed in the action near Middletown. He

was a conscientious, noble gentleman, of unflinching courage,

and in all respects able, and worthy to command the division

under him. If you knew all the facts you would, I am confident,

attach no blame to him. I have attributed the disaster of the

morning at Cedar Creek to

  1. The withdrawal of the cavalry outpost from the right

bank of the Shenandoah, on the left of our army, thus enabling

Early to reach and pass the river on our left and rear unob-

served.

  2. To leaving our left front with a line of works far too long

for the small force charged with its defence.  In broad daylight

with ample notice, Colonel Thoburn's division, if not reinforced,

would probably have been overwhelmed by the superior num-

bers of the masses that attacked it.

  I do not speak of the cause for these errors.  General Comly

has no doubt hit the nail on the head in explaining the blame,

which has, in some quarters, attached to Crook's command. The

command was called sometimes "the Eighth Corps" and some-

times "The Army of West Virginia."  In fact on that morning

it had hardly the strength of a division and was divided, part

being in front, and part a mile to the rear "in reserve."--H.

  P. S. -- On reading again General Comly's letter, I notice some

slight errors in his account of my movements at the close of the

day, but they are not material to the main purpose of his letter.

--H.

  MAJOR JOHN M. GOULD,

    Portland, Maine.



  January 11, 1884. Friday. -- Mrs. Herron left us this morn-

ing. A delightful visit with her. She is one of the lovely wo-

men -- beautiful still, cultured, admirable mind and temper; re-

minds me constantly of my dear sister Fanny. I took her to the









<B>138          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



station in the one-horse sleigh and sent Rutherford with her (her

health being still uncertain) to Cleveland.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, January 14, 1884.

  DEAR SIR:--I have your letter showing that Eliza Jane [for-

mer servant, colored] is in poor health, and needs aid. I send you

five dollars to be expended in making her comfortable. If you

get it safely, and tell me how you spend it for her, I will send

again immediately the like amount.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  JAMES BUCKNER.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, January 18, 1884.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Camp (J. A.) has notice that his services as

special agent will not be required after February 1. I believe,

as he states, that he is a valuable officer.  He wishes to remain

until he can resign -- would like the time extended a few months.

I do not know as [that] you can say or do anything, but venture

to name it.

  You, of course, know that you are constantly spoken of for

President. The general is also a favorite. I am glad you are both

entirely passive. But it may be satisfactory to you to be assured

that the best citizens in Ohio uniformly speak with great favor

of your candidacy. I do not ask you to say a word in reply to

this. -- We are all in usual health.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.

Private and confidential.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, January 23, 1884.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I rarely notice in any way, and never

publicly, attacks or reflections on my official action when I was

President. But I venture to write you a word on what you are

reported to have said in your speech for the Fitz-John Porter

Relief Bill, viz.:--









             <B>CLEMENCY TO OFFICERS DEFENDED          139</B>



  "To the same cause must be attributed the course of one of our

late Chief Magistrates, in habitually reversing the findings of

these courts. Officers sentenced to dismissal for the most dis-

graceful offences were in many instances restored to the army,

greatly to the demoralization of the service."

  All court-martial cases coming before the Executive were

carefully examined by the Secretary of War, and the decision

reached was, I think, in all cases approved by him. Judge

McCrary was a sound, painstaking, and upright lawyer. The

cases criticized were for the most part decided when he was

Secretary of War. Doubtless, mistakes were made, but the mis-

takes were not "habitual" but exceptional, and were, I hope, in

all cases on the side of mercy and never on the side of severity.

They were made in a time of peace. Usually in favor of young

officers, misled by following the example, in many cases, of their

superiors. You say that these decisions caused demoralization

in the army. Please investigate and see if the officers retained in

the service are not still in the service, for the most part, and

without official complaint on account of present character or con-

duct.

  My relations with you lead me to think that you would not re-

flect on me from personal hostility or on merely partisan grounds.

My impression has been that I might confidently look to you for

fairness and candor. I do not see how the case of General Porter

can be strengthened by an attack on me.

  I mark this confidential that you may yourself be led to investi-

gate more carefully the matter referred to, and modify your own

views, not with any wish for any public attention to it.

                With great respect. Sincerely,

  GENERAL HENRY W. SLOCUM,                       R. B. HAYES.

    Washington, D. C.



                           SPIEGEL GROVE, January 29, 1884.

  MY DARLING:--Your letter to your mother came today. It

does indeed seem a great while since you left us all disconsolate.

We long for you -- for your music -- for your laugh -- for your-

self.

  Of course your good friends are always welcome -- Effie Pope

or any other.

  When you hear a good lecture I would like to have you give

me a brief abstract of it. To do this fastens it in your memory,

and enables you to make it part of your own mental equipment.



  With oceans of love, yours affectionately,

                                                        H.

  MISS FANNY HAYES.

                          FREMONT, OHIO, January 30, 1884.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--You have been invited to attend the

banquet of the Ohio Commandery of the Loyal Legion in Cincin-

nati next week. I sincerely hope you will attend.

  Our relations during the earlier years of my residence in Wash-

ington were exceedingly agreeable to me, and I shall be glad to

renew them--glad to meet you and greet as I should have done

during 1877 and 1878.

  In conclusion let me assure you that you will be warmly wel-

comed in Cincinnati by very many of your former army asso-

ciates and by

                       Yours sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL SCHOFIELD.

                          FREMONT, OHIO, January 31, 1884.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I notice that you are to be elected a

companion of the Loyal Legion next Wednesday evening. Our

yearly banquet is that evening. It occurred to me that you might

hesitate to attend--to go to a meeting--until after you are

notified of your election. I write to urge you to have no such

feeling.  You will of course be elected.  It is hoped and expected

by all concerned that you will come. The election and "invest-

[it]ure" will be just before the banquet. The request that those

in your situation shall attend has been published, but fearing you

may not have seen it, I write you.

                "Same as before." Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.









             <B>HOME RULE IN TEMPERANCE          141</B>



  P. S. -- You know, I hope, that the [enclosed] scrap is not sent

to procure a "flourish."  I merely want you to know the fact.

If referred to at all ever, let it not go beyond a line in an obscure

corner stating simply: "General R. B. Hayes has given to the

free public library in Fremont $1,000." This or nothing

  GENERAL J. M. COMLY,

  February 2. -- In reply to a letter, asking Mrs. Hayes to con-

tradict a lecturer who said "the crusade" was a failure and who

opposed prohibition, I wrote as follows:--

Confidential.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, February 2, 1884.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Your esteemed favor, addressed to Mrs.

Hayes, is before me.

  You will, I trust, on reflection, excuse Mrs. Hayes from tak-

ing part in any controversy between professed friends of tem-

perance. Believing earnestly in discussion, education, and ex-

ample, as forces whose efficiency nobody will question, she does

not wish to criticize those who adopt other lines of work in be-

half of the good cause.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  REV. ALONZO SANDERSON,

    Warren, Massachusetts.

  In short, "to rule the situation," you must get the people with

you--the very people--those who rule at the place where the

thing is to be done. Not an outside people. Home rulers are in

this matter the only rulers.

  February 6.     Wednesday.--At Burnet House [Cincinnati]

a happy day with military friends, old and new. Barnett, Buck-

land, Comly, Leggett, Enochs, Force, and so forth, and so forth.

Banquet, one hundred and sixteen plates; speeches, short and

good; singing, glorious. The most gentlemanly affair I recall.

Barnett, Leggett, and I turned down our glasses.











<B>142          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  February 7.  Thursday. -- With Birch left the hotel and went

to Herron's.  We crossed the bridge near Little Miami Depot

to Newport.  Water 61 feet 4 inches -- the highest I ever saw it.

  P. M. Birch and I went up to Highland House on the inclined

plane, Oak Street route.   Saw the flood from that point.    Not

so impressive as I expected.

  I called on the family of my old friend of schoolboy days,

George W. Jones. He died a week ago today at 7 P. M. of

pneumonia after a short illness. Had always been strong and

healthy -- a model of manly beauty.  Not often together of late

years, we were yet friends of closest intimacy since 1840. Nannie

and  Lizzie both sad and  mourning--full  of sweetness.         I



should have gone to the funeral if they had notified me.

  February 8.  Friday. -- Left Cincinnati with Birch on Bee

Line. Had to take cars on Eighth Street, in the middle of Mill

Creek Valley, now a lake--water 61:8.

  February 11.  Monday. -- [Clark] Waggoner called and spent

an hour.   Nothing new except a few facts, additional to those

I was aware of, showing in a still stronger light the shameful

character of his dismissal from the public service.

  February 19.--Bright and springlike.  Lovely day to begin

the G. A. R. fair in which Lucy is taking a large interest. The

rain and wind in the afternoon made a dismal business of it.

But in spite of all, the opening was very successful.  The sing-

ing and other exercises were good, the supper superb, and the

display of the wares, booths, and general ornamentation of the

G. A. R. Hall creditable. The two halls, the Birchard and the

new hall in the Hayes block, were used in common for the Fair.

Lucy was radiant and remained to the end, 11 P. M.

  Wednesday, February 20. -- I have a letter from Herron ac-

knowledging receipt of one hundred dollars sent to the relief of

the sufferers by the flood on the 13th.

  The broom drill of the young ladies, under their efficient drill-

master, Will Haynes, was superb.      The turnout of the people

was large; both halls well filled. Entrance ten cents. All de-









             <B>POLITICAL OUTLOOK, MARCH, 1884          143</B>



scriptions of people present. Rud appeared in "Mary Jane," a

pantomime; greeted with uproarious applause and laughter.

  February 23.  Saturday. -- The G. A. R. took the day; dined

in the hall. After dinner at 3 P. M. went to Opera House; the

broom drill to a good audience. I thanked the Broom Brigade

and their "gallant commandant" in the name of the post. The

evening was a "jam," indeed.

  The singing was good, the tableaux beautiful, the auction of

goods successful, but the money was made and the excitement

centred in the contest for the cane. A five-dollar affair which

was worked up to over six hundred dollars. The five days'

fair was a remarkable five days' festival.

  [Cleveland], February 27. -- Met with the trustees of the Adel-

bert College of Western Reserve University. Routine business

except the application of the medical college to be rid of the

Adelbert name in connection with that department. The endow-

ment of Mr. Stone was in no way for the [use] of the medical

school.  Committee appointed  to deal with the subject, viz.,

Hayes, President Cutler, Handy, Boardman, and Perkins.

  March 5.  Wednesday. -- Attended the funeral of Julia Mil-

ler, daughter of the cashier of the national [bank]. She died of

scarlet fever (age, eighteen), at school in Newton, Massachu-

setts; a lovely and beautiful girl; died suddenly, after all danger

was thought to be past.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, March 14, 1884.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I have your letter of the (early this

month). I am somewhat out of the current of information on

political events. It looks to me as if the Republicans must carry

both Ohio and New York, or lose.  Sherman, Edmunds, Lincoln,

either, perhaps, can unite Stalwarts, Half-breeds, and Independ-

ent Republicans.  All these elements are needed and with sub-

stantial unanimity. The point against the Democrats is, they will

disturb the business of the country by tinkering with the cur-

rency, the tariff, and the settlements of the war.









<B>144          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  With either Payne or McDonald, their candidate will be per-

sonally fit for the place. But New York City Democracy always

has, and still does determine the policies of the Democratic

party. How unfit and dangerous this leadership is, the history

of the last twenty-five years sufficiently shows.

  This in a general way is my notion of the situation.

                          Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

   [Unaddressed.]



  March 15. -- Today Lucy and Adda go to Pickaway and Ross

Counties to attend the funeral of John Boggs, uncle by marriage

of Lucy and Adda. He was about seventy-six years of age. A

man of business ability, wealthy; with wit and humor beyond,

far beyond, the average. Good company; a staunch Democrat;

voted once for me! I shall miss him greatly on my visits to

Lucy's kinsfolk.

  March 16.  Sunday. -- A lonely house without Lucy and Adda.

Evening, Birch read aloud seventeen cantos of Dante.

  [Cleveland], March 20. Thursday. -- Came here yesterday.

Was met at station by Mr. Boardman who took me to his pleas-

ant home on Euclid Avenue. This morning with President

Cutler, Mr. Perkins, Dr. Bushnell, Mr. Boardman, trying to ar-

range a new organization for Western Reserve University which

would remove the objections of the medical department to the

present title. I saw Mr. John Hay [son-in-law of Amasa J.

Stone]. He talked sensibly and in a good spirit. He recog-

nized the difficulty of the name; was ready as one of the heirs

of Mr. Stone to do what was reasonable; would favor an

organization of the medical department with the name "The

Medical College of Western Reserve University."

  P. M. met the above again with the addition of Mr. Handy

and Dr. Webber. Agreed that I should prepare alternative char-

ters--one simply Western Reserve University, and the other,

The Medical College of Western Reserve University, and submit

to Colonel Hay when he was in better health--say, next week.

In my interview with Colonel Hay I said: "I must still think he









             <B>THE CINCINNATI RIOT          145</B>



wrote a part of 'The Bread Winners'"; that it was very good,

that he had a hand in it, etc., etc. He began to speak (probably

in denial), I stopped him and changed the subject. I still think

I was right. [So the event proved.]

  March 26.  Wednesday.--Attended teachers' institute.  Pro-

fessor Marsh was lecturing on pronunciation and the mode of

teaching it. Did so very entertainingly. I spoke to the intelligent

young people a few words on industrial education.

  March 31. Monday. -- The riot in Cincinnati -- burning of

the court-house! A bad bad! How to fight mobs in cities?  A

good police. A good military organization. Arm the police with

revolvers and clubs. The military should have, in addition to

military long-range rifles, short-range fowling-pieces. No danger

to distant citizens. A grist of buck or small shot to clear the

streets.

  April 4, 1884. -- Went to Cincinnati April 1; attended a pleas-

ant meeting of the Loyal Legion, [April] 2. The recitations by

Murdock were very entertaining. Dined with General Force.

Present,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R. W. Burnett  and  David  Horton.

[April] 3, Thursday, in Cleveland to organize The New Western

Reserve University.  All looks well.  Home, today.

  April 9.  [Wednesday.--Judge Drake has delivered an opinion

of the Court of Claims that my action in the case of Benjamin P.

Runkle was illegal and void. My opinion was clear that Runkle

on the merits was entitled to a reversal of the sentence of the

court martial against him. On the legal points, the Secretary of

War, Judge McCrary, sustained the action taken. If there was

error on technical or legal points, it was on the side of humanity,

equity, and substantial justice.

  April 10. Thursday. -- Fanny came home this evening at

seven from her school at Cleveland to spend ten days with us.

Happy days for us. Her scholarship is excellent by the reports.

She is sweet, tender, and sensible.

  April 14.  Monday.--With Lucy and Fanny to Toledo.  The

Green Spring Academy and its union [with] Adelbert College

   10









<B>146          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



my chief business.  Met Judge J. W. Cummings and Rev. Dr.

McGaw on the subject.

  The Loyal Legion [men of Toledo] called and tendered me

a dinner [on] the 30th. General Fuller, General Comly, Cap-

tain Austin, Major Bliven, committee.

  April 15. Tuesday.--On 8 o'clock train to Cleveland. Met

the gentlemen of the Western Reserve University at Mr. Joseph

Perkins' office and organized the new university. Present, W.

J. Boardman, Dr. Webber, President Cutler, T. P. Handy, Judge

Williamson, Joseph Perkins. I was made chairman; Judge Wil-

liamson, secretary. Regulations adopted. It was announced by

Dr. Webber that a gentleman was ready to advance the funds

for a fine building and the endowment of a medical department.

  April 19. -- The elections of delegates to the Chicago Repub-

lican convention show Blaine to be the favorite candidate. Pos-

sibly not enough so to nominate him. He is clearly in advance

largely of any other leader, but may not get more delegates than

all others combined. He fails in two points as a candidate. He

lacks the confidence of thoughtful, high-minded, and patriotic

people. They doubt his personal integrity; they think he is a

demagogue. Besides, his record as a partisan places him in oppo-

sition to large elements of the party. The Stalwart element, the

Grant men of 1880, do not like him, and the independent men

oppose him. He is therefore not the most available man and not

the best man named for the office. Either Edmunds, Lincoln,

or Sherman would be a better President and a better candidate.

He does not belong to the class of leaders of whom Hamilton,

Jefferson, Clay, Calhoun, Seward, Lincoln, and Webster are types.

He is of the Butler and Douglas type--more like Douglas in

character and position than any other of the great leaders of the

past. Clay would rather be right than be President. Blaine

would gladly be wrong to be President. I still hope Edmunds

may be the nominee, or Lincoln, or Sherman.

  April 24, 1884.  Thursday. -- Visited McPherson lodge I. O.

O. F. and saw the "team work." The sculptors are right about

the awkwardness of a statue in modern dress--pantaloons and

frock coat. Men in the picturesque costumes of knights and









             <B>WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY          147</B>



oriental personages, who are common-looking in their usual

dress, become graceful and dignified figures.

  April 27.  Sunday.--Attended meeting yesterday of board

of trustees of the Western Reserve University at Cleveland. We

elected officers. President, Cutler; secretary, Bushnell; treasurer,

Bushnell; Executive committee--Cutler, Andrews, Williamson,

Wood, and ---.

  Mr. Wood (John L.) gives a quarter of a million of dollars

to found the medical department. This is the first fruit of the

organization of the Western Reserve University.

  President Cutler, Rev. Dr. Bushnell, and myself talked over the

affairs of the Green Spring Academy. It was agreed that some-

thing like this [plan giving the college control of the academy]

should be reported, and it is the opinion of the committee that

it will be sanctioned by the board of trustees of the Adelbert

College: . . .

  1. Green Spring Academy to be adopted by the college as

one of its preparatory schools.

  2. The college to control and carry it on by means of the

right to name a majority of its board of trustees.

  3. The graduation in the classical course of the academy to

admit without examination to the college.

  4. The college to assist the academy as follows, viz., by a

loan without interest of the sum of seventy-five hundred dollars,

to be repaid by the roll of scholarships which shall be good either

at the college or the academy at the option of the holders; a

permanent scholarship to be five hundred dollars; a scholarship

for our college or academical course, one hundred dollars.

  5. The form of subscription for scholarships to be substan-

tially the following:--"We, the subscribers, promise to pay the

sum set opposite our respective names to the trustees of the

Green Spring Academy for the benefit of said academy.

  "Each subscription of five hundred dollars shall entitle the

donor to a permanent scholarship in Green Spring Academy or

if preferred in Adelbert College of Western Reserve University,

and each subscription of one hundred dollars shall entitle the

donor to a scholarship for four years either in the academy or

the College at the option of the subscriber.









<B>148          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  "These subscriptions to be payable within sixty days after the

aggregate amount of the same reaches the sum of six thousand

dollars."

  6. The amounts collected on said subscription to be paid to

the college by the academy for the sum loaned as provided in

number 4.

  April 29. Tuesday. -- Decoration Day I am to follow the

regular orator, Dr. Kemper, at Springfield. My topic will again

be "National Aid to Education." After discussing this, I will

turn to the points: But our system of education is not perfect. It

fails to fit young men and women for the practical duties of

life. It lacks training in the skill and habits of manual labor.

True: and I would reform the present system in this particu-

lar. What the Slater Board is doing.

  April 30. Wednesday. -- We go to Toledo to attend a lunch

given to Mrs. Hayes and myself by the Companions of the Loyal

Legion in Toledo.

  May 1, 1884. -- We had a happy meeting with the Companions

and their wives last evening. Present: General and Mrs. Fuller,

General and Mrs. Comly, General and Mrs. Young, Captain and

Mrs. Richard Waite, Major and Mrs. Norman Waite, Captain

and Mrs. Osborn, Chaplain and Mrs. Bacon, Colonel and Mrs.

Bell, Mrs. Judge Austin, Mrs. Henry Waite, Major and Mrs.

Bliven, Captain Mattox, Captain Bigelow, Birchard Hayes and

Adda, myself and wife. No toasts, no speeches, no nonsense --

a quiet social time. After 11 P. M. we attended the reception

at William Baker's--also a brilliant affair.

  May 7.  Wednesday. -- At Cincinnati; evening Loyal Legion.

Reelected commander on recommendation of both committees.

   Thursday, May 8. -- To Berea with General Leggett and Major

Rix; thence home. Dispatches of death of Mr. Slater at Nor-

wich, Connecticut. Left home at 10:30 P. M. to Toledo. Took

train for New York, after a three-hour nap at Toledo.

   May 10. Saturday. -- At 8 A. M., train to New Haven, New

 London, and Norwich. Met Daniel Chadwick on train near his









             <B>DEATH OF JOHN F. SLATER          149</B>



town, Lyme; Mr. Jesup at New London. At Norwich were met

by Mr. C. C. Johnson with a carriage; thence to the home of our

deceased friend, the wise giver, Mr. Slater. The funeral well

attended. Good men praise him. His employes mourn. The

preacher, Mr. Howe, delivered a capital sermon.

  May 11. Sunday. -- The guest of Moses Pierce [at Norwich].

His family, a widowed daughter and her daughter Kitty, age

sixteen, and an unmarried daughter. Mr. Pierce, an intelligent,

pious man; successful manufacturer, friend of Elihu Burritt;

an old-line abolitionist.

  May 12.  Monday. -- Rode with Mr. Pierce around Norwich,

looking at the fine old trees and the attractive town. Met Mr.

D. A. Wells -- earnestly  for free trade of course, and full of

interesting and zealous talk.

  Cleveland, May 14, 1884.  Wednesday. -- Called on C. C.

Baldwin. Joined Western Reserve Historical Society. After-

noon at rooms of Mr. Ryder looking at the model and designs

for Garfield monument. I have two ideas: A conspicuous, lofty

tower, and, for the nearer view, a striking statute, heroic size,

of General Garfield.  Both seem to me requisite.

  May 17.  Saturday.--If the boss system is to go down, as

now seems probable, I can say I struck the first and most diffi-

cult blows. It is based on Congressional patronage and Sena-

torial prerogative, or courtesy. This was fully entrenched at

Washington when I was inaugurated in 1877. The first step in

a reform of the civil service was to break it down. As long as

the lawmaking power held the power of appointment, that is,

"the patronage," there could be no legislation in behalf of reform.

Any reform was at the expense of the power of the Senator and

the Representative.

  The first and principal step was the appointment of members

of the Cabinet. This belonged, according to the prevailing sys-

tem, to the leaders of the party in the Senate. A Cabinet of in-

dependent men was organized. The Cabinet, it was claimed by

the champions of the boss system, should be formed not un-

friendly to the system. The announcement of the names of Mr.









<B>150          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Evarts and Mr. Schurz, both independent men, both opposed

by the bosses, opened the war. Appointments were soon made

in all directions, not dictated by the leaders. From that moment

the Stalwart leaders and the newspapers who followed them, and

their rank and file, have assailed my conduct, character, and

motives with the utmost bitterness. But let the heathen rage!

The good work has made great advances. The principal steps

have been:

  1. The appointment of the Cabinet in 1877 and the general

course of the Hayes appointments without heeding the dictation

of Senators and Representatives. 2. The defeat of Conkling in

the custom house conflict, which made a business institution of

the New York custom house.        3. The defeat of Conkling and

Platt, their dismissal from public life in 1881.    4. The defeat

of the bosses at Chicago in 1880.

  I directed Mr. Jackman to plant trees around the street fronts

of our new Methodist church -- four elms on east front and three

maples on south front. The work seems to be well done.

  May 18.  I must this week prepare my remarks for Decora-

tion Day at Springfield.  I am to follow Dr. Kemper, of Cin-

cinnati, who will make a scholarly and attractive address. Mine

will be more offhand and practical. Education needed to secure

the fruits of the Union victory -- a practical, industrial system

of education especially in the South.

  May 19, Monday. -- Lucy and Adda start this morning for

Philadelphia to attend the Woman's Home  Missionary Society

meeting at Philadelphia, where the General Conference of the

Methodist Episcopal Church is now in session. A lonely home

for a few days.



                            FREMONT, OHIO, May 24, 1884.

  MY DEAR S--:--It is good for heart and brain to see your

familiar handwriting again. The article you send is every way

excellent.  That is work you are fond of.  It is perhaps not

your specialty.  Practical statesmanship--the higher walks of

politics--is probably your forte, but when there is nothing to









             <B>ACHIEVEMENTS OF ADMINISTRATION          151</B>



do in that field, history is your place -- biographical history par-

ticularly. I wish you were not so overworked.

  The life of Clay is in other hands. Is Lincoln adequately done?

It seems to me there is a vacant place.

           With all good wishes ALWAYS. Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.





  May 26.--Mr. Ward of the Independent wants to write an

editorial on the rather sneering tone of Beecher's speech at the

Arthur meeting. He (Beecher) spoke of my Administration as

providing the poultice the country needed, and then going to

sleep; that "Hayes sleeps yet."<B>*</B> Not at all important. But the

settlement of the Southern question was not a sleepy affair.  The

resumption of specie payments and the veto of the bill to cripple

the banks is not forgotten by business men. The six vetoes of the

laws to protect the rights at elections in the South of colored peo-

ple, the Chinese veto, and the Mexican troubles settled, Indian

outrages redressed and justice done and a policy adopted of which

education, the ownership of homes, and ultimate citizenship are

leading features. The corner-stone of a reform of the civil ser-

vice was laid by the overthrow of the Senatorial and Congres-

sional patronage [and] the rule of the bosses, and the putting the

New York custom house on a business basis, make a record of

beneficial and wise activity for the Hayes Administration which

will not suffer by comparison with that of any Administration in

time of peace during the present century. Mr. Beecher is a Stal-

wart. His favorite, Mr. Arthur, is a Stalwart except when driven

into reform positions by a public sentiment which he dare not

resist. Mr. Beecher knows that he [Arthur] stood in the way

of every reform; that he shared with Conkling the unenviable

notoriety of wielding "the machine" in New York politics, until

he was overwhelmed by the Waterloo of 1882.



<FONT SIZE="-1">   * Edward Bok ("Americanization," p. 87) says Mr. Beecher deeply

regretted his words, and the same night wrote Mr. Hayes a long letter

of apology.  "It was a superbly fine letter.  And the reply was no less

fine." -- No such letter of apology among Hayes papers.</FONT>









<B>152          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  May 28. Wednesday. -- Lucy returned in excellent health and

spirits after a fine trip and visit to Philadelphia and Cleveland.

  McKinley was unseated yesterday. But the vote in his favor

given by six Democrats -- so many of them leaders (Dorsheimer,

Hurd, Blackburn, Mills, Robinson)--and [by] the crank, White

(Republican), against him is a vote of admiration and a certifi-

cate of character.

  June 8. Sunday. -- Returned last evening after an absence

since Tuesday to Cincinnati Loyal Legion and to Cleveland. The

event of the week is the nomination of Blaine at Chicago. Mr.

Blaine is not an admirable person. He is a scheming demagogue,

selfish and reckless. But he is a man of ability and will, if

elected, be a better President than he has been [a] politician.

He will, I think, try to have the support of the best people and

to make a creditable record. I will therefore support him in

preference to the Democratic candidate. He was fairly nomi-

nated. The Republican masses were for him. There is no sus-

picion of machine influence as the means of his nomination.





                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 11, 1884.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I do not recall giving the order to occupy

the church [at Raleigh, Virginia].  Perhaps a statement merely

that it was occupied as a military necessity would do.  I am not,

however, in the least solicitous about it.

  You have steered through the narrows of the last few weeks

so skilfully that you deserve the good luck there is in your pres-

ent position. I think Ohio will come up to the support of the

ticket handsomely. Those who persist in dissenting are so wise

and so good that it makes a streak of folly and wickedness seem

refreshing.  There!  How is that for a "Sunday-school politi-

cian"?

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES,

  GENERAL J. M. COMLY,

    Toledo.

                                     SPIEGEL, June 12, 1884.

  MY  DEAR S--:--Thanks  for your excellent letter of the

9th. No doubt you see the situation as it is. It is not encourag-

ing. Even Tilden might possibly have gone through. I see no

chance in New York. That means the success of the Democrats.

  You cannot afford to lose your treasures. No one can expect

you to do it. Why not send word that you are preparing a book

in which you will use all of your collection, which is not already

found in books, about Clay and his times; but that if there is

any point on which light is wanted, you will cheerfully give

what you have on the point named. You are not to write books,

or hunt up materials for others. It is going far enough if you aid

them on points they are investigating. Schurz is a fair man and

will see this as we do. Try it.

  Try to drop in on me.  I am to be home all summer.--Our

regards to Mrs. Smith and yours.

                          Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES,

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



Private.

                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 13, 1884.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I heartily congratulate you on your tri-

umphant nomination. Its unanimity--the whole manner of it

--is very gratifying. While I preferred other nominations at

Chicago, and regard the result as a blunder and misfortune, I can-

not think of the election of a Democrat as anything but a serious

calamity. That result can now only be avoided by a skill in go-

ing amiss by the Democrats which even they will, I fear, not ex-

hibit. We ought to save Ohio. Can we?

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL C. H. GROSVENOR.





  June 14.  Saturday.--As to temperance parties.  All resorts

to political parties and methods are appeals to the majority. Suc-

cess, if it comes, must be by reason of popularity. That is the









<B>154          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



best that can be said of the movement.  Now, when a reform is

so popular as that the true reformer has left it,-he has taken up

something else, has gone forward,--the reform will take care

of itself.

  June 15.  Sunday -- President Merrick of Delaware our guest.

President Merrick at Wilbraham Academy with Abel Stevens

formed perhaps the first Total Abstinence Society--in 1830

or 1831.



Confidential.

                               FREMONT, OHIO, June 24, 1884.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your favor of the 21st is before me. The

party referred to has been a friend from my youth--of more

than forty years' standing. He is a capable business man of great

force and will [be] very likely to succeed in anything he under-

takes. Some years ago he received a severe injury in his head.

He has seemed not so steady and reliable since.  I would not ad-

vise a young man of the character of your friend to form the con-

nection proposed. I dislike to say this, and must rely on your

prudence and fidelity to so deal that I will not lose an old friend.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  E. MARINER, ESQUIRE.



  June 27. -- At Cleveland decided in favor of George Keller's

design for the Garfield Monument. A tower and a portrait statue

of Garfield.

  The study of tools as well as of books should have a place in

the public schools. Tools, machinery, and the implements of the

farm should be made familiar to every boy, and suitable indus-

trial education should be furnished for every girl.





                              FREMONT, OHIO, June 29, 1884.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I have your note of the 26th instant. There is

no portrait of me in the White House.  If one is placed there it

should be either a full length or two-thirds length.  I like the









             <B>PUBLIC OPINION AND TEMPERANCE          155</B>



 size of Mr. Van Buren's portrait.  When I went to the White

 House eight portraits of the Presidents were lacking. I managed

 to get them all during my term. I prefer the committee should

 select the artist. I like Mr. Huntington of New York, the artist

 who painted the portrait of Mrs. Hayes. Whatever you decide

 will be agreeable to me.          Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES,

   P. S.--A bust portrait may be the best size. If so in your

 judgment, let it be so.

   HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

     Washington.



   July 9. Wednesday.--Father Bowles, of the Irish Catholic

Church, has a temperance gathering of Irish Catholics today at

the fair ground.

  All agree, saloon men even will admit, that excessive drinking

--intemperance, drunkenness--is evil, and evil only; is a vice

and the gateway to poverty, disgrace, and crime. But what of

moderate drinking--of the social, festive, convivial, fashionable

use of the intoxicating glass? It is the road, the only road to

drunkenness. It is useless, wasteful, dangerous. Let it be con-

demned by public opinion, by fashion, by the law. Let it be made

unfashionable, disgraceful, unlawful.

  I would not, if I could, direct torrents of ridicule or indigna-

tion to pour upon the heads of any class of citizens engaged in

lawful pursuits. But any individuals of any class that sell liquor

to minors, to inebriates, deserve the heaviest penalties which

society inflicts. The real blame, the sin, the crime of this whole

business--the drink habit as it exists in this country--are all

due to the public. Public opinion could dry it up, could extirpate

it, as thoroughly as larceny or burglary are prevented. Sin exists

--will exist; vice is a part of our probation; temptation is before

us. Drunkenness will exist, perhaps, but not as now openly--

fashionable and laudable. An esteemed friend, a very intelligent

man, said to me not long ago, "This habit will always exist. It

can't be broken up." Not so. Except as the thief exists.









<B>156          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  July 12.  Saturday. -- The Democratic nominations at Chicago

are Cleveland and Hendricks. Cleveland will be satisfactory to

the Independent Republicans. He will draw also from the Ger-

mans. However, they are to be classed as Independent Republi-

cans. The result depends on the Irish and Tammany bolters

from the nominations. If they generally support the ticket, it is

likely to be elected. Cleveland will, I suspect, be weakest at the

beginning of the canvass, and gain as it proceeds.  This, with-

out having seen any indication of the reception the result has in

the public mind.



                              SPIEGEL GROVE, July 17, 1884.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--The time you name will suit us exactly,

viz., August 13 on to the end of the month, or as long as you can.

  We are now in our best looks, but if the dry weather lasts

much longer, we shall be too dusty for comfort.

  We have at home Rutherford and Scott and Fanny. Our

niece, Miss Cook, is now one of the family. She caught a

typhoid fever the last of May, and now, in the seventh week (!),

is still in her room, but will be out in a few days. The time of

contagion, or infection, has long since passed, and no one else

has shown symptoms of the disease.  She got it in Philadelphia.

  We now have three visitors--ladies--all of whom leave in a

few days. No time could be better for your visit than the

period you suggest.

  With all regard to Mrs. Force and Horton from the whole

household. I suspect Horton will find it particularly pleasant

here, and we shall expect him to "paint the place red." That is

the genuine slang, I believe.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

    Cincinnati.



  July 21. Monday. -- Birch read Blaine's speech in June 1876

on the Mulligan letters. Blaine showed great apprehension of

disgrace and ruin when he begged the letters of Mulligan. He









             <B>NOMINATION OF CLEVELAND          157</B>



spoke of suicide, the ruin of his family, etc., etc. Nothing in the

letters seems to warrant this. There was evidently more in his

transactions with Fisher, or his other railroad transactions, than

has been made public. Otherwise his extreme agitation is un-

accountable.

  August 3. Sunday. -- With Lucy I went to Dayton to attend

the great soldiers' affair and the unveiling of the Soldiers and

Sailors' Monument. Left home Tuesday via Fostoria and Dela-

ware at 10 A. M. Met my old friend John P. Martin, of Lan-

caster, on the cars from Toledo; also A. T. Backus, Professor

McCabe and daughter, etc. Stopped an hour in Delaware with

Carrie Little, the friend of Lucy in her girlhood and the widow

of my old friend and college chum, Dr. John A. Little. Reached

Dayton at 6 P. M. We were met at the station by Major W. D.

Bickham, Honorable Lewis Gunckel, and ---. Remained two

days and three nights at Major Bickham's. A fine family. Mrs.

Bickham a noble woman. They have four boys--all indus-

trious, intelligent, and manly. Two graduates of Princeton, the

others destined to be.

  We spent one evening with the widow and daughter Kate of

my old friend Richard C. Anderson. Dined with Mr. Reynolds,

the brother of Eugene, the gallant sergeant-major of the Twenty-

third, who was killed at South Mountain.

  We were charmed with two new acquaintances, young ladies,

Eliza Irwin and Kitty Houk. Eliza is a granddaughter of Ad-

miral Schenck; Kitty is a daughter of George W. Houk.

  At Major Bickham's fine home, met Senator Sherman, Gen-

eral Hawley, Gober G. Lowe, Houk, my kinsfolk, Mrs. Garst

and Mrs. Morrison -- the first a great-granddaughter of Ezekiel

Hayes and Mrs. Morrison, a widow of her brother.

  August 10. Sunday. -- The three obstacles or dangers in our

path: I. Intemperance. 2. Illiteracy. 3. Monster accumula-

tions of wealth in a few hands.



                           SPIEGEL GROVE, August 11, 1884.

  MY DEAR MRS. BICKHAM:--Mrs. Hayes remained in Colum-

bus about a week. I came home the next day after I left Dayton.









<B>158          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



We found our niece much improved and the whole household

none the worse, perhaps the happier by reason of our absence.

This was all that was needed to make our visit with you, for us,

simply perfect. If it turns out also that you were not broken

down by the burden imposed on you, we are ready to hunt up

the white stone to mark the date as one of our selectest and

best. Dayton, [the] Soldiers' Monument, and your family and

the friends you gathered around you will always have a snug

place in our minds and hearts.

  Mrs. Hayes joins me in all regards and good wishes to you,

the major, your sister, and those noble young fellows you have

so much reason to be proud of.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. WILLIAM D. BICKHAM,

    Dayton.





  August 24.  Saturday. -- With Lucy Wednesday morning to

Lakeside, via Sandusky and steamer Ferris, to attend the Twenty-

third reunion. With General Comly, Captain Lyon, Captain

Atkinson, Lieutenant Killam, Kimberley, and others, it was an

exceedingly happy reunion of about forty to fifty of the old

Twenty-third, with their wives and children.  Sailing, social

meetings, songs, and recollections made the time pass rapidly and

pleasantly.

  Captain Lyon told his experience as a prisoner. The Rebels

tried to get the prisoners to sign a petition to President Lincoln,

to exchange man for man and release the surplus on parole. As

we held many more prisoners than the Rebels had of ours, it was

found that the effect would be to fill up the Rebel armies with

healthy men let loose by us. The officers in Libby got up a

counter petition asking Lincoln to do what the interests of the

cause required. The first was rejected with decision. The last

was signed with unanimity. Captain Lyon was appointed on a

commission to present the first named petition in Andersonville.

The result was the same there.  So the election for President in

1864 in Andersonville was almost a unanimous vote for Lincoln.









             <B>PRISON CONGRESS AT SARATOGA          159</B>



Poor fellows had to be lifted up from the ground while they

signed the petition which would strengthen their country's cause

but which sealed their own doom.





                          FREMONT, OHIO, August 27, 1884.

  MY DEAR SIR:--You are doubtless right as to the time when

the changes at T. [Toledo (?)] should be made.  The course of

events should not now be disturbed.

  Mrs. Hayes and I hope to visit Mansfield and enjoy the new

home before you return to Washington in December. We go to

our army reunion at Cumberland next week.

  Mrs. Hayes joins in kindest regards to Mrs. Sherman and

yourself.                 Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                                SPIEGEL, September 1, 1884.

  MY DARLING:--Your mother and I expect to start this after-

noon for Cumberland to attend the reunion of the Army of West

Virginia. Your mother expects to return Friday. I shall go

to Saratoga and will return about the 10th or 12th.

  We remembered the birthday of your mother (28th [of]

August) only with affection. Yours tomorrow will have the

same treatment. But then we do love you all the same--you

darling old girl of seventeen!--With love from all.

                        Affectionately,

                                                        H.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Columbus.



             SARATOGA, Tuesday morning, September 9, 1884.

  MY DARLING:--We are getting on nicely [with the prison

association meeting] in all respects. You would find life here

interesting for a few days, and with the number of acquaintances

you would meet, you would feel quite at home. The days are

hot but the nights are comfortable. Without you it is, however,









<B>160          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



a poor business. I shall push for home as soon as I can properly

leave. I now expect to leave here tomorrow (Wednesday) eve-

ning and to reach home Thursday evening.

                 With all love, affectionately,

  MRS. HAYES.



  September 12. Friday. -- Home again.  The reunion at Cum-

berland was very successful. Lucy and I enjoyed every moment

of our stay. Generals Crook, Kelley, Powell, Duval, Devol,

Enochs, and other old comrades came together with the old-time

friendship, warm and strong. A hearty welcome and greeting.

The ladies, Mrs. Lowndes, Mrs. Romain, etc., etc., added to

the charm.

  Wednesday evening, 10 P. M., left Saratoga with Rev. Dr.

Byers, General Brinkerhoff, Judge Follett and wife and boy,

Judge Pugh, [and] Mr. Patterson, of Cleveland Reformatory, --

all members of the National Prison Association--via Schenec-

tady and Buffalo. At Cleveland stopped a few hours and dined

with Colonel John Hay.

  At Saratoga had a pleasant "so-called" cottage (and all this

in the so-called "nineteenth century") at the United States Hotel;

a ride all round with Mr. Marvin; a most charming social time

with Mr. and Mrs. Round, Dr. Byers, Miss Hall, and Rev. Dr.

Lyman Abbott, at the same table, four full days at all means

[meals]. A capital circle, not to be forgotten.

  The work of the association was good. A paper on extradi-

tion. The pardoning power, punishments, the causes of crime,

and other topics were ably handled. The talk of the warden

of Sing Sing (Mr. Brush), the warden of Illinois State Prison,

at Chester, and Mr. Brockway, of Elmira, New York, were

specially notable.

  September 14. Sunday.-Dr. Mather preached his last sermon

as our pastor. He was badly treated by the scandal circulated

by a few. His "good gray head" is loved by many; by none

more than by this household. Lucy, Birch, and I with Adda

were the whole circle today. Fanny at Columbus, Scott at a









             <B>EARTHQUAKE, SEPTEMBER, 1884          161</B>



chum's near Green Spring, Rud with Webb at a camp of the

Cleveland Cavalry troop near Chautauqua.

  Our little squad remembered to talk over the battle at South

Mountain, fought on such a day as this twenty-two years ago

today.



                     SPIEGEL, FREMONT, September 14, 1884.

  MY DEAR GUY:--I have just returned from a two-weeks

trip East--to New York, Saratoga, etc., etc.,--and find here

your very welcome letter. I am especially glad to hear that we

shall have your son so near, and that we may expect to see Mrs.

Ballinger, Bettie, at our home. I will write them today.

  My family are all in good health. Fanny will go to school

another year in Cleveland, and perhaps then go East to school

for a year or two. Scott is at an academy near by us. All the

others in business, as they were.

  Mrs. Hayes retains her usual good health. I hope to see you

here. Do not leave it out of your plans.

                          As ever,

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.



  September 16.  Tuesday. -- Our pastor leaves us tomorrow.

A good man, badly treated. An able pulpit orator, a gentleman

in the best sense, an humble and sincere Christian. I have stood

by him; helped him beyond my means. God bless him!

  September 17.  Wednesday. -- Recalled my experience in the

little brick house of Jacob Rudy at Middletown, Maryland, when

twenty-two years ago I lay wounded, listening all day and until

after dark to the sound of the battle.  "With us or with our

foes?" running through my head as a chorus to the roar of the

cannon. Often for minutes together the sound of the cannon

was as unbroken as if it were musketry.

  September 19.  Friday. -- Earthquake!     About 3:30 P. M.

Mrs. Hayes, Mrs. Keeler, et al. sitting in this room, the library,

noticed a rumble and shaking. Mrs. Hayes said it must be a

    11









<B>162          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



heavily loaded wagon on our main drive. Going into the kitchen,

Anna, spoke of "the shaking things."  Not until we heard from

the village did we understand the cause. I am not sure that I

noticed it. Looking in the cellar for a hammer, something sin-

gular struck me about that time.  I now  suspect it was the

"quake."

  September 22.  Monday.--Another great fire in Cleveland.

This evening saw the new moon over the left shoulder. Betty

Ballinger, daughter of William P. Ballinger, of Galveston, came

today with her young nephew, Guy Bryan, from Ann Arbor to

make us a short visit.  She is a charming woman.  Guy is a

natural--a born gentleman. He has the good manners of his

father and the amiable and lovable disposition of his mother.

  September 23.  Tuesday. -- We gave freedom to the slave but

it was for the good of the whole country; nay, it was for the

good of all mankind. We wiped out the line between the North

and the South for the good alike and equally of North and

South.  We blotted out the color line in all statute books for the

benefit equally of the white race and the colored race.

  September 24.  Wednesday. -- Betty Ballinger and Guy Junior

left us after a very happy time for us. All old college times and

persons talked over and particularly all recollections of my Texas

visit in 1848-9. Lucy constantly says what a fine boy Guy is;

how lovable he is. Lucy and I went with them to Toledo; rained

pitchforks.

  September 27.  Saturday. -- Had a meeting of the building

committee in the church and settled with Rev. D. D. Mather.

He has paid out all moneys collected by him as treasurer of the

building fund. We now owe [more than seven thousand dollars].

  Due the church on the subscription about twenty-nine hundred

dollars of which three or four hundred may prove uncollectible.

  General Robinson speaks here today for the Republican cause.

Mr. Blaine stops here fifteen minutes Monday.  His tour is too

hasty to do much except to increase the interest in the election

and thus secure a full vote. This however is not needed in a

Presidential election. A full vote is a matter of course.









             <B>CAMPAIGN VISIT OF BLAINE          163</B>



                       FREMONT, OHIO, September 27, 1884.

  MY DEAR WEBB:--Your suggestion is sound.  I had arranged

with General Buckland to meet Blaine at Norwalk today. Will

do so Monday--or at Sandusky.

  Your mother will not go East with me this time. It is not

best. I expect to go Tuesday morning.

  It is a mistake for any one to urge me to be prominent in the

canvass in Ohio. The danger is the liquor question. Mr. Blaine

has a heavy load to carry in that question. Maine originated

prohibition.  Now by a three-fourths vote it is put into the con-

stitution. Mr. Blaine's influence could have changed this -- there-

fore, did it -- is the argument. One identified as I am with the

temperance reform would hurt rather than help in the present

crisis.

                          Sincerely,

                                                        H.

  WEBB C. HAYES,

    Cleveland.



  September 30. Tuesday. -- Yesterday I went with General

Buckland to meet Mr. Blaine at Norwalk. He and his son,

Walker, with Mr. Tenny, a Mr. Locke, of Madison County, and

a few others, are making a rapid canvassing tour through Ohio.

Great gatherings of people meet them at all stations. As a gen-

eral thing, Mr. Blaine does not attempt to make important argu-

ments.  The crowds gathered often are addressed in full stump

speeches by other speakers after Mr. Blaine passes on. This

"progress" will certainly aid to secure a full vote. On the whole,

I do not consider it of much importance; probably it saves ex-

pense and labor to the party.

  Mr. Blaine was cordial to me as usual. At Norwalk he in-

troduced me in a friendly way to the audience, and at my own

[town] here, was very complimentary.  He is in good voice;

does not take much pains with his speeches.  Seems desirous

simply "not to put his foot in it" by what he does say. A good

turnout at all points -- particularly at Norwalk, Sandusky, and

Fremont.

  I start today for New York on Peabody and Slater business.

Will also begin the portrait for the White House by Huntington.

  October 2, 1884.  Thursday.  Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York.

--I reached here yesterday on time, with agreeable travelling

companions, viz., Mr. Herrick, of Cleveland, Mr. Tyler, ditto.

  Peabody Board met at 12 noon. Twelve members present.

General Grant was in better health and spirits than we expected.

He was genial, talkative, and interesting. Mr. Evarts invited

me to dine with him this evening.

  I met Mr. Huntington with Dr. Curry yesterday and arranged

for a first sitting this morning and have had the sitting. I am

to be taken three-fourths length and with an overcoat on. Mr.

Huntington went with me to Rockwood's, near Seventeenth and

Broadway, and photographs were taken accordingly.

  Mr. Fish as a boy met often Albert Gallatin; heard him say

that whe he became Secretary of [the] Treasury he determined to

undo about all that Alexander Hamilton had done -- was greatly

prejudiced against Hamilton. Soon found he had better go slow,

and, at the end of thirteen years, left Hamilton's work almost

entirely undisturbed; convinced of the great ability and wisdom

of Hamilton. Gallatin talked of Washington with great respect;

yielded him credit for his great things--not an admirer; said

Jefferson was fifty years in advance of his time and associates.

When he had any important writing to do always wanted Madi-

son's aid.

  Mr. Huntington was with Morse, a portrait painter, learning

his profession, when Morse was in the first steps of the inven-

tion of his recording telegraph. Morse had his pupils as his

witnesses; had them learn the steps made -- the details of his

machines and work.

  Both Morse and Henry were conscientious in their rival claims;

both right; both embittered.  Morse, practical and successful.

got the popular fame.



                     NEW YORK, October 2, 1884, 8 A. M.

  MY DARLING:--I reached New York on time -- about 10:20

A. M. yesterday after a very agreeable trip. Mr. Herrick, where









             <B>PORTRAIT FOR WHITE HOUSE          165</B>



Fanny attended a soiree, was my special travelling companion,

but there were a number of nice people among the passengers

with whom I made or had some acquaintance.

  All here regret especially your absence. Only five ladies at

the pleasant banquet last night: Mrs. Fish, Mrs. Governor

[General] Porter, who reminds me of Mrs. June, Mrs. Lyman,

Mrs. Curry, and my comrade for the feast, Miss Mary Evarts.

Thirteen gentlemen in all--and the most sensible and enjoyable

banquet I have attended yet.

  General Grant walks with a cane--is probably permanently

crippled,--appears very well, and in the best of temper. He

told good things and delighted us all. I sat next to Mrs. Fish

and got more enjoyment from her conversation and especially

that of Mr. Fish, than ever before.

  I called at Mead's new home.  It is marvellous what a con-

venient, spacious, and homelike place is built on seventeen feet

width of ground.

  I called on Huntington and am to have my first sitting for a

sketch this morning.

                   With all affection, your

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.





  October 3.  Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York. -- Yesterday the

Peabody Board closed its session. It was voted to cut Mississippi

off from the Peabody aid to education because that State refuses

to pay to the Peabody Fund what is due on bonds held by the

board.  Mr. Evarts and I voted against this. We held that the

cause of education ought not to suffer for the lack of principle

of the Legislature. "Educate the children," I said, "and the

State will pay its debts." I called attention to the amount paid

for student aid, viz., two hundred per year. My resolution to

look into this was voted. The amount should be greatly reduced.

  The Slater Board met at 52 William Street, the office of Mr.

Jesup, at 3 P. M. I gave a short address on Mr. Slater. Dr.

Haygood's report of the first year's work is most encouraging

and satisfactory. All the members of the board expressed de-









<B>166          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



cided and warm approval. Mr. Phillips Brooks has signified his

acceptance of the place on the board originally conferred by Mr.

Slater and will attend the meeting of the executive committee

at my room today.

  October 4. -- My birthday -- sixty-two years old. In good

health, with spirits youthful and a good deal of physical en-

durance.

  Last evening, after a good meeting of the Slater Board in

the forenoon, I called with Charles L. Mead at Whitelaw Reid's

room in [the] Tribune building; not in; then on Halstead at

room of New York Extra [a Blaine campaign paper]. He was

looking finely. Talked rapidly in his own old way of Blaine and

his wonderful faculty of remembering and recalling the details of

Irish scenery and families; how he talked to four Irishmen as

if their genealogical trees had been his special study; of his own

blunder in forgetting to give the Irishman Shields the credit of

defeating Stonewall Jackson at Winchester in 1862; of the good

milk eating-house where he got his fresh milk and apple-pie. He

showed it to Mead and me and we did likewise.

  Our morning meeting of the Slater Board was attended by

Gilman, Dodge, Slater, Phillips Brooks, the Chief Justice, and

myself. An interesting meeting. The feeling strong that we

ought to have all the time of Dr. Haygood. There will be some

uneasiness unless we get it. Two plans were suggested. To

give Dr. Haygood an increased salary, five thousand dollars, and

travelling expenses, or hire for him an assistant at one thousand

to one thousand five hundred dollars.  It was finally resolved

to authorize the president to negotiate with him for his whole

time. Time of meeting changed to May -- third Wednesday,

(Fifth Avenue [Hotel] left optional with the president, also

hour of day). Mr. Dodge and others feel that Dr. Haygood

should be able to spend more time with the board and especially

more time examining industrial schools at the North and attend-

ing the schools aided by us in term time. I must bring this forc-

ibly to Dr. Haygood's attention.

  October 8.--Yesterday with Lucy to Toledo; dinner and tea

with Mr. Young. Present, Mrs. Waite (Chief Justice), Mrs.









             <B>ACTIVITY OF SLATER BOARD          167</B>



Swayne, Mrs. Young, Noah Swayne, Frank, ditto, [and] Birch-

ard.

   Rode over to the new rolling-mill--a mill to change pig iron

and old scrap iron into wrought iron bars, sheets, rods, etc., etc.,

of all sizes.  Iron for boilers to be a specialty. . . .  Seven

hundred and forty hands to be employed; three hundred cottages

to be put up. Other works will cluster around it.

   In the evening attended a meeting in the interest of a manual

training school in Toledo.

   October 9.--Afternoon, went to the county fair.  Found

General Kennedy and brought him home with us. Adda and

R. P. went with Kennedy to the meeting. General Kennedy feels

confident of a large majority for the Republican ticket next Tues-

day. I attended the call for the trustees of the Methodist Epis-

copal church at the new pastor's -- a Mr. Prentiss. We talked

over the affairs of the new edifice, heating, lighting, frescoing,

seating, etc., etc., and found that most of it must be postponed

until we can raise more money by subscription.

   October 12.  Sunday. -- Birch, Rud, and Webb at home.  Our

new minister, Mr. Prentiss, preached an earnest sermon. He

shows a social and friendly magnetism, which with his talents

in the pulpit will I hope enable him to stir the dry bones. A

revival in Fremont is the thing needed.

  General Durbin Ward called in the afternoon with Mr. Meek.

He is making campaign speeches for the Democrats. He agrees

with me that the uncertain and unknown quantities in this can-

vass are much larger than usual. More people are unattached

than ever before since the present division of parties. He looks

for a Democratic victory in Ohio, but not with entire confidence.

  October 14.  Tuesday. -- Election day.  Another perfect Octo-

ber day. I think the Republicans will win. On a full vote the

Republican majority I put at thirty thousand. From this deduct

ten to fifteen thousand Prohibition votes and ten thousand saloon

votes. Add five thousand Irish and labor votes and we have left

at least ten thousand majority. I hope for this result.









<B>168          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  October 15.  Wednesday.--The election yesterday passed off

with a fine day and full vote. The returns seem to indicate a

rousing Republican victory.

  Our County Bible Society holds its yearly meeting soon. As

one of the vice-presidents of the general society of the county,

as a non-church member, a non-professor of religion, I may say

why men of the world, friends of their country and of their race,

should support the religion of the Bible--the Christian religion.

To worship -- "the great Creator to adore" -- the wish to es-

tablish relations with the Omnipotent Power which made the

universe, and which controls it, is a deeply seated principle of

human nature. It is found among all races of men. It is well-

nigh universal. All peoples have some religion. In our day

men who cast off the Christian religion show the innate tendency

by spending time and effort in Spiritualism. If the God of the

Bible is dethroned the goddess of reason is set up. Religion al-

ways has been, always will be.  Now, the best religion the world

has ever had is the religion of Christ. A man or a community

adopting it is virtuous, prosperous, and happy.

  Byron has said, "If our God was man -- or man, God--

Christ was both"; and continuing he said, "I never arraigned

his creed, but the use--or abuse--made of it."

  What a great mistake the man makes who goes about to op-

pose this religion! What a crime, if we may judge of men's acts

by their results! Nay, what a great mistake is made by him who

does not support the religion of the Bible!

  October 17. Friday.--I have begun to read with Mrs. Her-

ron and others of the household "Miss Luddington's Sister"--a

queer story so far. Last evening Mrs. Herron called attention

to Dr. Franklin's attempt to reach perfection in virtue, and the

rules he prepared for that purpose. After some searching, we

found the account of it both in Mr. Bigelow's and in Sparks'

copy of the "Autobiography." It is curious reading. We pored

over the "Auto." with interest.

  October 18. Saturday.--I am urged by General Keifer, of

Springfield, to go as a spokesman and chairman with a Spring-









             <B>THE RELIGION OF THE BIBLE          169</B>



field delegation to meet Blaine at Indianapolis. Of course I

can't go.

  October 21. -- Rode in the afternoon with Lucy and Mrs. Her-

ron down the river on the east side to the end of the road on the

river bank.  A  charming ride.  In the evening read Punch's

tribute to Lincoln by Tom Taylor after his assassination, also

Emerson's fine talk on the same subject. A day to be marked

with a white stone.

  October 22. -- Read with Harriet Herbert Spencer on "Why

we Laugh."

  October 23.  Thursday. -- The coldest morning so far this fall.

No rain or snow during the day.  A cloudy, cold November day.

Wrote letters and attended to business. Read opening lines of

"Marmion"--"November Sky," and tribute to Pitt and Fox to

Mrs. Herron, and Herbert Spencer on "Music and its Function."

Took in all plants and apples in anticipation of [a] freezing

night.



Private and confidential.

                           FREMONT, OHIO, October 23, 1884.

  DEAR SIR: -- The alleged interview was first published in 1881,

and was explicitly denied at the time.  No such interview occurred

and no such statements were made. This denial has been pub-

lished in leading Republican journals recently in Cincinnati, New

York, and Washington.

                           Sincerely,

                                                    R. B. H.

  MR. J. E. D. WARD.



  October 26. Sunday.--I read in the Minneapolis Tribune

this morning [in] a sermon by Talmage: --

  "We have an evil that costs the nation more than a billion dol-

lars a year--to support three hundred and fifty thousand crim-

inals, thirty thousand idiots, eight hundred thousand paupers,

and bury seventy-five thousand drunkards."









<B>170          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Is it true?  Where does Mr. Talmage get his facts? Are there

trustworthy statistics showing the above? No doubt the truth

on all points is bad enough, but it is hardly credible that seventy-

five thousand drunkards die yearly in this country.

  October 27.  Monday. -- Lucy and I go to Cleveland this morn-

ing.  She will preside at the meeting of the Woman's Home

Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.  I will

attend a meeting commemorating the completion of Bishop Be-

dell's twenty-five years as bishop and will say a few words

by way of tribute to this excellent man, who has been these many

years my much valued friend.

  10 A. M.  I have just received a dispatch from Sophia Wasson

(White) that her mother is dead and will be buried tomorrow,

the 28th, at 2 P. M.  She came to Ohio with my father and

mother in 1817.  I do not know her age but suppose it to be

about eighty.  My earliest recollections are connected with her.

She remained a member of our family until after she was mar-

ried to Thomas Wasson, when she moved into his house across

the street about 1830.  I recollect her marrying well.  Mr. Was-

son said as I was going with him across the muddy street, "Rud,

look out for the mud."  She was always good to sister Fanny

and myself, so kind; a woman of strong mind; an exact mem-

ory for names, events, and dates that was simply a marvel.

  October 29. -- Dr. Haygood says [of] one hundred and thirty-

four counties [in Georgia] eighty-five adopt and enforce local

option, and [in] about twelve others, parts of counties--dis-

tricts -- exclude liquor selling.

  I attended yesterday the funeral of Mrs. Wasson.  Arcena

[Smith] Wasson was born December 7, 1797.  She died from

a fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone (the result of a fall

some six weeks ago) on Sunday [the] 26th. I rode to the ceme-

tery with Mrs. --- (nee Welch), with Miss Mendenhall as

my lady companion. Much pleasant talk of old times and of

Mrs.  Wasson.    She  was  the embodiment  of industry, hon-

esty, truthfulness, and efficiency.

  After the funeral, with Thomas F. Joy, went to the college









             <B>BISHOP BEDELL HONORED          171</B>



chapel; attended prayers. A noble sight -- six hundred to eight

hundred young people--students; spoke a word to them.

  At Cleveland (27th) was present at the celebration of the

twenty-fifth anniversary of the consecration of Bishop Bedell.

A  beautiful church and fine audience; made a short, well-re-

ceived speech. Lucy remained to take part in the meeting of

Woman's Home Missionary Society.

  From Delaware to Toledo in the evening of Tuesday; staid

at Island House 27th [28th], and at 8 A. M. home again. Found

as guests, Miss Sherman, Dr. A. G. Haygood, and Morton, the

executive clerk [during my Administration] who read the papers

and put in a scrapbook extracts for my reading that would show

the current talk, both friendly and hostile.

  Dr. Haygood came in response to my letter informing him of

the desire of the Slater [trustees] to secure his whole time for

their work. He seems to like the idea; is embarrassed by the pe-

cuniary condition of the college he is at the head of. He will

try to help them out, and if successful will come to us.
