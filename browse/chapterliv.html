   JUNE 5. Sunday. - Blaine resigns from Harrison's Cabinet.

Bad relations between Blaine and Harrison.       More  im-

portant-between Mrs. Blaine and Mrs. Harrison. Now a

fight for the nomination at the Republican National Convention

the 7th. There may be enough division and hostility to defeat

the Republicans. It clouds their prospects for the time. Prob-

ably the only chance is to drop both Blaine and Harrison and

combine on Sherman, McKinley, or  -?

  Blaine's former conduct, with this, will carry many Republi-

cans into opposition if he is nominated. Insincerity and lack

of honesty, in the opinion of many good people, will injure

Blaine if he is in the race. He is popular--very--but lacks

the confidence to command support with the thoughtful and

conservative.

  June 7.  Tuesday.-- The Blaine boom or brag is either sus-

pended or weakened by the news of last evening.

  After all their care and my care the Journal folks had in my

last sentence of Memorial [Day] address immorality instead of

immortality.

  Bellamy, in the North American Review, on the "Progress of

Nationalism," says many good things. "Millionaires and their

shadows the tramps."-Yes, pauperism is the shadow of ex-

cessive wealth.

<B>90           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Took 11 A. M. train [to Cleveland]. As we passed east of

Norwalk a heavy fall of rain near Oberlin. Soon after we

passed, the flood washed out the railroad for a quarter of a

mile. Reached Aunty Austin's, 891 Prospect, just as the rain

began. Happy meetings.

  June 8.  Wednesday. - Called on President Thwing and was

excused from attending the meeting of the board of Western

Reserve University on the 21-22d.      Called [also] on Honor-

able Amos Townsend, the secretary and active man of the Gar-

field Monument Association.  He and Edwards agreed with me

that the Republican National Convention would do well to drop

Blaine and Harrison and take up McKinley.

  Afternoon, met with the Garfield Monument Board.  Present,

Senator  Payne,  Townsend,  Parsons,  Judge  White,  General

Barnett.  All affairs in good condition; funds ample, out of

debt.  Ordered the statues to be completed; reelected the old

officers. Next with General Barnett, attended and presided at

meeting of board of Western Reserve Historical Society. Judge

Baldwin the active man. He was elected president, with other

officers. Funds in good condition. Over ten thousand dollars

in hand to fit up the fire-proof building.

  June 9.  Thursday. --Afternoon,  home  via  Lake  Shore.

Met  the  Baptist  ("bishop")  superintendent  of  this region,

also Chaplain Collins. About all I meet think it is best for the

National Convention to drop Harrison and Blaine and take up

McKinley. Senator Payne in Cleveland talked most pleasantly

of the way Southern Senators, Colquitt and others, spoke of

Hayes and the Hayes Administration.

  June 10. - Half past four P. M., telephoned from the Journal

office that Harrison was nominated on the first ballot. This is

well--perhaps the best possible--under all the circumstances.

It gives Blaine a very black eye. He came into the fight when

he was honorably bound to keep out.  He had the support of

almost all the unscrupulous bosses--Platt, Quay, Foraker,

Clarkson, etc., etc. Harrison represents the best elements of

the party. I hope McKinley has borne himself (as I am con-









             <B>RENOMINATION OF HARRISON          91</B>



fident he has) as a man of honor should. Judge Lucius B.

Otis, formerly a partner of Uncle in banking here, for thirty or

forty years a capitalist of Chicago, is visting at Aunty Miller's.

He thinks Harrison is not a popular candidate. "He is a deacon

[elder] in the Presbyterian Church. They are never liked by

the people. They are stiff, cold, distant. They are the elect of

God--by faith, not works, to be saved," etc., etc.

  June 11.--Judge Otis says the weakest point in Harrison's

canvass is the bread-and-butter brigade and the second term.

The ins are not so numerous or so active and influential as the

outs. Cleveland has something of the same weakness. His

former office-holders are pushing his campaign.

  Later.--I have read in two papers the proceedings. I am

delighted. McKinley won new laurels. His fame is purer and

brighter than ever. I have written congratulating him--"the

man with the purest fame and the most brilliant record of any

statesman in our political history."  (Quotation from my letter.)

  Afternoon, drove with Judge Otis west on pike with Mrs.

Miller. He told me General Buckland asked him if he was

satisfied as to a future life--a continuance of the personal

existence here. That he [Buckland] had studied it all he could

and the only conclusion he had reached was, "We don't know."

He was a faithful churchman, however. Judge Otis agreed

with him. Also a faithful churchman of the Episcopal Church.

  Under "the plunder law," Hedges of Tiffin signed a bond to

the State to get the money or securities the State gave to the

old Mad River Railroad for one hundred thousand dollars.

Otis saw the venerable, long-white-haired man coming out of

Rudolphus Dickinson's home. Dickinson told Otis: "The old

man who owns Tiffin thinks the bond will ruin him and offers

me as a member of the Board of Public Works one-half of all

his property if I will get him out of it. When I was a young

man beginning in Tiffin, Hedges was kind to me. I told him

to go home and borrow no trouble on account of that liability;

that if it ever troubled him, to come to me again and I would

help him." "Of course," said the judge, "it never came up

against him. And so it is; men are often worried and suffer









<B>92           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



from imaginary dangers. A peril is half conquered the moment

it is boldly and resolutely met. I cut off tobacco and smoking

after using it thirty years. I kept my box in my pocket full

of tobacco, and a fine cigar in sight in my library. If they were

a mile off, I never would have got rid of the hunger for them."

Always face a difficulty or danger and it gives way.

  Otis dined with us. Also Miller and his wife. Webb came

in while we were at dinner from the Republican Convention at

Minneapolis. McKinley was superb and gained new laurels.

  June 15.  Wednesday. -  Finished reading Tourgee's "Mur-

vale Eastman." It is his best book; puts the question of our

time admirably.  He has hit the nail on the head.  More that

is good and less that hurts than in any book I have seen on the

question.





                                    SPIEGEL, June 15, 1892.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - My notice, just received from Captain

Hunter, names Captain (Judge) Lemmon, of Clyde, as chairman

of the commitee on tribute to General Buckland. He has time-

I have not -and of course will prepare the sketch of the gen-

eral.  He is accurate and well supplied with the needed ma-

terials. Please support him for the authorship.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.





  June 17. Friday. - Evening, called on our Member of Con-

gress, Colonel Haynes. The Democratic Convention at Chicago

next week empties Washington of the members of the House.

The colonel prefers Gorman to Cleveland. Cleveland is sup-

ported by the Mugwumps and his ex-office-holders.  Neither of

these forces are favorites. Yet with cash - the cash of Whitney,

ex-Secretary of Navy - Cleveland has the large majority of dele-

gates.  Will his many adversaries, with the help of Tammany,

and the threat of the loss of New York, be able to beat him?









             <B>UNIVERSITY ACTIVITIES          93</B>



  June 18.  Saturday.- I go to Delaware this morning.  Will

visit the three colleges, Wesleyan, State, and Kenyon before I

return. Fifty years ago at Kenyon I graduated.

  Met by the student at President Bashford's at the Delaware

station and taken to the pleasant home.  Welcomed by Mrs.

Bashford.

  Delaware, June 19.  Sunday.-With  Mr.  Gray  attended

church. President Bashford preached, accepting fully the theory

of evolution, and suggesting with some confidence a higher "sin-

less being" on this earth as the successor of man; supporting

the idea by Scripture, science, analogies.

  Delaware, June 20. Monday.--Saturday evening I took tea

with the saint-like, venerable, wonderfully attractive President

Merrick. He is feeble--ready to be translated. He said his

father in Wilmington, Vermont, as a young man was a bosom

friend of my father; that visiting at Delaware in his old age,

he returned from one of his walks in a state of excitement:

"I have found my long-lost friend--Rutherford Hayes. His

name is on a gravestone in the old graveyard. Can you tell me

about him. After I left Vermont I heard he went West. But

I never learned the place." He soon ascertained that his friend

was indeed found.

  Attended  meeting  of  the  board.  A  full, good  meeting.

Vexed that formal documents, deeds, etc., etc., were read at

full length. I expressed it and was relieved by a change of

reading, etc.

  Columbus,  June  22.  Wednesday. -Attended  meeting  of

trustees of Ohio State University, yesterday and today. Elected

H. C. Adams director of [the] industrial college.  Have great

hopes of him. Not a certainty.

  Evening to Gambier. Met by President Sterling. Found Mr.

Southworth, of Salem, at the president's. He delivered the Phi

Beta Kappa oration Wednesday evening. Met Colonel Jacobs

of Baltimore, an L. L. [Loyal Legion man].

  June 23.  Thursday. -Commencement.         The  two  bishops,

Vincent and Leonard, Mr. Delano, and others on the stand.

Three orations by  seniors; two  of them by  Buttles-now









<B>94           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Buttolph! The address to the Societies by Judge Ricks was

good. I was most heartily greeted and made a scattering talk

of fifteen minutes.

  June 27. Monday.- To Cleveland to preside over Loyal

Legion banquet at the Hollenden. Spoke acceptably. A very

good time.

  June 30. Thursday. - Webb came during the night. He

was pleased with my speech. I am more gratified by pleasing

the children and a few near friends and relatives than by any

other thing connected with my public appearances.

  July 4. Monday. -Morning, fireworks by Webb, Rud, and

the two boys [Birchard's]. [Young] Webb soon recovered from

his alarm and enjoyed them.  .  .  . Scott came before noon,

looking happy, handsome, and healthy, polite and gentlemanly.

Proud of him. The little fellows good and happy. One of the

best of the Fourths. Weather cool, bracing, bright, perfect.

  July 6.  Wednesday.-- To  Columbus.  Afternoon, met the

State University board and in the evening the Experiment Sta-

tion board. After a friendly interview it was agreed to ap-

point a committee of each party to deal with all questions as

to personal property.  On our side, Mr. Wing and Professor

Hunt. As to the large claims for buildings and improvements

of real estate, that was passed--practically to be left with the

Legislature.

  July 7. Thursday.--Morning, called at [the] governor's of-

fice.  Visited the university.  Looked over buildings.  After-

noon, to Cleveland.

  The most important matter as to the university was to get

the opinions of Godfrey, Dr. Schueller, Wing, and Chamberlain

in favor of Dr. Washington Gladden for president. I wrote to

Dr. Gladden that five were earnestly for his election and for an

act allowing us to pay him a fair salary, and our belief that

the other members of the board, Massie and Alexander, would

concur with us.

  Agreed with Colonel Brigham to go with him to the [National]

Grange meeting at Chautauqua in August.









             <B>POLITICS AND PROHIBITION          95</B>



  July 8. Friday.--At 891 Prospect. Only Miss Avery at

home. Read to her Edwin Arnold's "Death and Afterwards,"

also bought and read Foran's "The Other Side,"--a fair

presentation of the labor question from the side of the working-

man.

  July 10. Sunday.--I have finished my correspondence and

must now prepare two speeches--one a soldier talk for the

Chautauqua at South Framingham, July 25, and one for Chau-

tauqua Lake to the Grangers, August 19. The first will be easy.

The next will be to show the value to farmers of "the higher

(highest) education" and of manual training.

  July 14.  Thursday. - President Bashford writes another ar-

ticle in favor of prohibition as a remedy for intemperance. He

thinks too that prohibition must have a party behind it--that

is, in favor of it - for its enforcement.  He fails to see either

that a party for implies a party against; or he fails to see that

a party against prohibition means a failure to enforce. No grand

jury will indict where there is a party against it, or if by chance

twelve out of one hundred and twenty are for [against] the in-

dictment, it is certain that one in the twelve will refuse to

convict.

  July 15. Friday. - One of the autograph fiends wrote me

for a sketch of my life in my own handwriting.  I wrote a

short note rebuking him. He replied much hurt; sent a sketch

of Mr. Endicott, of Salem.  I relented and replied:-

  MY DEAR Boy:-- You made a mistake in asking a busy man

to write you a sketch of his life, no matter how short. I

made a mistake in reminding you of it in a way to wound your

feelings. I want to relieve you and to correct my mistake.

  The enclosed compliance with your request will, I trust, do

this and leave us friends.

                With all regards. Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  ALBERT ENGLISH,

    Allegheny, Pennsylvania.









<B>96           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  The sketch is: - Rutherford Birchard Hayes was born in Dela-

ware, Ohio, October 4, 1822. He began to prepare for college

in the law office of Sherman Finch in Delaware in 1834. He

continued his preparatory studies at Norwalk Seminary 1835-

 1836, and at the school of Isaac Webb in Middletown, Con-

necticut, 1837-1838 and entered Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio,

in October or November 1838. He graduated August 3, 1842.

He began the study of law at Columbus, Ohio, October 1842,

and completed his preparation for the bar at the law school

of Harvard College 1843-1845 under Justice Story and Profes-

sor Greenleaf.  He was admitted to the [bar] at Marietta, Ohio,

in 1845--March 10--and began the practice of his profession

at Lower Sandusky, Ohio (now Fremont, Ohio). In 1846 he

formed a partnership with Ralph P. Buckland, afterwards a

distinguished general in the War for the Union, and a public

man of probity and influence. In 1849 he removed to Cincinnati

where he resided until 1873, when he returned to his old home

at Fremont, Ohio, where he still lives.

  He served in the War of the Rebellion from the beginning

to the end; saw much severe service; was five times wounded-

twice badly; and had four horses shot under him. He began

as a private in the Burnet Rifles and became captain, major,

lieutenant-colonel, colonel, brigadier-general, and major-general

(by brevet).

  He was ten times a candidate for civil offices; was elected

eight times; twice defeated, and twice chosen by one majority.

  He is President of the Regimental Association of the Twenty-

third O. V. V. I.; of the Society of the Army of West Vir-

ginia; of the Maumee Valley Historical and Monumental So-

ciety; of the Garfield Monumental Society; of the Slater Educa-

tion Fund for Freedmen; of the National Prison Association;

Commander-in-Chief of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion

of the United States, and of other organizations. He is a mem-

ber of the board of trustees of the Peabody Education Fund;

of the Ohio State University; of the Western Reserve Uni-

versity; of the Ohio Wesleyan University, and of other educa-

tional institutions and benevolent and charitable societies.









             <B>EPITOME OF CAREER          97</B>



  The most interesting fact in his life is his marriage December

30, 1852, to Lucy Ware Webb at Cincinnati, Ohio. She died

June 25, 1889, leaving five children - four sons and one daughter

- all now grown to maturity. Her motto was the Golden Rule,

and with wonderfully attractive powers her life was an illus-

trious example of the rule.

  He serves his party best who serves his country best.

  July 17. Sunday.-Met at church Anthony Comstock,

ardent, energetic, and sincere in his work [as secretary of the

New York Society for the Suppression of Vice].

  I go tomorrow to Cleveland to perfect loan; then to visit Mr.

Evarts at Windsor; then 24-25 at South Framingham  Chau-

tauqua; then to Brattleboro, 26-31.

  Anthony Comstock preached in the Presbyterian church today.

He gave in glowing words my action in refusing pardon to a

convict who used the mails to scatter obscene matter, the place

[credit] of saving its [his society's] influence. He also spoke

of Mrs. Hayes in the White House.



                    BRATTLEBORO, VERMONT, July 22, 1892.

  MY DEAR FANNY:- After hearing the awful tragedy in Mr.

Evarts' family, I changed direction and came to this lovely

town.  All friends here are well as usual..  .  .  The old

home of our blacksmith ancestor is as fine as need be-much

improved.

  Mrs. Bigelow has regained her cheerfulness and never looked

better.  Charlotte DeWitt is in her usual health and is in good

relations with her daughters-in-law.

  I go tomorrow (Saturday) to South Framingham; expecting

to reach there about 4 P. M. and to stay there Sunday and

Monday, returning here to visit Wilmington (Mother's home)

and Dummerston and spend one night in Grandfather's home

here.

  The Hay family of Cleveland were with me to this place.

They have a summer home in New Hampshire, where they will

remain two months.

   7 H.D.









<B>98           RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  My aim will be to reach home Monday morning, August I.

                       With all love,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Fremont.



  August 2. -A perfect day for the celebration of the defense

of Fort Stephenson.

  All passed off well. General Force and [the] Hon. [Mr.]

Griffith, [and] Rev. Mr. Hutsinspiller drove with me in the pro-

cession. The Sixteenth Regiment looked well under Colonel

Bunker. The meeting at the park was perhaps as large as any

ever held there. Presiding, I made an unambitious talk on the

battles fought near here - Wayne's victory in 1794, Harrison's

in 1813 at Meigs, Perry's on Lake Erie, etc. Rev. Hutsinspiller

spoke of the inspiring heroism of Croghan (a word he failed

to pronounce correctly).

  August 3. Wednesday. - All day engaged in correspondence,

etc., etc.  Huntington came in the morning.       John Mitchell

here also--a fine, promising young fellow.  Birch, Mary, and

their boys make Spiegel unusually happy.

  August 6. Saturday.- Last evening attended for the first

time the meeting of the Union Veterans' Union. About twenty

present. Rather more life and comradeship than I looked for.

They are the battle comrades, who have seen service--the

men of Port Hudson, or under Rosecrans.





           SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, August 6, 1892.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Your interesting letter of the 5th presents

a record of service, sacrifice, and suffering of which you may

well be proud, and which entitles you to the gratitude of all

patriotic citizens.

  It entitles you also to perfect frankness. A roll of a thousand

old soldiers must have present efficiency, energy, devotion, de-

voutness, and the highest ability to do their souls good. Your









             <B>DEATH OF THOMAS C. JONES          99</B>



letter does not touch this vital question, and I have no personal

knowledge which warrants me to speak in regard to it.

              With all good wishes. Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  REVEREND THOMAS J. SHEPPARD.





  August 7. Sunday.--Mr. Albritton referred to dancing, at-

tending clubs, etc., etc., as sins to be avoided. Too many things

innocent in themselves if innocently indulged are classed as sins.

The envies, the slanders, the avarice, the meannesses, the ill-

natured gossip of church members, are passed by.

  August 12. Friday. - Laura and [I] drove perhaps an hour.

It is a refreshing experience, these good talks and walks with

the bright and thoughtful niece, the darling of these fifty years.

  August 14.  Sunday.-Mr.  Albritton preached on immor-

tality. Read Emerson's "Life"; his house burning, the fine let-

ters to his friends who rebuilt it,--sitting with Webb and

Laura under the old oak in front of the house.

  August 15.  Monday.--I go with Laura this morning 7:30

train via Fostoria - I to Delaware, she to Columbus.

  I go to attend the funeral of my friend of many years, Judge

Thomas C. Jones. He was a man of talents, original, a keen

observer, a staunch Whig and Republican, a strenuous sup

porter of me and my Administration. A sound lawyer, a suc-

cessful, upright, useful man;  a leader in agriculture also; a

forcible writer; known widely and favorably; one of my earliest

and truest friends. Age seventy-six. So the end draws nearer.

He was an Episcopalian in church relations. Has a fine family.

I shall always miss him. He was nearer to me than any other

friend of boyhood remaining in Delaware. A thinker and

close observer, he was  always interesting and  wise.        Hail!

Farewell!

  August 23.  Tuesday.--At Spiegel after a week's absence.

I find here, just returned from Norwalk, Birchard, Mary, and

the boys. We returned last evening. Birch and I called at









<B>100          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Bristol's, Keeler's, and Miller's.  At Miller's met Walter Sher-

man and his bride. She is attractive; tall, graceful, with an

intelligent, alive, and friendly face and expression; more

beautiful than I expected to find her. A prize. Learned that

Fanny is in New York at Mrs. Dillenback's and may be home

in a few days.

  The diary of my absence is in brief [somewhat condensed]

as follows:--After the funeral at Delaware, Monday 15th, to

Columbus where I spent the night. Reached Cleveland Tuesday

afternoon. Thursday, to Chautauqua with Colonel J. H. Brigham,

Worthy Master of the National Grange, or Patrons of Hus-

bandry.  Reached Chautauqua about dark; not a favorable way

to get a first impression. Evening, was introduced to the as-

sembly - a  musicale.   Received  Chautauqua  salute - waving

of handkerchiefs. An immense congregation, of ladies mainly.

  Friday, [I] presided over the New York State Grange [and]

made my talk on the "Higher Education for All," [which] went

off well ; - reply to the Grange resolutions for a separate agri-

cultural and mechanical school.

  Saturday, a magnificent G. A. R. occasion. My speech was

a good deal more than well received. All sorts of good words

about it from all sorts of people.  A  great audience; capital

singing led by Mr. Excell, of Chicago.

  Sunday, with Dr. Pliny H. Hayes, of Buffalo, and his wife

to church in the amphitheatre (280 [feet] by 150), said to

seat seven thousand; excellently fitted for its purpose.  [We

heard] Mr. Gunsaulus, of Chicago, an orator. "King of Kings."

Dined with Dr. Flood in his pleasant cottage facing the lake.

He is a candidate for Congress in the Erie District against a

man of coarse ways (Sibley), the nominee of Prohibition, Peo-

ple's Party, and the Democrats.

  August 25.  Thursday. - On 9 o'clock train to preside at the

meeting of the Maumee Valley Monumental Association, meet-

ing in Memorial Hall, Toledo. Found there Samuel M. Young,

Colonel D. W. H. Howard, ex-Mayor Hamilton, [the] Hon.

[Mr.] Griffin, Mr. Tyler, of Defiance or Napoleon, Mr. Mitchell,

of Maumee, Judge Dunlap, A. A. Graham, of the State His-









             <B>ADDRESSES AT CHAUTAUQUA          101</B>



torical Society,  [and]  President  Thompson,  of Westerville.

After a rapid dispatch of business, returned.

  August 26.  Friday.- Governor Gordon [of Georgia] is re-

ported by W. A. Duncan, secretary of Chautauqua of Syracuse,

to have said repeatedly in the presence of large numbers that

when President Hayes dies Southern cities will build monu-

ments to him, etc., etc.

  The corner-stone of the sentiment of comradeship is the

principle, the idea, of equal human rights as taught by Christ

in the Sermon on the Mount and repeated by the Fathers in

the Declaration of Independence.

  At 7 P. M. Fanny, the darling, came from her trip--Adiron-

dacks, New York, etc., etc. She was in a collision at Pitts-

burgh.   Many--indeed  all but her--were injured more  or

less.  She is looking her finest, happy and spirited.  It is a

happiness to have her at home again.

  August 29. - I go today [with Fanny to Lakeside] to the

Twenty-third Reunion. I want to be the first there. We must

shake hands oftener, and with more warmth, as our numbers

grow less.            The reunion was altogether a happy time.

  September 2.  Friday. - I am in doubt as to going to Wash-

ington to the G. A. R. encampment.       My  troubles from the

grippe and the poisoning make me uncomfortable at strange

hotels. As yet I have no other arrangement for quarters. The

invitation of the Kanawha Division would take me into the

crowds.  Mr. Stead, of Washington, invites me to be his guest

with General Force and other friends of his.

  Evening at Keeler's and meditation on my speech at the Con-

ference of Charities and Correction at Cleveland.  I will set

forth ex tempore the different subjects included in the work

the conference looks after, and then a few words on prisons,

as a specialty that Cleveland may well look after.

  September 3.  Saturday.-Am clearing out the woods south

of the house, the underbrush and smaller trees of large kinds

of trees. Took no ride this afternoon; gave myself the luxury

of working in the grove, opening, clearing up, etc.









<B>102          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  September 4. Sunday.--Alone with Fanny in the house.

Old Spiegel ours without interruption. Fanny and I get better

acquainted in these periods of "all to ourselves." She is sweet,

kind, thoughtful, original, sound of judgment, and interesting.

How she adds to my happiness! Without her life would be

doleful enough.

  In the evening we attended a lecture by [the] Rev. [Mr.]

Fitch, a missionary  for  twenty  years  to  China--the  hus-

band of our bright cousin, Mary McLelland. She is far the

most interesting of the two. He is a Presbyterian. He had a

good audience in our Methodist church. He spoke of the three

hundred millions of people in China. Twelve million a year

die in ignorance of the Bible--one million a month perishing

without salvation!    This to me  seems monstrous.       God, the

Father of all, God, who is love, dooms millions of his creatures

to eternal torment! This he did not say, but, of course, it is

implied in what he did say. He gave very few facts, nothing

new, and did it in a quiet, modest way, without egotism or

pretension. One thinks well of his character but has a poor

opinion of his ability and intelligence. He to bring a new

religion to a polite and cultured people!

  At the close of my seventieth year, I join the Chautauqua

class of 1896--not at all confident that I shall live to complete

it, but with two notions in my thinking about it. It may be

useful as an example to others. Let education continue to the

end of life. I find I gain by practice in writing the remarks

and speeches I am constantly making.

  I was awake more than usual last night and soon found

myself composing semihumorous speeches. Excellent President

is easily "nicked" into ex-President.

  Of the four respectable gentlemen, now supported by the

various political parties, two- the candidates of the third and

fourth parties--General Weaver and General Bidwell, both

would give all of their old shoes and boots to take the requisite

preliminary step to becoming an ex-President. While one and

two wish equally to (for the present) avoid it. One and two

are agreed that the true issue is the tariff. One is for protec-

tion, the other for a revenue tariff.  Weaver  is for "more









             <B>LIBERAL RELIGIOUS ATTITUDE          103</B>



money"; he would fill all pockets. One and two think well of

"more money," but they both want it good money-the  in-

trinsic money of the world. Good money cannot be too abundant;

but irredeemable money, "wild-cat money," the more you have,

the worse the financial condition of the country. Bidwell is

for prohibition, national and state, perhaps also local. But the

only practicable and safe prohibition is self-prohibition.  This

is golden. It may be this is Dr. Keely's secret; hence he says

it is of gold!



Strictly private and confidential.

        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, September 5, 1892.

  MY DEAR COMRADE:--I do not want this note to be seen by

anyone but yourself. It is for your eye alone. No one knows

that I write it.

  I do not know the situation as you do, but it seems to me

that the public opinion of Cleveland is against placing the

monument on the Square in the place of the Perry monument.

The Perry monument should not be removed. Its right to re-

main is sacred. Take time by the forelock. Consult nobody

but your wife.  Write a short note to the public.  In one

sentence refer to your judgment in favor of the Square, and

to the decisions of the courts sustaining your legal right. Then

in another sentence say that in deference to public opinion you

will cheerfully cooperate in the selection of another site.

  Excuse this from your old friend and comrade. Act promptly

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  COMRADE JAMES HAYR,

    Cleveland.



  September 8.--Finished remarks for the Conference of

Charities and Correction next week at Cleveland.        [I] try to

show that the citizens must stand [by], aid, [and] inform pub-

lic officers in their duties with respect to the dependent, de-

fective, and criminal members of society.









<B>104          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  September 9. Friday.- Drove P. M. to John Fitch's and

brought Mary McLelland Fitch down to her lecture in the

Presbyterian church, -her farewell to her friends before going

to China again, after twenty years there as a missionary. How

hopeless the work seems! But to her it is duty and happiness-

and this with zeal and devotion. Therefore it is well with her!

  September 11. Sunday. - Evening over to Dr. Stilwell's and

read him my little speech from printed slips. He said it was

the best speech I ever made. It was in the line of his benevolent

nature and hence its excellence.

  Cleveland, September 13. - Called A. M. at the Forest City

House and met there Mr. Byers, secretary of the State Board

of Charities, and soon after General Brinkerhoff, the president

of the Ohio State Conference of Charities and Correction, Dr.

Avery, and others.

  In the evening in the rain, at the Y. M. C. A. building. A

fair meeting, a good meeting, considering the weather. Got off

my little speech tolerably. Dr. Avery made an excellent annual

address. The mayor's welcome was hearty and in good taste.

A hearty hand-shaking at the close of the meeting.

  September 14.  Wednesday.-At  9 A.  M. met in the as-

sembly room of the Y. M. C. A., Dr. Avery presiding. Made

a motion raising a committee to get rid of repeated commit-

ments of the same old misdemeanants.  Excellent papers by

Alexander Johnson and others.

  September 15.-Thursday.- The  question as to going to

Washington is now in my thoughts. It is probable I will go

via Wheeling and Lake Erie to Wheeling; thence to Washing-

ton after a night's rest in Wheeling.    Spent the day getting

ready, writing to friends, etc. I go not for pleasure. It will

be sad enough in some respects. In Washington without Lucy!

This is the only time I have visited the city since the end of

my term, almost twelve years ago. Mrs. Harrison seems to be

near death's door. But the good and much loved comrades

of the Army of West Virginia, of the "Old Kanawha Divi-

sion," expect me and urge it [my going].









             <B>CAPACITY FOR SELF-IMPROVEMENT          105</B>



  In speaking I must give short talks on some distinct topic

of the war; as, the value of manhood-better than learning,

talents, ancestry, social standing, and wealth, all combined; the

rights and interests of men--the plain people; or what Europe,

the world, thinks of us, our influence in the family of nations;

or pensions; or our leaders, Lincoln and Grant.

  September 16. Friday.--The best idea I recall, the result

of my almost seventy years of experience, is the capacity of

men and women for self-improvement. Shakespeare says: "By

use (habit) we can almost change the stamp of nature."<B>*</B> Be-

ginning early, the young can train themselves to good disposi-

tions, to good minds, to steady nerves, to courage, to self-con-

trol, and to all the virtues and graces of mind and body. How

vast, how important!

  I have a desire, not intense but growing, to live to seventy.

I now feel as if I could leave this sphere willingly after that

day, [the] 4th [of] October next--two weeks and four days.

  Reached Wheeling about 5 P. M. Was met at the station

by Colonel Cochran who took my satchel and walked with me

to the McClure House. The colonel and a consul under Cleve-

land to Japan took tea with me. In the evening a number of

West Virginia friends called and made the evening very agree-

able,-Colonel Thayer Melvin, Mr. A. W. Campbell, recently

from Europe, Captain Dovener, candidate for Congress, Re-

publican.

  September 17. Saturday.- Fine weather. An early break-

fast. Got off about half past eight. The cars crowded with old

soldiers. On being found out, hand-shaking with them and their

wives and young people began and continued the next four or

five days. Heavy train behind time. Scott, from Cincinnati,

found me soon after starting from Wheeling. A fine son he

is. Reached Washington about 9 P. M. Recognized by a police-

man in the crowd who showed me to a hack and told me how

to get my trunk to my host's house. (Robert Stead.)

<B>106          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Was soon comfortably at home with Mr. and Mrs. Stead.

She is a niece of my friend General Force, and I could not

have fallen into better hands.  No fuss, no fidgets, but a care-

ful regard for all my needs.

  September 18.  Sunday. - A fine day.  At about 10:40 A. M.

with my large fine boy, Scott R., went to our old church, the

Foundry, corner [of] Fourteenth and H. As we entered, I told

the usher who I was, and he put me in the pew Lucy and I oc-

cupied during our four years in the White House. I soon was

recognized by a gentleman in the pew before me, Rev. Dr. -,

editor of the new Methodist organ in Washington.  The clergy-

man of the church is Rev. Oliver Brown.

  September 19. Monday.--With Webb, Bottsford, Captain

McKee, Adjutant-General Williams, and others, went over to

Arlington and inaugurated [the] monument to General Crook.

  Evening, met Colonel Nicholson, General Hawley, and a host

of Loyal Legion friends at the Army and Navy Club. Mr.

Stead and General Force with me.

  September 20.  Tuesday.-- The day of the great parade.  I

had tramped afoot with my comrades in post duties at home,

at State Encampments, and at the National Encampment in

Detroit. It struck me as the thing to do to follow these prece-

dents at Washington. The people looking on and the com-

rades approved by applause in a very gratifying way. Nothing

of the sort could have been better than the demonstration on

Fifteenth Street- Treasury on one side, Riggs House on the

other- and as I approached the stand, Senator Hawley led

in the cheering. It was enough to stir the blood of the coldest and

oldest.

  Evening dined at Army and Navy Club, meeting at table

General Schofield, Vice-President Morton, Senators Manderson,

Hawley, and other notabilities of the army and navy gathered

to meet me. After dinner a general hand-shaking.

  September 21. Wednesday. - Began to rain. The encamp-

ment met in the hall, Fifteenth Street, near southeast corner, and

Pennsylvania Avenue. All agreeable. I sat next the aisle, be-

hind [Isaac F.] Mack, the Commander, next to Squires of To-









             <B>GRAND ARMY AT WASHINGTON          107</B>



ledo.  When Past Commander ------ moved resolutions of sym-

pathy with President and Mrs. Harrison, [and] I rose promptly

to second it [them], there broke out enthusiastic and general

cheering which lasted a long time. When it ceased--in the

language of the newspapers--I "simply said, 'I second the

resolution.'" When I took my seat the applause was renewed.

  In the evening, Tuesday evening, was the meeting of the

Army of West Virginia in the Grant [great] tent. Colonel

Lang engineered it. General Bukey was secretary. General

Rosecrans, Governor Pierrepont, General Powell, and others

spoke, and I presided. The event of the evening was the going

out of the electric lights leaving us in total darkness. But the

result was typical of the good order which prevailed through-

out the whole encampment. The strange thing occurred--per-

fect order, and we went on with the speeches and business of

the society, elected officers, passed resolutions, and quietly ad-

journed, the great audience having no noise or confusion, ex-

cept the usual applause when good things were said. When

General Rosecrans was speaking, some one said, "We would

like to see his face." I lighted a match and held it near his

face. This was greeted with great applause, or rather, the old

veteran was heartily applauded.

  Wednesday evening dined again at the club.

  September 22.  Thursday.- Still raining heavily.  I took a

carriage and called at the Lucy Hayes Deaconess Home, first

of all, and found it in every way interesting and creditable.

The lady in charge and her husband, Rev. -, were very

hearty, intelligent, and friendly.  Next  I called on my old

orderly of the war and steward in the White House, William

T. Crump, at his plain but clean and orderly hotel. He is loyal

to Lucy and myself to the last syllable. Then on Mrs. Clare

H. Mohun, in Georgetown. An exceedingly agreeable lady, a

firm friend of Lucy.

  Afternoon, went to the meeting, the national meeting, of the

U. V. U. (Union Veterans' Union). Sat with the Ohio men.

Soon recognized and cheered warmly. Responded in a few

words; well received.









<B>108          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Evening at the Washington reception to the G. A. R., in the

noble hall of the Pension Department--one of the finest,

largest, and most convenient halls for such a meeting to be

found  anywhere.    With  the  Vice-President,  Palmer,  Com-

mander-in-Chief of G. A. R., and the Cabinet- Foster (J. W.),

Wanamaker, Rusk, etc.--(Foster and Wanamaker  escorting

me) marched down into the hall from the gallery and took

places on the stand. Vice-President Morton read a short and

appropriate address. Palmer spoke warmly and in an oratorical

vein. This was the whole programme, but the multitude called

vigorously "Hayes," "Hayes," and Past Commander and ex-

Commander Burdette presented me. The cheering seemed uni-

versal, beyond anything else of the kind that evening. I spoke

briefly--the idea being, the growth, splendor, and prestige of

the city of Washington is typical of the great results of the

Union triumph in 1861-5. Well received.

  Home to the most agreeable hospitality of Robert and Mrs.

Stead about 10:40, under the kind and thoughtful guidance of

Colonel Nicholson.

  My  lady friend at the refreshment table was an agreeable

lady, in mourning for her father, Miss Martha H. Scott, daugh-

ter of Colonel Scott of the army, in charge, until his death, of

the War Records.

  Governor and Senator Hawley specially attentive and cour-

teous to me.     [So also]  Colonel  Nicholson,  General  Park,

Secretary of State Foster, [and] all of the attendants at the

White House.

  October 1.  Saturday.--Began  in earnest my  Chautauqua

reading. Topic Greece. Am trying to get first the geography.

Will read Byron's "Childe Harold" on Greece, "Siege of

Corinth," etc.; consult the classical dictionary; read novels and

travels; get pictures, etc., pertaining to Greece.

  October 2.  Sunday.--I have begun to read the Chautauqua

course for 1892-6. Will I keep it up? Doubtful, but I begin.

  "The Prussian needle-gun did not conquer France. It was

the German schoolmasters." But the higher education turns out

the schoolmasters. The higher education is not like money or









             <B>GRAND ARMY AT WASHINGTON          109</B>



land or other property. It cannot be monopolized where free

schools exist. It is like pure air, good pavements in the streets,

or electric lights. It benefits all who are near to it. Elementary

education, all are agreed that the state should provide for, and

probably most people agree that it should be in compulsory

schools.  Then higher education must be--colleges, universities,

and schools of specialties.



                                   SPIEGEL, October 2, 1892.

  MY DEAR COLONEL:- The Washington trip I dreaded. Was

a little under the weather with a mild grippe; couldn't but be

down thinking of Lucy, and in all directions I could see rea-

sons for not wanting to go. But I am glad I went. I enjoyed

it keenly. Speaking six or eight times, I warmed up and cast

off the cold or grippe and returned home in perfect health and

not worn-out.

  One point:  I got an invitation from a nephew of General

Force, 1208 K Street, next square east of Sherman's, a quiet

nice place.  When anybody asked where I was, my reply was,

"At a private house on K  Street.  But I am at Ohio Head-

quarters, Riggs House, in the morning." I wish you could

have been present.  It was far better in all respects than I

anticipated. No reunion has equalled it in numbers or enjoy-

ment. The papers you see have told you all about it. A few

things.  The good behavior of the affair was notable.          For

example the gas [ ?] in the great tent went out early, leaving the

Society of West Virginia in the dark. It did not cause a ripple

of disturbance,--not  a cat-call, nobody  whistled or jeered!

I introduced speaker after speaker. Applause and decent re-

marks; no intoxication whatever; attended to business; elected

officers; no need of light! When I presented General Rosecrans

with a few words of commendation, some one called "louder"

to him; he spoke in low tones. He said, "I speak as loud as I

can."  The caller said, "Well, I would like to see your face."

I called for a match, struck it and held it to his face. There was

great applause, but nothing more. Could that be beaten? And

it was typical of the good nature and good conduct of the men

and women who came together interested in the old veterans.









<B>110          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  The soldiers brought their wives and daughters in greater

numbers than ever before--vastly more.  The Washington peo-

ple did their part handsomely. The drawback was the gloom

at the White House--the absence of the President.  It was a

real calamity. The opportunity to make twenty short, fitting,

nail-on-the-head speeches to the corps meetings, army society

meetings, etc., etc., which he would have had, and which he

would have done [used] so well, was perfectly ready for him.

It would, if improved as it would have been, have sent thou-

sands home brimful of enthusiasm for him. All lost. It may

be the difference between victory and defeat. But I am stringing

this out unconscionably - whew, what a word!

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- Fanny and I go to New York, Mohonk Lake, etc.,

etc., Thursday, 6th, and I go to Chicago 18th. I am seventy

(4th) day after tomorrow.

  Second P. S. - I have just read your letter of the 26th. The

Crook business went off nicely - without the granite The strikes

did the mischief with [the] granite part. The bronze tablets

were on the ground and were regarded as good.

  The Army of West Virginia had two meetings--all good.

The tide seems to have turned my way. The Loyal Legion

part of it was excellent at the Army and Navy Club. Eleven

hundred said to be in Washington.  I did miss you.  Nichol-

son did excellently, however.

  COLONEL H. C. CORBIN.



  October 3. Monday. - Read in the evening Greece in "Cham-

bers' Encyclopaedia," also of her and her heroes in Byron's

"Siege of Corinth" and in "Childe Harold."

  October 4.  Tuesday. - My  birthday.       Seventy years old

today.  Now my life is as happy as that of people of the com-

mon standard; more so, I suspect, far more so.

  I have tried to phrase my best lesson from the observation

and experience of the seventy years.  The idea is the chief









             <B>THE LESSON OF SEVENTY YEARS          111</B>



distinction between man and the lower animals, viz., his im-

provability by self-culture. A man can by self-culture, with

care and perseverance, "almost change the stamp of nature."

He can add to his natural faculties and powers; he can supply

defects, eradicate evil tendencies, and strengthen and quicken

all good tendencies and powers. This is the vital fact in our

nature. Washington, naturally with a violent temper, by self-

culture acquired a wonderful control over this tendency. My

tendency to nervousness in my younger days, in view of the fact

of a number of near relatives on both my father's and mother's

side of the house having become insane, gave some serious un-

easiness. I made up my mind to overcome it--to maintain

steady nerves if possible under the most trying circumstances.

In the cross-examination of witnesses before a crowded court-

house--as in the Nancy Farrer case in 1850 or 1851-I soon

found I could control myself even in the worst of testing cases.

Finally, in battle.

  Once fired on by a cannon a few feet distant, breaking the

window of the car where I sat, so as to be covered with the

powder, wads, and broken glass, I did not move a particle--

not even a finger; was not in the least disturbed by shells burst-

ing near me. Recently the dentist plugging a large cavity in

a tooth said, "It will not give you much pain but it will disturb

your nerves."  I replied, "I have no nerves."  He said, "I think

I shall find some nerves." After he had worked away, pound-

ing, grinding, and filing for some time, I fell into a sweet sleep

in his hands, his working having a rather soothing effect!

  The case of the cannon fired into the car occurred as I was

going to the first opening ceremony of the great Centennial

Exposition from Buffalo direct by a new railroad to Phila-

delphia. The train was met at all stations with a welcome to

the notabilities and to the new railroad. Bands, crowds, flags,

and cannon firing.  At one place the cannon, a few feet from

the track, was to be fired just after the last car had passed.

The train stopped more suddenly than was anticipated and the

shot was fired direct into the window where I sat. The glass

cut my forehead so it bled freely. The powder and wet wads

plastered my face and eyes, etc., but I did not stir. A fellow









<B>112          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



passenger a few seats away, as the smoke cleared off, looking

at me saw I had not stirred and thought I was killed. He

came to me. I told him in the most matter-of-fact way that I

was sure I was not hurt seriously, although I could not see and

was covered with blood.

  A young friend congratulates me on my seventy years and

asks me for my opinion of education. I  reply:-  "Remember

that man differs from other animals in this: By habit, care,

self-culture, he can improve every faculty, add to his power,

and supply in some degree all defects. Learn to know thyself

[yourself] to the end that you may improve your powers, your

conduct, your character. This is the true aim of education; and

the best of all education is self-education."

  A  happy birthday.  Mary, Birchard, Sherman, Webb,  and

Fanny present; a good letter from Scott. At dinner, Mrs. Mil-

ler also. A drive by the High Bridge [and] the cemetery.

  Cutting out trees in the grove so as to bring into view the

veteran oak near main entrance. Webb worked "like a Trojan"

(one of Uncle Birchard's phrases).      Mem.:--Will call the

said oak "the Old Veteran."  Veterans need not be old.  Grant

called all soldiers veterans who had been under fire in battle

if they stood it well.

  October 5. Wednesday. - The Bible and Shakespeare both

use birthday in the sense of anniversary of one's birthday.

  Spent the day with the trees, letters, and the Chautauqua at

home; and abroad in a meeting of the Methodist Episcopal of-

ficial board. Fixed salary of pastor [at] thirteen hundred dol-

lars, the total [budget] at twenty-two hundred dollars. I notified

the board - and all agreed it was fair and best - that the pay-

ment by me of one-fourth the debt of the church depended on

paying in two years from October 4, 1892, and if I lived.

  October 6.  Thursday.--With Fanny  and Miss Avery to

Cleveland. A good little visit, and at 8:30 P. M., on a good

train, Fanny and I to Albany.

  October 7.  Friday. - To Mohonk on time.  A pleasant wel-

come. Dine and at room. Took the Fox Path with Mr.

Vredenburg,  of  Chicago,  and Mr.  Martin  or  Marston,  of









             <B>NEW YORK'S GREAT PARADES          113</B>



Brooklyn. Stood the rough tramp well. Mr. and Mrs. Pierce,

of Norwich, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Carter, of New York, Mr.

Ward, of Westchester.

  October 8. Mohonk House.-In the evening came Mr.

Houghton and his daughter, General Morgan, Commissioner

of Indian Affairs, etc. Also afternoon about twenty people.

Politics with Mr. Smith, Houghton, Morgan, and Mr. Smiley.

  October 9. Sunday. -Cool; gleams of sun and clouds. As

I look from my room (southwest corner, third story), I see

the extensive valley and over to the Catskills.  Walked this

afternoon with Fanny to Eagle Cliff and up into the tower. A

noble view. Probably nothing finer anywhere.

  October 10.  Monday.-Cool, clear, beautiful.  Will go this

morning to New York with Fanny to attend the Peabody meet-

ing and perhaps the naval parade tomorrow and the grand

parade Wednesday [in celebration of the quadricentennial an-

niversary of the discovery of America by Columbus].

 New York, October 11.  Tuesday.-A  letter from Chairman

Gardner that Judge Dittenhoeffer would escort us to the naval

parade, 9:45 A. M.

  The naval parade  was  "august."  In all respects worthy.

Met the Vice-President, Mrs. Grant, Mrs. McClellan. Intro-

duced Frances to them.  Escorted  Mrs. Grant to the lunch.

Governor Flower most agreeable. Mayor Grant, Judge Brown,

General Horace Porter,  Noble,  Rusk, and a world of other

notables.

  Dined happily at 60 East Seventy-ninth, Charles L. Mead's.

  October 12. Wednesday. - Weather still good. The great

parade today; Slater committee; Peabody board.

  At eleven with General McCook headed the procession of

notables out of [the] Fifth Avenue [Hotel] through the crowds

to the reviewing stand. Governor Flower, on the right, Vice-

President Morton next, then General Schofield. Then I came

with ex-President Cleveland.    In the rear Governor  Foster,

Elkins, Rusk, Tracy, etc. The United States troops first, and

so on. Now, at 4 P. M., they are still passing.

   8 H.D.









<B>114          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I left in an hour and attended the meeting of the Peabody

trustees. Got favorable action on Mississippi and Florida. They

will share with others the benefits of the fund, notwithstanding

their repudiation.  Also got a committee not favorable to scat-

tering the fund after four years --after the thirty years of its

limit.  That is as much concentration as the trust admits of in

view of Mr. Peabody's instructions and wish.  The committee

consists of the chairman, Mr. Winthrop, the general agent, Dr.

Curry, Hayes, Fuller, Henry, and

  One interesting question arises.  When the thirty years has

expired, viz., February 1897, the then board will decide as to

continuing or distributing the fund, and if distributed, how.

  Evening the Peabody banquet. Escorted Mrs. William Wirt

Henry, of Richmond, to the table. Mr. Evarts presided with

Mrs. Chief Justice Fuller. The Chief Justice escorted Fanny.

Present:  Bishop Whipple, Drexel, Green, Porter, Courtenay,

Gibson, Henry, Somerville, and Endicott and Curry; Mrs.

Curry, [Mrs.] Henry, and Mrs. Pierce, Miss Henry. A quiet,

enjoyable banquet. Found Mrs. Henry a good table mate; a

firm Presbyterian, fair-minded, gracious, and interesting. She

told how my friend was "hypnotized" by Mrs. Hardy.

  October 13.  Thursday.  New  York. -Men are busy taking

down the great stands in sight from our windows. The papers

are full of the stupendous affair.  It was not nearly so inspir-

ing as the G. A. R. encampment at Washington,--the proces-

sion not so long,-but a good affair of its sort.  Tonight ends

it with a banquet. The tall tower on the corner of Twenty-

fifth [Street] at Madison Square was the spectacle of last night

with its electric illumination.

  Dr. Curry and Dr. Gilman meet at my room at ten o'clock

on Slater business.  Old friends meet me  and greet me  so

pleasantly; General A. G. McCook, Jacobus, Elkins, Warner

Miller, Bishop Whipple.  The bishop says Winthrop said: "Tell

President Hayes we all admire and love him."

  In the evening attended the banquet which wound up the

great celebration. Mayor Grant, a young man, presided; near

him Governor Flower; next on his right Vice-President Morton









             <B>MOHONK INDIAN CONFERENCE          115</B>



and Mr. Cleveland; on his left myself, General Horace Porter,

et al. Speeches so-so, except Porter's which was so good. Mrs.

Curry, Dr. Curry, and Fanny with Mrs. Curry's sister, Miss

Pierce, in Box 23.

  The Greek tried to make the most of every faculty of body

and mind. He knew that every faculty was capable of almost

infinite improvement.

  October 14.  Friday.- Early up and with Fanny to Mohonk.

Welcomed warmly by the generous hosts and found a large at-

tendance at the Indian Conference.        Dawes  and  wife, Mrs.

Claflin, Houghton and daughter, Pierce and wife (both Pierces);

Joseph Cook, Theodore Roosevelt, [and] Commissioner Morgan.

  Took a rowing exercise with Miss Houghton around the lake.

In the evening Conference meeting. A platform adopted. On

resolutions approving Mr. Dawes by Pierce (E. L.), I spoke

offhand complimentary of him. Also Cook, General Morgan,

Roosevelt, et al. A good wind-up of the Conference.

  October  15.  Saturday. -  Fine weather.      The  most of the

friends go this morning. Mr. Houghton says liquor sellers are on

the right side of many questions.  They want to be, because

they are on the defensive by reason of their business and they

are glad of a chance to offset its disgrace by counter virtues!

The cause of political apathy is general prosperity and a general

dislike by the active political elements, the workers, of the

candidates of both parties. So the very merit of the Administra-

tion prevents that interest in politics which is essential to the

triumph of its party.

  October 16. Sunday.--As I look out of my room window

across the valley to the Catskills, in the mist of an Indian Sum-

mer morning, the beautiful autumnal colors of the forest in

the prime of their glory greet and gladden the old eyes. We

leave Mohonk tomorrow. "When shall we see its like again?"

  After breakfast with Fanny walked to Sky Top. Stopped

in the summer-house  called "Hayes  Lookout"-one  of the

finest views at Mohonk. Mrs. Smiley and Fanny nailed

up the name yesterday. It is on a cliff before reaching Sky









<B>116          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Top and commands an extensive and majestic landscape-

rocks, mountains, valleys, and different States.

  A sermon by Mr. Painter,--the blessings that come to good-

ness in the lives of the lowly, the needy, and the suffering.

The pivotal idea was, the equality of privilege is the vital

point between rich and poor, lofty and lowly, prosperous and

unfortunate, viz., in the formation of character--that which

controls and determines destiny.

  October 17.  Monday.- Bid good-bye to our good friends

the Smileys at Mohonk and other friends about 8:30 A. M.,

and depart.  .  .  . A very pleasant assemblage of passengers

on the Chicago limited from  Albany, Vice-President Morton,

Governor Flower and staff, and, especially, Mr. and Mrs. Eras-

tus Corning, of Albany, Mr. and Mrs. Perkins, of Rochester,

(friends of Uncle's friend, Samuel Works of Lockport), Mr.

Melvil Dewey, [and] a gentleman of the Prison Congress who

resembles somewhat Warner Miller.

  October 18.  Chicago.--After  a most  agreeable  all-night

swift ride, here by 10 A. M.  Met at the depot by Mr. Abner

Taylor, of Chicago, formerly of Ohio, and taken in a carriage

to the Grand Pacific.  Taken with Fanny to an excellent parlor

on the best floor.  Visited rapidly by reporters, etc.

  Afternoon, with Rutherford and Fanny out to the Fair by

the Illinois Central.  Colonel Rice took us in his carriage to the

great hall, "Manufacturing and Liberal Arts."  It is astound-

ing in size and beauty.  "August," grows on one.  Seats forty-

five thousand.

  All surprisingly beautiful -stupendous, amazing, unequalled.

  October 19.  Wednesday. - Mr. Taylor came early; gave us

a carriage.  A  delightful drive.  Lincoln statue, Grant ditto,

park and lake shore, private dwellings--all excellent.

  Callers numerous.  Afternoon, drove out the boulevards-

Grand, Drexel, etc.  Saw the drill and inspection of the Regular

Artillery and Cavalry; the decorations. All amazingly good.

  Evening the ball at the Auditorium, the Chicago.  Sat with

Mrs. Burroughs, of Michigan, in seats of Supreme Court to









             <B>COLUMBIAN FAIR DEDICATION          117</B>



which I was taken by Justice Harlan.  Shook hands with a

host of people  from  Alaska  to Georgia,  Maine  to Texas.

Escorted Mrs. Miles to the handsome dining-hall, six or so

stories up.-A stupendous success.





               GRAND PACIFIC, CHICAGO, October 19, 1892.

  MY DEAR AUNTY AUSTIN:--We came here yesterday

direct from Mohonk-leaving there at 8:30 A. M.  and reach-

ing here about 10 A. M.      I found agreeable recollections of

you constantly at Mohonk.  Mr. and Mrs. Smiley were particu-

larly cordial in their words.  The place never seemed more at-

tractive. The autumnal colors were superb.

  Our New York visit was also excellent of its kind.  At the

last moment--unexpected before--it was deemed best to have

Fanny come with me here.  It was very fortunate that we so

decided.  We find all things most satisfactory.  We  have one

of the finest rooms and all ---Rud, Fan, and I- live and sleep

in it altogether comfortably!  It is a large elegant parlor with

no bed in sight. Called for!

                          Sincerely,

  MRS. L. C. AUSTIN,                  RUTHERFORD  B. HAYES.

    Cleveland.



  October 20.  Thursday. -  1.  Civic parade.  2.  Supreme

Court reception.  3.  Club  (Fellowship).  4.  Reception  of

-    at the armory.

  [The] Honorable Abner Taylor, a partner of C. B. Farwell,

ex-Member of Congress, proves to be a most agreeable gentle-

man to be in charge of; must recall him always with pleasure.

  The most notable part of the civic parade was the Carlisle

Indian School, under Captain Pratt, marching with hoes, rakes,

spades, and other instruments of husbandry.  As at New York,

[I was] everywhere greeted with enthusiasm. Governor Rus-

sell on horseback and  Governor McKinley  in carriage drew

most applause.

  The Fellowship Club in the evening was the most elegant affair

of the sort I have ever seen.









<B>118          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  October 21.  Friday.-The great day of dedication.  Drove

out  in procession  rapidly-sun  just  enough  veiled-with

Colonel Taylor, next behind the mayor and the Wheelmen

Number 12. Greeted with enthusiasm as soon as recognized;

stood up often; and more "Hayes," "Hayes," "Hayes" than ever

since I left the Presidency.  Cheering was hearty; hand-clap-

ping and waving handkerchiefs general and hearty-more than

in any other part of the line in sight or hearing. Of course I

enjoyed it, and Colonel Taylor seemed delighted.

  The military parade was beautiful and greatly enjoyed by

all of us. It was in Washington Park, as I suppose. The

great hall, 1687 by 787  [feet], was  jammed  full.  Cavalry

trotted in and out in passages kept open. A wonderful spec-

tacle; one hundred thousand at least under one roof, ninety

thousand in chairs. Speaking all too long and of no importance;

not heard.

  In the evening a noble oration by Archbishop Ireland in favor

of the congresses for moral, educational, and religious [in-

terests].

  October  23.  Sunday.-Home  again  after  almost  three

weeks' absence at Mohonk, New York City, and Chicago, with

Fanny all of the time and with Rud P. at Chicago. An ex-

ceedingly agreeable tour.

  At Chicago the following persons were very kind and useful

to me-not to be forgotten:-Colonel Abner Taylor, Member

of Congress from South District of Chicago. No escort could

have been in all respects so good. Baker, who named a three-

masted schooner after me fifteen years ago - a lucky and profit-

able vessel, still alive and doing well. William Henry Smith

and Delavan -old friends.

  October 24. Monday.-The clearing out [of] our grove to

open it and give better views is altogether with good results.

I counted this morning the new stumps; one hundred and sixty-

four, and no doubt some were omitted.

  The glass windows in the front door, put in since I left home,

are a cheerful improvement. - This  afternoon, I with Jimmy

(Ellicott) took up the best of the Napoleon (Washington) wil-









             <B>THE DEATH OF MRS. HARRISON          119</B>



lows and planted it near the grave of Uncle Birchard in Oak-

wood. One of Uncle's pet notions was the value to the world

of Napoleon's genius - Napoleon's wars.

  Evening, read the Daily Chronicle, London, sent by the sec-

retary of the Howard Association. A liberal paper that is very

democratic in its doctrines,--e. g.: All men  and women  in

Great Britain ought to have the right to vote.

  October 25.  Tuesday.--I felt the old shadow coming over

me yesterday, due in part to the unfavorable reports about Mrs.

Harrison. She seems near her end. Lucy left us three years

and four months ago this morning.

  Later.--Mr. Keeler telephones that Mrs. Harrison died this

morning.  What a calamity, at such a time, has come to the

President! Nothing more crushing can be imagined. The only

relief is that she is out of suffering and that he is at the

end of this cruel suspense. I will write him a few words.

  Shall I go to the funeral of Mrs. Harrison at Indianapolis?

Yes, if it is to be a general public funeral and I can do it with-

out too much exposure in night travel. I recall distinctly and

gratefully how all attentions at Lucy's funeral were felt to be

an honor to her which I greatly appreciated.





                                 SPIEGEL, October 25, 1892.

  MY  FRIEND:-We  reached home most comfortably Satur-

day. I find here your favor of the 7th. You say that your post-

poned September visit "shall yet be made before snow falls."

That suits all around. I am to be at home a full month. Come

soon and stay long.

  I can't help thinking of the President's fate!-Lucy left us

three years and four months ago today.         These dates, 21St,

25th, 28th, are sad days always; better than they were--far

better--but all of them gloom itself.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH,

    Chicago.









<B>120          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Octooer 27.  Thursday.--Today I go to Indianapolis.  My

message  to Judge  Martindale  (E. B.)  was  answered  from

Chicago:  "Appropriate and desirable that you come.  Dispatch

me at Indianapolis as to route and time of arrival."

  October 28.  Friday.- At  Indianapolis.  At  the fine resi-

dence of Judge E. B. Martindale, one daughter and one son,

Mrs. Martindale, the judge, and [Mr.] Palmer, president of the

Chicago Fair. A noble dwelling; high ceilings, hall through the

centre, gas fires; elegantly furnished; library, etc., etc.; a most

hospitable home.

  At 9:30 A. M. in carriage with Governor Chase and President

Palmer to the depot to escort President and Cabinet [from]

funeral train to the church.  Streets greatly thronged.  Church

beautifully and tastefully decorated, flowers, etc. General Wal-

lace says that the church was very tasty. The clergyman, [the]

Rev. [Dr. M. L. Haines], in a plain but good way performed

his part; all so fittingly done in spite of temptations to be

sentimental or sensational. A long pleasant ride to the ceme-

tery [Crown Hill]. There a wide circle, more than a hundred

yards across, with a vast multitude of people all the way round.

The Cabinet, relatives, [and] friends went into the circle. The

fresh earth from the grave and the grave covered with ever-

greens and flowers on the evergreens.       All appropriate  and

beautiful.

  I am  glad I went.  [I was]  doubtful about it.  I sent to

Judge Martindale:--"Confidential.  Wish to attend funeral if

public."  He replied:  [As already given.]

  Called with General Wallace, Judge Martindale, and General

Palmer on the President.     Received cordially.  Invited to go

on his train to Columbus en route home.

  Dined on cars with the President. His aide, Parker of the

Navy, very polite; insisted on seeing me safely [off the train] at

Columbus at midnight; also the young gentleman of the Baltimore

and Ohio who looks after such special trains.

  October 29. Saturdays. - Slept at the Chittenden, Columbus,

and after breakfast took a second breakfast with Laura. Then

home.









             <B>MRS. HARRISON'S FUNERAL          121</B>



  October 30.  Sunday.--Letters and reading afternoon and

evening.

  I must begin my address for the Prison Congress.  How will

this do for a first sentence? One of the tests of the civiliza-

tion of people is the treatment of its criminals.







                                SPIEGEL, November 1, 1892.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I have your favor of yesterday. It

will be a good thing to meet at your home and talk over the

sketch of General Buckland. I hope to be at home all of this

and next week. I will write to Captain Lemmon making the

suggestion that we meet on the day you fix and notify us.

  All well here--leaves falling fast--an old-fashioned Indian

Summer following the gusty Squaw Winter of last week.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

    Sandusky.



  November  4.  Friday.--To  Sandusky; met after dark by

General Force and Horton and driven to the Soldiers' Home.

Met Mrs. Force, Mrs. Horton, and Judge Lemmon. After an

agreeable, social, and excellent supper, the judge  (Lemmon)

and General Force joined me in reading the preparation for

General Buckland's sketch for the Ohio Loyal Legion.  We

agreed to give full details of his early life--all interesting facts

showing character. This will make the sketch longer than usual,

but it is well. Talked at length on the war, etc., etc.

  November 5.  Saturday.-  Morning spent delightfully with

Force. Visited the working buildings--after a superb dinner.

--Mem.:--Mrs. Force understands how to refresh the inner

man with the best food, excellently cooked and served, and of

the best varieties. Home about 3 P. M.

  General W. A. Knapp, formerly adjutant-general on my staff,

now assistant attorney-general for Post-office Department, ar-

rived.









<B>122          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  November 6. Sunday. - Spent the day with General Knapp.

He has an unusual memory for conversations of years ago. He

visited here about 1874. Almost twenty years ago.

  November 8.  Tuesday.-- Election day.        The lack of in-

terest continues.  Whether Harrison or Cleveland, is in doubt.

If a full discussion had been had, I think Harrison's reelection

would have come with the vote of every Northern State. As

it is, it seems to me the chance of Cleveland is the best. The

country can stand it.

  Mrs. Lydia Hoyt Farmer, of Cleveland, takes up the women

of America for the Columbian Fair.  She wants materials for

Mrs. Hayes' biography. I must furnish her with the material.

I send her the Howe "Ohio History," and will call to see her

with other sketches.

  November 9.  Wednesday.--The  election  is reported  "a

landslide"! Even Ohio is claimed by the Democrats. As I see,

both candidates lack personal popularity.  Neither excites en-

thusiasm with the active men in politics-the workers. This

has led to the most lethargic canvass ever known in a Presi-

dential contest. This is the explanation, number one; for in

such a canvass the Democrats always have the advantage. The

saloons can rally out the ignorant elements, so large in the

Democratic party.    Two.    The  outs always have  the better

chance. Three and chiefly. The labor vote, holding the balance

of power and better organized than ever before, joined the

Democrats. This is shown by the vote of the large cities, Bos-

ton, Brooklyn, New York, Chicago, and, in Ohio, notably

Youngstown and Mahoning County, Canton and Stark County,

Newark and Licking County, Akron and Summit County, and

Cleveland. They evidently thought they did not get their share

of the profits of their labor by an increase of wages. The argu-

ment of Governor Campbell steadily and persistently urged,

"Where is the workingman who gets an increase of wages and

better employment under the McKinley Bill?" Workingmen

saw the capitalists going to Europe to spend the fortunes ac-

quired in America, while labor was not in an equal degree









             <B>MR. CLEVELAND ELECTED          123</B>



benefited by protection. So, labor, holding the balance of power,

threw its votes in favor of a change.

  How about the future? At the next general election, with

a free-trade or revenue tariff enacted by the Democrats, will

Governor Campbell ask: "What laborer gets better wages by

reason of the new law?" Or will it be Governor McKinley

that will repeat that question with an emphasis that will win

back the balance of power?

  Snow everywhere on the trees and the sun shining brightly

makes a gay and splendid outlook in old Spiegel.

  In the eleven o'clock train to Cleveland.--Reached 891 Pros-

pect at 2:30 P. M.

  Evening, called on Mrs. Lydia Hoyt Farmer. Talked fully

about Lucy. Mrs. Farmer will prepare a short sketch. Very

satisfactory interview.

  November 11. Friday. - For the negro: Religion, education,

and a trade. The triple key: Hand, mind, character.

  The trinity: Churches, schools, workshops.

  Mrs. Hayes was personally known and loved by more people

than any other woman in the world.

  Reached home about 7 P. M. from Cleveland. Charley

Thompson [was] my seat-mate--an intelligent man who made

the miles seem shorter, whether as a listener to me, or as a

talker.  Which was most interesting to me?

  November 12. Saturday.- Scott came before breakfast. In

fine health.  Surprised at the election and its defeats for his

party. We old fellows have seen too many such to feel it as

the young do. We abide in the confident hope that when real

issues, vital questions, are before the people there will be no

lethargy - few mistakes; enthusiastic support of the men and the

party which is for the country. Ohio is still in doubt.

  November 13. Sunday.--Our pastor preached one of his

good, fervid sermons to a crowded church full of people. We

sit (the old-timers, the regular attendants)  in the same seats

as a habit. But in fact all seats are free. Yet it must often

happen that the regulars if a little late find their seats taken.

This offends or annoys some of the brethren. I find it agree-









<B>124          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



able.  I do so like to see a crowded house.  I sat in the north-

west corner where I could keep my eyes on the red star of the

"Old Kanawha Division."

  November 15.  Tuesday.--I am getting into form my Balti-

more talk; not much written but my thoughts begin to shape

to the affair.

  November 16.  Wednesday. -  Made good progress with my

little speech. Warm, fluent, strong; but old straw in the main.

  November 17. Thursday.--Read and wrote on the Balti-

more talk. Made fair progress.

  November  18.  Friday.--Gave to the printer the first half

or two-thirds  of  my  Baltimore  talk.     Received  from  Mrs.

Farmer her tribute to Lucy.       Exceedingly well done.      Mrs.

Farmer is [a] daughter of a devout clergyman. She naturally

represents Lucy as a professing Christian, using the words and

phrases commonly employed - "spiritual," "deeply religious,"

"saintly."  Mrs. Hayes was a woman of deeds.  She believed

in following Christ literally.  She could walk with publicans

and sinners.

  November 19.  Sunday.-- Mr. Albritton preached a fine ser-

mon  on justification.  I could not accept his doctrine, but the

morality he would inculcate and the practical duties he insisted

on were sound and well put.



                               SPIEGEL, November 20, 1892.

  MY  DEAR FRIEND:--I am  glad to get your note from In-

dianapolis.  You are a busy man.  To get out of business is

no easy matter with a man of your faculties. But let us hope.

  I go with Fanny to attend Prison Reform people at Baltimore,

Saturday, 3d [of] December.  We must start the second.  This

leaves small hours to talk up the first; but if the only chance,

come.  Winter is upon us.

  The election!  The wonder is the landslide was not more

sweeping. The Democrats, I believe, carried just half of the

States!                     Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.









             <B>PRESIDENT UNIVERSITY BOARD          125</B>



  P. S.--Thanks  for Housatonic's capital paper on Adams.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.





  November 22.  Tuesday.--Reached Columbus  11:30 A. M.

Found at Captain Cope's office President Scott, Godfrey, Cope,

Chamberlain, Wing, Schueller, a quorum of the trustees of the

university. Worked hard until 1 P. M.  Dined together at the

Neil House and worked until 6 P. M.  Dined again at Laura's.

       Worked until 10 P. M. as a board.

  November 23.  Wednesday.--To  university.  Found  Hayes

Hall a fine building.  To be used at once for drill and dancing

rooms. Orton Hall not yet under roof.

  Professor Orton happily recovering from his attack of par-

alysis. At 11 A. M. returned to Captain Cope's office and

worked until 1 P. M. Dined together at the Neil.  A  merry

time of good stories.

  Afternoon,  elected officers.  In ignorance  of any  plan or

"caucus," I moved the reelection of Godfrey.       Not seconded.

I put the vote.  No yeas; but I did not take the hint.  Godfrey,

as president, called for ballots.  It was a complete surprise to

me when it turned out that I got all the votes except my own

for Godfrey.

  November 25.  Friday.-Another day that recalls the dear

one. She was in my mind the whole day yesterday. Thanks-

giving with her to guide and direct was a perpetual joy.

  Tonight a musicale will enliven old Spiegel.  Fanny Pease,

Lucy Keeler, and Mary Miller unite with Fanny-my  darling

Fanny--to pay their debts by a social event.  Mrs. Millikin,

of Cleveland, (she was Miss Severance) a musician of repute,

and a pianiste, Miss Anna Bern. The invitations are over two

hundred and fifty.

  November  26.  Saturday.--All  but  about  twenty-five  or

thirty accepted, and the number strained the capacity of old

Spiegel.  The guests were in their best array.  Fremont turns

out a gay and beautiful gathering when the effort is genuine.









<B>126          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



It was altogether successful.    Refreshments  served to guests

seated.  I retired at midnight.

  The singing was excellent by Mrs. Millikin.  It was quiet,

sweet, silver-toned, and penetrating. The [pianiste] Miss Bern

is tall [and] well-looking. A German only three months from

Germany; talks English quite well, and her playing is no doubt

good. The married ladies who are my company when I drive

were generally present, viz., Mrs. Miller, Mrs. Bristol, Mrs.

Dorr, Mrs. Pease, Mrs. Ludwig, Mrs. Dudrow; also Miss Anna

Stilwell, Miss Rosa Ames.

  November 27.  Sunday.-Wrote several letters.  To my old

friend, Guy M. Bryan, after some months of silence. I hope

he will be as cordial as ever in his reply. His silence longer

than usual and his increasing morbid tendency always fills me

with apprehension that [he] feels hurt over something if I do

not hear from him.

  Read  at home  the speech  for Baltimore,  December  3.  It

sounds better, as I get more familiar with it. This the re-

verse of the common result of rereading.

  November 28. Monday. --I go to Toledo this morning to re-

turn at 2:30 P. M., after seeing Professor Adams. 1. To see

if he will reconsider, if I promise to improve the inducements.

2. To get his opinion of the principal of the technical school

at Cincinnati. 3. To get his help in finding a director for our

manual training department.

  December 1.  Thursday. -With Fanny to Columbus.             My

old friend General Potter died suddenly. Called. Met the fine-

looking, manly son Joseph. Called on Rogers. Friendly and

cordial.

  Called with Captain Cope and architect at the college. The

springs are probably safe. Buildings going on well.

  Baltimore, December 3.  Saturday. -  Left Columbus at seven

last night. At Newark found General Brinkerhoff. Good man.

Reached  Baltimore after a pleasant journey about  1 P.  M.

Good quarters at the Carrollton.









             <B>PRISON ASSOCIATION AT BALTIMORE          127</B>



  Evening at the opera house. President Gilman and the Na-

tional Prison Association people.  Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop

-, of Oregon.

  A very good attendance. The Cardinal's prayer was excel-

lent.  My speech well received.

  December 4.  Sunday. - Fair and beautiful.  Church with

the National Prison Association. A very eloquent, apt, and

valuable sermon--"timely and helpful."

  Dined with Mrs. McFarland, Captain and Mrs. Bergland,

Miss Stilwell, and the boys.  Afternoon, at the Maryland Peni-

tentiary, with Judge Wayland. Made talks; grand singing; a

good prison.

  Evening, presided at opera house. Rev. Dr. Wayland and

Charles J. Bonaparte made good and witty talks.

  December 5. Monday. - A. M.  A good meeting; fine paper.

P. M.  At President Gilman's.  Greek pictures in his fine li-

brary. Dinner with the two Waylands, Brockway, [the] Rev.

Z-, [and] Wines.

  Evening at the Friends' meeting-house. Even full. A noble

and wise paper by Carroll [D.] Wright, Labor Commissioner.

  December 6.  Tuesday.--A. M.  Meeting in Sutro Hall.  An

excellent paper on police by McClaughry.  P. M.        At Johns

Hopkins. A few minutes' talk to the students: also by Wines,

Brockway, and Rosenau.

  With Fanny to dine at Mr. Levering's.       President Gilman,

Gill, attorney-general, and ten or twelve others.

  Evening at the Friends' meeting-house.  Dr. Jacobi of New

York gave an excellent lecture--with a large number of skulls

for illustration of his point that crime was largely due to

physical causes for which the criminal is not wholly responsible.

I made up my mind that life should not be taken for murder.

It is brutalizing in its influence on the community. That is

reason enough. But more life leaves opportunity for reform.

  Another valid day!

  December 7. Wednesday.-Warm and fair. A good paper

and discussion in Sutro Hall.









<B>128          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  At 11 A. M. on steamer down Patapsco Bay to the Chesa-

peake and Annapolis. There Judge McGruche took charge of

me and we visited the room with the relics, the chapel, the li-

brary (very elegant), the Senate Chamber, where Washington

laid down the sword, with its portraits [and] its picture of the

scene, and were back to Baltimore at 5:30 P. M. On the

steamer had a paper on the "Physician's Place in Prison" by Dr.

  , of Elmira, another good paper, and a paper by Dr. Ran-

som on punishments,  favoring some  "physical treatment"-

some of what Brockway calls "personal contact." I choked off

a "funny man," who wanted to present the "ugliest man" a

a rose (an onion), intending to give it to a very fine-looking

man, Rosenau, of Buffalo. My action was very welcome.

  Evening, Mr. Sutro piloted Fanny and self to the Carrollton

Hotel.  We  got our tea and hurried to the depot in time  for

7:15 train, Baltimore and Ohio, for Columbus after a happy

time for both of us at Baltimore.  Perhaps our best meeting.

  December  8.  Thursday.- Reached Columbus about 12:30

and were soon among the wedding guests at General Mitchell's

for the wedding breakfast of Lilly and James Henry  Heyl.  A

most agreeable affair. We were, as expected, too late for the

ceremony at the church, but all as we  wished.  Presents, com-

pany, etc., etc., "lovely."  At a small table with Mrs. Dennison.

Laura and Mrs. Collins were the company. Evening, a happy

call on Rogers and Mrs. Rogers.

  December 9.  Friday.-Home at 5 P. M. after two hours

and a half delay at Fostoria.

  We read our novels, Fanny the Church novel of the Chau-

tauqua course-"Callias, or the Fall of Athens"-about 400

B. C., -and I the "Downfall of Napoleon the Third," by Zola.

  December  10.  Saturday.-All day writing letters, but  the

heap on my table is still appalling.  Why do people write to me

on their own affairs, and at such unconscionable length? Why

not skip all but the nub and put that in the fewest words? The

time is coming when I must use the waste-basket for the lion's

share of my correspondence.









             <B>PRISON ASSOCIATION AT BALTIMORE          129</B>



 December 11. Sunday. - Bishop Leonard preached a sermon

on Christ - the "burning question" of our time: "Getters

should be such only to be givers." An earnest, pungent sermon.





        SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 12, 1892.

  MY DEAR SENATOR: - It will give me pleasure to furnish you

with such photographs as I have. I send two of cabinet size.

The one of "age seventy" is enlarged to the size you want, and

is thought well of. I can have the one "age sixty-three" done

the same way if preferred.     I can also have one age sixty-

five.-As to the period of the Presidency,  I have none of

suitable size. But the boys suggest that I have the oil painting

in the White House photographed. In any event I will send

you several of the size you want to choose from.  It will

gratify me to have one on your walls.

                         Sincerely,

                                  RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    United States Senate.



  December 13. Tuesday. - I go to Cleveland today and

thence to Sandusky and home about Thursday.

  General Barnett writes me as to a list of jurors for the

United States Court. Will see about it. We ought not to pack

juries with men of our own party alone. I will have no part

or lot in it, if this is the rule. Will see.

  At Sandusky must see as to the G. A. R. presents, and as

to Buckland sketch for Loyal Legion.

  December  20.   Tuesday.- Began preparing  for speech at

Columbus, December 27, and spent the day for the most part

in this work. Almost finished it.

  December  22.  Thursday.- Finished speech  for  the  Ohio

College Association, Senate Chamber, December 27. It is made

up of scraps of former speeches largely. Evening at the post,

G. A. R.

   9 H. D.









<B>130          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  December 23. Friday. -Visited Dr. John B. Rice, our lead-

ing physician. An able man supposed to be dying of Bright's

disease. He is greatly emaciated; has been confined to his

bed several weeks. As he grows thinner he looks more like

his brother, Dr. Robert Rice.  He talks with difficulty.  I kept

up a cheerful talk. He seemed to enjoy it.

  We have a rifle, old-fashioned, home-made, carried by Dr.

Webb--probably not as a mounted Kentucky rifleman in the

War of 1812, but as a hunter in Ross County, Ohio, about 1825-

30. Thanks to the Cooks -Uncle William's son and daughter.

  December 25.  Sunday. -  Snow falling, already four or five

inches deep. A "Merry Christmas," indeed. Scott came at mid-

night looking well. A. M. Heard the farewell sermon of Mr.

Barnes, after ten years and over of service as pastor of the

Presbyterian congregation. He had preached twenty-two hun-

dred sermons- three thousand if special services are counted;

[made] five hundred and fifty pastoral visits a year; [known]

thirty-five deaths of members; one hundred and sixty-four

[had] left for other places, [and there had been] three hundred

and fifty accessions to the church. A sensible sermon. Too

good a preacher for his people.

  Dinner--all the family present, also Mr. and Mrs. Miller.

Afternoon, the presents to the little folks.     A  glorious time.

Sherman and Webb gave us a great deal of happiness. Snow-

the first day of sleighing. Drove to church in the sleigh. Cold,

dry snow but enough for use.

  I go to Cleveland tomorrow to the Kenyon banquet.

  December 26. Monday. - To Cleveland. Met at the Union

Depot by Dempsey, Esq., and in carriage to 891 Prospect. On

street cars at 7 P. M. to the Stillman to attend the Second An-

nual banquet of the Kenyon Association - "Kenyon College

Alumni Association." Presided over an agreeable banquet of

about fifty.  Spoke at the close--a rambling speech--on old

times at Kenyon and the lasting college friendships. Illustrated by

reading a Christmas letter from my best friend Guy M. Bryan

just after midnight.









             <B>ADVICE TO McKINLEY          131</B>



  December 27.  Tuesday. - To Columbus - leaving Cleveland

about 8:30 A. M.

  Evening, to a fine audience in the hall of the House of Repre-

sentatives spoke on manual training before the (State College)

"Ohio College Association" - twenty-fifth annual meeting. Got

it off well. Greeted pleasantly by eighteen or twenty college

presidents, perhaps forty or fifty professors, and a large num-

ber of Franklin County Teachers' Association. Among hearers

Professor John Williams White, the famous Greek scholar,

founder of the Greek College at Athens.

  Governor McKinley and wife were on the train down from

Cleveland and we had a full, good talk. I write him today as

follows:

  "MY DEAR GOVERNOR: -I have slept on the question of re-

organizing the University this winter.     On  both grounds  it

would be a mistake.  1.  Not best for the cause of education.

2.  Not well for your personal standing.

  "1. The institution stands well, is growing in favor, needs

no change, would be hurt by a seeming partisan measure.

  "2.  Too much reorganization of State institutions already

for your  personal  interests.   All appointments  hurt.     Five

friends are made cold or hostile for every appointment; no

new friends are made.  All patronage is perilous to men of real

ability or merit.  It aids only those who lack other claims to

public support.  Take this for what little it is worth."

  December 28.  Wednesday. - Met Wilgus at Captain Cope's

office on the law school. They must raise two or three thousand

dollars for each of the next two or three years. See Andrews

and Platt.  Met also the Underground Railroad author and told

him of the winters when the Ohio was frozen over, 1851-2,

1855-6(?), and the exodus of fugitive slaves.

  Also of the Underground Railroad running South to slavery

with free colored men from this region.

  December 30.  Friday. - Today definitely declined in a letter

to Governor John W. Hoyt to act as president of an organiza-









<B>132          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tion to promote the enactment by Congress of legislation estab-

lishing a National University at Washington. I think well of

the measure, but its chance at present is small, and I am too

busy with other duties to give it attention.

  My wedding day -  forty years ago! Few of the dear friends

of that occasion remain.     Lucy,  Platt, Sister Fanny, Uncle

Birchard, Mother (not present), General Buckland, Dr. Davis,

Stephenson, George Jones, David Jones, Uncle and Aunty War-

ren, the uncles and aunts of Lucy, Isaac, Lucy, Margaret, all

gone. Mr. and Mrs. Herron, Laura Mitchell, Aunty Davis,

[and] Professor McCabe, remain.

  January 1, 1893.  Sunday. - Mr. Albritton preached well on

the benefits of last year -"benefits in each of the four seasons,

benefits in each of the twelve months," etc.

  All happy New Year's days are good,--this, one of the best.

  January 5.  Thursday. - With H. R. Finefrock, Wilson, and

Brinkerhoff, committee of I. O. O. F., met at station

Judge H. C. Glenn, of Van Wert, and Mrs. Schouler, of Union

County, committee of Grand  Lodge to look up site for an

I. O. O. F. Orphans' Home. We drove to Spiegel. Got

warmed up.  Fanny dispensed coffee.  When in the snow-storm

we drove over to Leppelman's place. For eleven thousand dol-

lars the buildings and twenty acres are offered. The building

is much better than I had supposed. The offer I regard as

very favorable. The visiting committee regarded the scheme

as the best yet offered -decidedly so.

  Afternoon, Fanny got up a nice dinner for twelve.

  January 6. Friday.- Evening at Keeler's and church.

Barnes, the presiding elder, on hand.     A  good pounding ser-

mon.  Then quarterly conference.      Pastor reported favorably

on paying church debt. Four thousand dollars to raise? Hayes,

$1000; ladies $500; old subscriptions $500; and a new subscrip-

tion of $2080 - all good. Afternoon, drove with Mrs. and Sarah

Keeler and Mrs. Pease.

                                   SPIEGEL, January 6, 1893.

   MY DEAR DOCTOR:--I have your favor of the first. The de-

tails and general course of our tour, I leave to you entirely. We

may go from Nashville first to Texas if that is best in your

view. My preference is to go slower than we did last year.

Also to visit Austin, Galveston, and Guy Bryan-or at least

meet him for a day or two. - I will aim to leave here February

4, expecting to reach Cincinnati that night; to go to Louis-

ville next day, and then under your wing as you may choose.

What is your hotel in Louisville? Mine in Cincinnati is the

Burnet House.

  With all good wishes for Mrs. Curry from Spiegel.

                          Sincerely,

  HONORABLE J. L. M. CURRY.



         SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 6, 1893.

  MY  DEAR SIR:-All friends of prison reform feel the im-

portance of temperance. The trouble is lack of harmony among

the friends of the cause.  Besides, it is a very popular cause.

Its friends are everywhere.  We prefer to give special attention

to the unpopular questions--to those that need friends.  I will

send your valuable resolution to headquarters--to Secretary

Milligan. Don't ask for any more "practical plans." Unite on

any one of the forty plans already before the public, and avoid

fighting among friends.

                          Sincerely,

          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 7, 1893.

  My father and mother were both natives of Vermont. My

father was born in the town of Brattleboro and my mother in

Wilmington. They lived after their marriage first in Wilming-

ton, and a few years in Dummerston in their native county.  In

1817 they removed to Delaware, Ohio,--making the journey









<B>134          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



with their belongings in wagons in forty-nine days. My father

died in 1822, a few weeks before I was born.

  My mother made many journeys to her native State, and im-

parted a fair share of her unfailing affection for the Green

Mountains to her only son.

                                   SPIEGEL, March 8, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--I came home last night by way of Cleve-

land from Baltimore. I find a heap of letters waiting me. Not

one that gives me as much pleasure as yours. You should have

seen how happy you made Webb by your two letters from Colum-

bus.  "Well," he said, "'Tuss' will do.  He will win his way."

We (Rutherford and I) are alone here now. Birch is unwell,

housed up at home. Rutherford visits him today.

  I am too busy to write much. Your welfare is very near to

my heart. I now am happy in the thought that you will do well.

First of all, keep your conscience at the helm. Conscience is the

authentic voice of God to you. Do not be uneasy for salary or

promotion. But do strive to deserve it by fidelity and efficiency.

I think of you very hopefully.

                        Affectionately,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SCOTT R. HAYES.

  P. S.- I will subscribe for you for the [Fremont] Journal if

you have not done so.



                                  SPIEGEL, March 19, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--I reached home from Kenyon by way of

Cleveland last evening.  I find here your letter of the 15th

instant.

  My trip accomplished two things. I attended the funeral of

Bishop Bedell, an old and dear friend of about thirty years'

standing. He was a noble pulpit orator, a wise man, and a

genial, interesting, and friendly companion.









             <B>LAST ACTIVITIES          135</B>



   I also gave an address in the college lecture course to a large

 and enthusiastic audience in the old hall--Rosse Chapel--

where I gave my valedictory fifty years ago. I doubt if the old hall

ever rang before with such rousing cheers. It quite stirred up

and inspired the old gentleman.

   I want you to think with a purpose on the question of how

to use your spare time, especially your evenings. At all times

have on hand some solid reading. Either history, biography, or

natural science connected with your present business.     Do not

fail to learn all you can on your interesting department of

natural science. Watch all workmen, learn all facts, be practical

as well as a man of theories. Enough of this. Lilly goes home

on Monday.-All others well.

                    Good-bye, affectionately,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

     Cincinnati.

                                     SPIEGEL, March 26, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--Returning last evening after a two days'

visit to Mary and "all the boys" at Toledo, I was glad to find

here your letter of the 23d instant. We will look up the pictures

you mention and send them in due time.

  The people at the Triangle were all in fine condition. Sher-

man has made two long steps forward. He rides with his tri-

cycle as skilfully as possible; turns corners, dodges chairs and

tables and his little Webby brother, all in excellent fashion. The

other step is still larger. We put him into jacket and pantaloons.

He was fiercely delighted; no getting them off without an in-

dignant protest. He looked well and is indeed as he insists a

"big" boy. Webb was never so interesting. He has what, I

suppose, George means by "individuality." Certainly he is very

winning.

  I have had a light attack of grippe for a week past, with the

usual symptoms. Nothing serious.

  I shall visit General Force at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home

next week. About the 10th of next month I go to New York









<B>136          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



on the Slater business.  It may possibly send me on another

trip South. But not if I can get rid of it. All well here.

                        Affectionately,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SCOTT R. HAYES.

  P. S.-After a diligent search I found behind Mr. Thomas

Ewing the starchy young fellows. Now, I make a condition of

sending it that you put on the picture the names of the persons,

and the date. Do this to oblige me.



        FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL, NEW YORK, April 19, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT: - I have been here a week and have attended

to a good deal of business for the educational funds I am con-

nected with. I am now waiting for the return of an old friend,

from whom I expect assistance in regard to improvement of our

Duluth property. He (Mr. Pierce, of Norwich, Connecticut) will

be here tomorrow.  When business is done a stay even in New

York is tedious.

  I am glad to hear from Fanny that you write punctually.

Laura Fullerton, who is attending school here, will dine with

me this evening. After, we will call to see our other cousins -

the Howells[es] and Meads.  I do not expect to reach home be-

fore Saturday.

                 With all love, affectionately,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MY DEAR BOY:--Just home. A pile of letters to be attended

to compels me to be curt.  I hope and intend to visit Cincinnati

next week -  date of Loyal Legion meeting - and will then hope

to have a good visit with you.      Will stop at Burnet House.

  MY DEAR SCOTT: - Rutherford and Mrs. Platt have lost their

fine boy, William. He died this morning.

  Of course I will go to the funeral. My intention was to go

to the Grand Hotel Wednesday morning from Columbus leaving

here Tuesday for Cincinnati. But now I do not know. Prob-

ably I shall come at that time. Birch, Mary, Webb, and the little

boys are here.

                    Ever affectionately,

  MY DEAR BOY:--I was greatly pleased by what I saw and

learned touching your surroundings in Cincinnati.   The changes

you mention in your letter of yesterday will not, I trust, be to

your disadvantage.

  I am now almost entirely rid of the effects of the poison.

  At Piqua we had a good fraternal season in our G. A. R. re-

union.  I found all as I expected at home.    Fanny and I dined

with General Force at Sandusky on the wedding day of the Gen-

eral and Mrs. Force on the 13th and at Rev. Shackelford's the

14th. Both good occasions.

  Webb is here.  The excessive and long continued rains are in

the way of his building.

  Good-bye and good wishes.

                        Affectionately,

                                    SPIEGEL, May 24, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--I have been neglectful in not writing to

you for some time. My Decoration Day speech at Columbus has

taken the time given to the pen, together with a most burden-

some correspondence.    I go to Columbus to be there 30th, 31st,

and first [of] June.

  Webb is here often getting ahead with the Carbon Works as

fast as the wretched rains will permit.  Miss Avery is here for









<B>138          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



a week. Little Parmely Herrick kept the house awake three

days, visiting us with Webb.

  I was much pleased with a sentence Webb read me from a let-

ter of Mr. Brady, in which he speaks well of you. A little taffy

will not harm you and it helps the old codger mightily to hear

good words about his boy! See?

  I wish you could be here to enjoy the grove. It was never be-

fore so beautiful.

  Superb pictures of the two Toledo brats, as Webb calls the

fine boys at the Triangle, have been taken. I would send you

mine, but I suppose Mary may have sent them to you. All well

here. With good wishes.

  MY DEAR SCOTT: - I want to ask you in confidence, by which

I mean you are not to speak of it, as to the qualifications of

Mr. Adams, the principal of the high school in Toledo. He is

named for the head of our Manual Training School in the uni-

versity here. We want an able, scholarly man of zeal and tact,

industry and perseverance.  Is he such a man?

  I attended General Buckland's funeral the 31st ultimo and

returned here yesterday. I probably go home tomorrow.

  I rejoice to hear that you are giving satisfaction in your new

business. Take good care of your health.

  We long to see you in old Spiegel again. This is a busy month

for me.   But I hope we shall meet before it ends.

                        Affectionately,

  MY DEAR SCOTT: - Your letter about Mr. Adams is in all

respects excellent.  It is worth while for you to devote some

attention to letter writing--indeed to composition generally.

You are quite sure to be successful as a writer.

  Mr. Adams would do well for our place if he had given special

attention to manual training; possibly he will answer our pur-

pose.

  Webb has gone to the rumpus at Minneapolis [the Republican

National Convention]. Birch and family are as usual. Fanny

and Rud are in lawn tennis. I go to board meetings at Cleve-

land, Columbus, and Delaware and to a Loyal Legion banquet

at Cleveland - one each week this month!

                                   At President Bashford's.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--I came from Spiegel via Fostoria yester-

day morning to attend the Commencement here by listening to

the baccalaureate sermon of President Bashford today and

[taking part in] the meeting of the trustees tomorrow. I rose

before 6 A. M., and at six walked to the spring [and] drank a

tumbler of the best water in the world and now, 6:30 A. M., am

writing you.

  All were as usual at home. Spiegel never appeared better.

Webb is there a great deal, rebuilding the Carbon Works -a

slow business with the constant rains. I go tomorrow evening

to Columbus to a trustee meeting of the Ohio State University.

Wednesday evening I go to Gambier to be present Thursday on

the fiftieth anniversary of my graduation. Of my class, of nine

who graduated in 1842, seven are, I believe, living. An unusual

number after so long a time.  I will get home about Friday or

Saturday. The next week, Tuesday (28th), I go to a Loyal

Legion affair at Cleveland. Then a vacation for me of almost

a month!

  During that time I hope you can come to Spiegel and help me

"kill time"--a shameful phrase, as if we could want to murder

our best friend. I shall get off one idea at Kenyon- an old

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--Just home after exactly two weeks' ab-

sence in New England.  A pile of letters to notice.  Yours comes

first. I had a most happy but busy time in the heated term.

Fanny is in the Adirondacks for two to four weeks' stay with

her friend, Mrs. Dillenback, of New York.

   We have the Sixteenth Regiment this afternoon to entertain.

Mrs. Bristol helps us out.  I hope to be at home now for two

or three weeks.

  MY DEAR SCOTT: - All of the events of the 2d - the glorious

2d - passed off superbly - our reception, the celebration, Horace

Buckland's reception, etc.   Our guests were, General Force,

Mr. Lawrence, John Mitchell, etc. The others expected did not

turn up.  But it was a victory.

  I send you [the] last letter from Fanny.    Please return it.

  We look for Huntington this morning.

They missed not seeing you.    You are of more and more ac-

count in the family every day.     Don't get vain, but we are all

disposed to brag about you.

  It is the intention of Birch and Mary to dine with Fanny and

the old man on his birthday - Tuesday, 4th [of] October. These

presents are to notify you to come, if it is practicable.  If not

we will drink your health in strong coffee all the same, and you

can do the like by us if you think of it in the fine old smoky

city.

  Fanny and I expect to go to Mohonk and New York about the

7th to remain a week or ten days; thence home and I to Chicago

 on the 18th.          With all affection,

cago after a capital time with Fanny at Mohonk and New York

City, and with Fanny and Rud at Chicago.          The best things

were the whole affair at Mohonk, the naval parade at New York,

and the large building (the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Hall),

and the military parade in Washington  Park, Chicago.          The

roof of the big hall at Chicago covers largely more surface than

Spiegel Grove!    It is two hundred and six feet from floor to

roof.  It seats in its largest room  ninety thousand people!    It

grows on you as you observe it.  Stupendous is the adjective

that you must use. Filled with people - with cavalry, artillery,

infantry--it is august.

  We are all well and glad to be at home. I find your letter of

the 17th, for which thanks.

                        Affectionately,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SCOTT R. HAYES.

                                  SPIEGEL, October 31, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:-- I am again at home after a trip to Indian-

apolis to attend the funeral of Mrs. Harrison. The whole affair

at Indianapolis was tasty [tasteful] and impressive.       Indian-

apolis is a fine city with a strong healthy growth.      No other









<B>142          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



city without any navigable water is so large and prosperous. I

was the guest of a very interesting family--old friends of your

mother and of myself --Judge E. B. Martindale.       There are

several young men and daughters--all of whom are to be

specially remembered by the Hayes tribe.

  Your books have left at last.  We  were waiting for your

exact present address.  I hope they will find you sooner than

a consignment of magazines to a friendly library in Nashville.

They got to their destination in about four months!

  I enclose an invitation sent to you here.

  I saw Mrs. Herron in Columbus on my way home from Indian-

apolis.  She will probably visit Spiegel sometime next month,

November.

  Lilly's wedding with "Jim" will probably occur in December.

All peaceful here; except our favorite dog, Towser, was poisoned,

and a wheel of the carriage gave out - old age, fourteen years -

and we walk or go with "Pete" in a buggy.

                        Affectionately,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SCOTT R. HAYES.

                                SPIEGEL, November 8, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--We shall be particularly glad to greet you

and your friends on Thanksgiving day, and greatly disappointed

if you do not come. - All as usual.

                          Sincerely,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SCOTT R. HAYES.

                                SPIEGEL, December 16, 1892.

  MY DEAR SCOTT: - Thanks for your letter. I am too crowded

to write a letter.  All as usual.  We shall expect you here for

Christmas to meet the Trianglers--viz., Birch, Mary, and the

boys. If any change will tell you.

  "Excuse haste and a bad pen."

                        Your father,

                                   RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SCOTT R. HAYES.









             <B>NEARING THE END          143</B>



                                    SPIEGEL, January 1, 1893.

  MY DEAR SCOTT:--I am glad you like the idea of the watch.

It is all you have got yet, I believe. We will hunt up the reality

one of these days.  If we fail to find the intended watch I will

get you a new one. The intended watch was given to me by

Mother Webb on her death, September 14, 1866. I gave it to

Birchard and he carried it until I got Mr. Austin's fine watch on

his death in 1887, when Birchard handed his Mother Webb back

to me.

  Aunty Davis is, I fear, near death's door. You would do well

to call. (If she dies I will probably come to the funeral.)

  All here from Toledo today.     Too cold there for the young

folks. A happy time with them.

  The Kenyon affair [banquet at Cleveland] was enjoyable, but

my part of it was frivolous stuff. When you see my name, if

not mere abuse, send the scrap,  It saves me the trouble of a page

in the note-book- date and all.

  I expect a visit from Mrs. Herron this month; if not before,

[I] may come to Cincinnati after her.

                        Affectionately,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  SCOTT R. HAYES.



  January 8.  Sunday. - Heard a fair sermon by Presiding

Elder Barnes.

  I am a Christian according to my conscience in belief, not of

course in character and conduct, but in purpose and wish;--

not of course by the orthodox standard. But I am content, and

have a feeling of trust and safety.

  P. M. I drove with Rutherford around the grave of Lucy

in the sleigh. My feeling was one of longing to be quietly

resting in a grave by her side.

  January 9. Monday. 6 A. M. - I rise early to take the train

on Lake Erie and Wheeling for Columbus to attend the meet-

ing of the board of the university.









<B>144          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Let me be pure and wise and kind and true in all things!

  Reached Mitchell's at 12 noon. Called on Captain Cope.

  January 10.  Tuesday.--Presided at meeting of university

board. Present, Alexander, Chamberlain, Schueller, Wing, and

Hayes. The business was routine except the law school. We

finally proposed to have law lectures to the amount of fifteen

hundred dollars and some decrease of the amount paid Wilgus,

say six hundred dollars off,-- or twelve hundred dollars salary

hereafter.

  January 11.  Wednesday. - Still very cold.  Eight degrees

below zero. Dined with Rogers. A fine row of boys with him.

  We found the Fullertons in good case. Laura a beauty, her

sister Dorothy ditto. Evening, a talk with Rev. Mr. Jones, an

able, good man.

  January 12. Thursday. - Called with Cope on Governor Mc-

Kinley. Told him he was to make an address before the Agri-

cultural Convention at 10 A. M. The first notice! Committee

called for him. Soon over.

  About noon, train for Cleveland. Mr. Clark and other Cleve-

land men -- an agreeable party -- on "Big Four" to Cleveland.

Arrived about 4:30 P. M. 891 Prospect Street. A good time.

  January 13. Friday. - Eight above zero; a deep snow.

Called at the University School. Doing well.



  [The next day, Saturday, at the railway station in Cleveland,

as he was about to take the afternoon train for Fremont, Mr.

Hayes was suddenly attacked with angina pectoris. The acute

pain was somewhat relieved by brandy, quickly administered by

his son Webb, and the journey home was made without increase

of suffering. Medical attention awaited him at home, where he

was glad at once to take to his bed -- which he was never more

to leave. Dr. Hilbish, who did everything possible to medical

skill, did not at first apprehend a fatal termination of the malady.

But Mr. Hayes felt that his hour was fast approaching. His









             <B>DEATH JANUARY 17, 1893          145</B>



worn and weary system did not respond to curative remedies.

Tuesday night (January 17, 1892) near eleven o'clock, his noble

spirit passed peacefully into the eternal mystery of the Unseen.

Mr. Hayes's last recorded words were: "I know that I am

going where Lucy is."]
