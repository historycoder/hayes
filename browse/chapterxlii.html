NOVEMBER 4. Tuesday. -- A steady warm rain; a

       gloomy, cloudy day.  The Presidential election day.  It

has been commonly said that bad weather helps the Democrats.

There is not much in it. A wet day drives the drinkers to the

bottle. They are likely to be more reckless and riotous. In this

way the Republicans may suffer a little. But the notion that the

Republicans will be more likely to be kept from voting by bad

weather is without foundation.

  I go to Cincinnati today to attend tomorrow the monthly meet-

ing of the Loyal Legion.  I have not attended since June--five

months. My longest absence since the commandery was organ-

ized.  Its merits are:--1. It is a social club.  Its frequent

meetings lead to great intimacy of friendship among its members.

2. It is a historical society. This idea will be more and more de-

veloped as the society gets older and stronger. 3. It is an army

or soldiers' reunion, with all the attractions belonging [to] that

form of social gathering. 4. It is permanent beyond ordinary

clubs. The society of the Cincinnati after a century of existence

still has interesting meetings.

  There are two things I would change:--1. The primogeni-

ture feature is not American, is unjust to the younger sons and,

perhaps I should say, daughters. 2. All honorably discharged

soldiers should be eligible to membership.

  This [is] the birthday of our oldest son, Birchard. He is

thirty-one years old today. He was interesting and beautiful as

a child and has grown up to be a man of excellent character and

habits, with many very attractive qualities.





                              CINCINNATI, November 5, 1884.

   MY DARLING: -- It now seems probable that Blaine is defeated.

With all the disappointment, one can see some compensations.

It turns out, not as we hoped, but as we feared at the time of

the nomination.   The record of our candidate and  factional

griefs in New York lost that State. Look at Oneida County --

the county of Conkling, where Gail Hamilton's letter (exposed

in the Evening Post a short time ago) did such mischief. In-

deed, her letters in the Tribune hurt more than the number of

votes we lack in New York. I dread the turning back of the

hands of the clock in the Southern business and in the reform of

the civil service. I am glad Ohio has done so well. But, after

all, the march of events will go on. Our destiny does not de-

pend on a single election, nor on any number of elections. You

will see other sources of consolation.

  Do not borrow trouble from what I said to you in our ride

in the rain. We will be more and more loving, hopeful, and

trusting as life wears away. Ever so much happiness be yours

--be ours -- and ours together.

                      As ever, "s' much,"

                                                RUTHERFORD.

  Later!--It now looks as if Blaine would pull through.

  MRS. HAYES.





  November 9. Sunday.--I returned last evening. The eve-

ning of the 4th, the national election day, I reached friend Her-

ron's about 7 P. M. and was warmly welcomed by sister Harriet

and all. We soon (John W. and I) left the house to get the news.

Ohio had evidently largely increased its October majority, and

our interest and inquiries were as to the doubtful States, particu-

larly New York. This great State if for us would, in our judg-

ment, settle things conclusively, and if against us would be









<B>174          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



nearly equally decisive.  We  went through Fountain Square.

Vast multitudes there were watching the bulletin board of Mab-

ley's clothing store. We soon heard bad news from Connecticut

and then a Democratic claim of sixty thousand in New York.

Wild, but not encouraging. After spending a few moments in

the crowds on Fifth, Vine, Sixth, and Seventh, we went to the

office of the Commercial-Gazette. We were invited to Halstead's

room, and were soon in his sanctum.  We three, with the addition

of Hinkle, son-in-law of William H. Davis, spent two or three

hours very pleasantly, receiving returns and in listening to Hal-

stead's snappy talk. The result left all in doubt with the chances

apparently against us.  We reached our beds about 11 or 12 P.

M. The next day a change came. Blaine's prospects were for

a time better, but New York was too close for confidence as to

the result, and this still continues with varying fortunes. Last

night still in doubt with chances leaning--how? The Blaine

reports, 522 [plurality] for Blaine, and the Democratic reports,

100 to 500 for Cleveland.

  [On the] 6th, attended the elegant Murphy wedding and met

and enjoyed meeting many old friends. I knew well the grand-

fathers of bride and [bride]groom.

  [On the] 7th, at Columbus, attended Lilly's coming-out party.

All lovely. Emily Hastings was the beauty of the evening. The

party was given by General and Mrs. Hastings and Ruther-

ford H. Platt in the old home. All went off in the best possible

way.

  November 10. Monday. -- The County Bible Society met at

the office of Dr. Wilson at 10 A. M.  Organization continued.

  The unsettled contest in New York still furnishes the prevail-

ing topic of conversation. I discover no excitement.





                        FREMONT, OHIO, November 10, 1884.

  MADAM:--Your letter to Mrs. Hayes is before me.  I was

absent from home when it came or it would have been replied to

before.

  I wrote Buckner that I would pay fifty dollars towards the









             <B>ELECTION OF CLEVELAND          175</B>



support of Eliza Jane the coming year. I have had no reply from

him. As to the debts of Eliza Jane, I can only say that when I

know the total amount, I will be able to say how much I will give

towards paying them. You probably know how much I have al-

ready given on that account.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. WINNIE BUCKNER,

    Windsor, Ontario.



  November 11.--I have been taking an ugly cold.  I cough

and sneeze as if the hay-fever had attacked me. I rode with

Lucy and Mrs. Bristol down to Mr. Ickes', east side of the river,

on some church charity Lucy is interested [in]. They were all

cheerful and liberal.

  We passed the ox-roasting of the Democrats in State Street

near our old corner stores at Front and State [Streets]. The

crowd was quiet. There has been little genuine enthusiasm for

Cleveland in this region. Indeed, I may say, none at all. The

dark blot on his private life does not imply entire unfitness for

his public life. Many a man is blamable in the same way who

is upright and patriotic. But the facts taken all together have

been a wet blanket to his supporters. The nomination of Blaine

was unwise. Either of the Shermans, Hawley, or Gresham, or

Harrison would probably have been elected.





                              FREMONT, November 13, 1884.

  DEAR GUY:-- . . . I have no prejudices against Cleve-

land. The scandals of the campaign were shocking. In naming

a candidate there should be greater care. But you and I know,

all men of experience and observation know, that the kernel of

truth under it all does not disqualify him for public duties. It

is within the knowledge of us all that integrity, firmness, wis-

dom, and the executive faculty, with the truest patriotism, are

found in men who are not without that sin. Certainly, I am in a

frame of mind to judge him charitably and to give his Adminis-









<B>176          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tration a fair trial. He is pledged to the right side of the most

important administrative policy now before the country, viz., the

civil service reform.  He will have a decided majority on this

question in the important branch of Congress with him and can

easily go forward in the right direction.

   The  Republican party is not condemned.         It has its old

strength. Both parties were divided by their nominations. The

Republican divisions by a mere scratch in the pivotal State lost

the prize. It [the Republican party] gains in both houses of

Congress; it carries the Senate and would tie the House if the

apportionment in this and other States was [were] fair.  The

constitutional amendments if obeyed would have given us four

to six States in the South and carried the Presidency. But it is

of no use to argue.  The stream of time flows on; the march of

events will not be greatly changed.  The people are the govern-

ment. Their character does not change with the results of elec-

tions. Years and generations are required to change the people.

I hope you are for aid to education in the States by the Nation.

It seems to be our best chance to bring up the neglected elements

of our population.

  This is a longer talk than usual on politics. Like you, I am a

looker-on except as to education. On that, I am persistent, in and

out of season, before all sorts of audiences.

  Your trouble is mine--acres,  taxes, meagre  income.        But

lands will sell sometime. I do not borrow trouble because just

now real estate is dull of sale.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.





  November 17. -- Sent a barrel of apples to Aunty Davis and

another to Harriet Herron.  Largely of apples grown on trees

set out in 1876. Belleflowers and Greenings.

Private.

Please return this hasty scrawl. -- H.

                        FREMONT, OHIO, November 25, 1885.

  DEAR SIR:--Having definitely retired from political life, I

have no opinions for publication on the questions suggested in

your esteemed favor of the 22d instant. While, to my mind, the

meagre vote given at the recent election (in Ohio less than one

in seventy) in favor of political action in regard to temperance

is a significant and perhaps controlling fact, I am not disposed

to debate the question with those who do not agree with me.

With me, unity of sentiment and action among all sincere friends

of temperance is of more importance than the particular meas-

ure or course of action to be adopted. As I see it, the mistake of

these last few years has been the neglect by temperance workers

of the essential preliminary labor which the situation demands.

  In this country popular opinion and the public will are the

only government. To form and settle these is the real task of

the reformer. Politics and laws are merely results -- merely the

expression of what the people wish. Or, rather, this is what

should be. The will of the people depends on education, religion,

example, discussion, and the like. Whoever neglects these forces,

and attempts to call in the constable to do the duty which belongs

to the reformer, puts the cart before the horse. As long as pub-

lic opinion tolerates the practice of the moderate drinker who

buys of, and thereby makes profit for, the liquor dealer, the

traffic will continue--law or no law.  The buyer is the respon-

sible cause of the evil. Get rid of him, in that large degree,

which is entirely practicable by proper effort, and laws will

speedily follow which will bring relief from the rest of the re-

sults we deplore, so far at least as laws can suppress crime.

  The practical result of this view is, for the present let the

politician and lawmaker well alone. Their masters -- the people

-- by a few years of solid work on the lines I have indicated

can be reached. With the people sound on the main question,

you need have no apprehension as to what political parties and

legislatures will do.       Sincerely,

  [Unidentified.]                                R. B. HAYES.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, December 1, 1884.

  MY DEAR SIR:--On the request of our Monumental Associa-

tion I have just written to General Hawley requesting him to

deliver the address at the unveiling of our Soldiers' Monument

August 2, the anniversary of Croghan's victory over the British

in 1813. The monument is to be on the site of the old fort. I

have referred General Hawley to you for a knowledge of the

local facts. We are exceedingly anxious that General Hawley

should come. Please aid us in persuading him to do so.

  Of course Mrs. Hayes and I wish you and Mrs. Sherman to be

with us on the occasion. We shall have a great multitude here

as we always do when we try.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



  December 7. Sunday. -- Lucy and I returned from Delaware

last night. A charming visit Lucy had with her old schoolmate,

the widow of my college chum, Carrie Little (Mrs. Dr. John A.

Little).  Rode with Judge Jones around town--up the river to

a sight of the old farm of boyhood with its host of associations

with Mother, Fanny, Uncle, and the early friends!

  Reaching home after this delightful time, we were saddened

to read in a paper sent by Governor Ramsay, of St. Paul, of the

death of his wife.  Such good people!  Our Washington life

associated us with many elderly people. Their deaths are coming

to us constantly. None better than this good governor.

  December 8. Monday.--I start this evening for New York,

chiefly to enable Mr. D. Huntington to finish my portrait for the

White House, but with important business with [the] Adams

Express Company, William M. F. Round, William E. Dodge,

Jr., Charles L. Mead, Carl Schurz, Ralph Trautman, [and] Wil-

liam M. Evarts.



                             NEW YORK, December 9, 1884.

  MY DARLING:--I arrived this evening precisely on time, 7

P. M., at the Grand Central Depot after an unusually agreeable









             <B>ELECTION OF CLEVELAND          179</B>



trip of twenty-four hours from Fremont. My chief acquaintance

on the way was the vice-president of the Lake Erie and Western,

a citizen of Bloomington. He is intelligent, interesting, and cor-

dial, and made the day seem short. The inevitable interviewer,

in the shape of a well-looking attache of the Syracuse Journal,

gave up his brief attack after a pleasant fashion.

  Mr. Arkell, one of the proprietors of the Albany Evening Jour-

nal, gave me a full account of the political situation here. Evarts

hasn't money enough for a New York Legislature, and L. P.

Morton has; hence Morton is first in the race for Senator. Conk-

ling not seriously thought of. Cleveland a dull, honest, well-mean-

ing, and very stubborn man who is likely to be a pretty good

President.  So much for Mr. Arkell.  He introduced me to his

partner, a Mr. Smith, who is his father's partner in making wheat

bags for the West at Canajoharie and who was in college with

Rud, whom he compliments as "very gentlemanly."

  I am in my old quarters (41 and 42) and look out on a clear

and lovely winter evening.

  So good night, my dear one. Be happy. You will be good I

know without advice. Love to our niece, Rud, and the girls.

                  Sincerely and affectionately,

                                                        R. B.

  MRS. HAYES.



  December 10.  Fifth Avenue Hotel. -- Called on Mr. Hunting-

ton at his residence and studio, 49 East Twentieth Street. He

painted an hour and a half on the portrait for the White House.

It seems good in all respects.  The expression is almost fierce;

perhaps I should say, too earnest. But I must admit its truth-

fulness to the original. I do not quite like the overcoat. It does

not fit well, hangs loosely and does not come up neatly to the

neck.  In the main and on the whole, the portrait is good.

  Called on Schurz at the elegant residence of Dr. Jacobi, 110

West Thirty-fourth Street. A long good conversation on politics.

He read me an elaborate letter he has written, on request, to the

President elect. It asserts civil service reform to be the test

measure of the new Administration. That to carry it out Cleve-









<B>180          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



land must have in his leading Cabinet places men who will be

sincerely honest in its behalf. I told him there was the practical

difficulty--there are not such men of good standing in the party.

To this Schurz assented. Then pledge them to its loyal support?

Here is the rub.

  Huntington says Governor Morgan, explaining his defeat of

Evarts for governor or senator, said:--"Mr. Evarts can't hold

his tongue. That is one of my accomplishments."

  Met at table Mr. and Mrs. Fairbrother, of Providence.  Much

pleasant talk of our delightful visit there. "No one has occupied

the house you did before or since. Can't have such a time now."

Also Governor Van Zant, of Newport, and General Gordon.

[At] 9 P. M. called at Mead's, 60 East Seventy-ninth Street.

Found there Mr. and Mrs. Mead. Good, kind, and friendly;

genuine people always. And Fred just returned from two years

in Mexico.



                           NEW YORK, December 12, 1884.

  MY DARLING:--I dined at Mr. Evarts' last evening. All very

cordial. They really want you to visit them. Betty and her two

boys make a lovely group.

  Mrs. Parsons and Mr. Parsons send love to you, and Mrs.

Reid and Rachel Sherman were warmly enthused talking about

you. You managed to put a good many people into a happy

frame of mind.

  Huntington's portrait of me grows rapidly. It is very fine--

far better than any ever painted before.  Mr. Huntington is

greatly pleased with it. Will show it [at] a great exhibition here

in January.             Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES.





  December 15.  Monday.--Replied to a host of letters.  De-

clined invitations of New England Societies of Brooklyn and New

York, of New Orleans World's Fair, Mount Union College, etc.,

etc., etc., and reserved decision on Decoration Day at Ripley.









             <B>NATIONAL AID TO EDUCATION          181</B>



  December 18. Thursday.--During the great storm on Lake

Erie a few days ago the water of the lake was driven into Buffalo,

doing a good deal of damage. Here the river was a mere brook

almost down to the island. The riffles were a long distance be-

low the bridge.

  December 19. Friday. -- Last night I was with the building

committee of our church until long after 10 o'clock, examining

bids for seating our church. Seven gentlemen with large trunks

were there with samples from three States. Let [the contract]

to a Richmond, Indiana, party represented by Mr. Grant for six

hundred and ninety dollars--604 feet of circular pews.

  December 23.  Tuesday. -- I go today to Toledo to meet Mrs.

Hally Ballinger, her daughter Laura, and the son of my class-

mate, Bryan, young Guy M. I have not seen Mrs. Ballinger

since the winter of 1848-9 when she was the belle of the Brazos

in Texas.

  December 25.  Thursday.--Merry Christmas!  Present for

the day Birch, Webb, Rud, Fanny, Scott, my old friend

William K. Rogers, who came in at the Christmas eve supper,

Mrs. William P. Ballinger, of Texas, her son Thomas, a sopho-

more at Ann Arbor, Laura her daughter, [and] Guy Bryan, son

of my old college friend. With all these the old folks got on

nicely during the festive day.

  December 30, 1884.  Tuesday.--Our wedding!  Thirty-two

years ago. A happy life. Fine children, a dear wife.

  I am daily writing to Members of Congress in behalf of the

bill in aid of education by the general Government. There is a

good deal of hope among its friends. But--

  December 31. -- Soldiers' Monument and letters on the educa-

tion bill were the office work of the day. -- Finished Mrs. Stowe's

"Wife and I" with Lucy. A novel of good influence.

  January 4, 1885.  Sunday. -- Heard the Presiding Elder, Rev.

Mr. Whitlock, [on] the permanency of the Christian religion.

Sent copies of Curry's letter to the Richmond Dispatch and the

editorial of the Dispatch to Democratic Members of Congress

from Ohio.  It is reprinted in our Democratic Messenger.









<B>182          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Reading Professor Fiske's books, two of Mrs. Stowe's novels,

viz., "My Wife and I," and "We and Our Neighbors," and

Parkman's "Montcalm and Wolfe" finished. Reading it with

the young folks, Fanny and Scott. I go this week to Cincinnati

to attend the monthly meeting of the Loyal Legion; next week to

New York to attend a meeting of the Slater Board.

  January 8. -- The spire of the new great Catholic church of

Father Bauer is two hundred and fifty feet and two inches high

-- almost as high as Trinity, New York, and one of the highest in

the country.





                          FREMONT, OHIO, January 5, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I notice with very great pleasure your com-

ments on the letter of Mr. Cleveland on the reform of the civil

service. I have for some time past indulged the hope that the

President elect would be found a sincere friend of the cause.

Confiding in his good faith as I do, it is a satisfaction to find

that you also, with your excellent opportunities to know the truth,

believe in him.  He has it in his power to establish the reform.

All its friends should do what they can to sustain him. They

should not be too exacting.  He must put in his Cabinet men

who hitherto have not been reformers. There will be short-

comings. Men under him will adhere to the old practices. But

he has many advantages. This is his only question of difficulty.

How great an advantage this is, no one knows better than I do.

With the cheap-money craze and the bloody-shirt policy on my

hands at the same time with the first attempt to rescue the civil

service from party leaders, the situation in 1877 differed widely

from that which is now to be dealt with.

  Passing from this, when I met you in October, you spoke

kindly of my services in this behalf. There is a disposition on

the part of some friends of the cause to disparage my work. I

have no disposition to complain of this, or to attempt to correct

misapprehensions in any public way. But regarding you as the

great leader in this reform, as the one man to whom the









             <B>WORK FOR CIVIL SERVICE REFORM          183</B>



country is indebted for what has been done, more than to all

others, I am particularly gratified by your approval of what was

done by me. I have been in the habit of thinking of my work

as including three steps in advance:--

  1. "Senatorial prerogative" and "Congressional patronage,"

under the spoils system, had become the common law of our po-

litical system. This practice of more than forty years' growth

was firmly and successfully resisted.

  2. The control by the Executive of the whole body of office-

holders as a political force to do his bidding in party manage-

ment, was absolutely and entirely abolished during my term of

office. Office-holders either abstained entirely from such work,

or took their own course without any effort to dictate on the part

of the Executive. In the National Convention of 1880, a smaller

number of office-holders took part than in any previous conven-

tion since the time of John Quincy Adams. It was in striking

contrast with the convention of 1884, in which the office-holders

appeared in full force supporting the interests of the Adminis-

tration under which they held place.

  3. Perhaps the most important service to the cause rendered

by the last Administration was [what was done in] the

great[est  business]  office in the country.     The  New  York

Custom House had been [the] most powerful political par-

tisan  agency  under  the  spoils  system.     Here  the  reform

was  most needed and  most difficult.       If the reform  could

be established here, its practicability everywhere was dem-

onstrated.    Under  General  Merritt,  by  the  judgment  of

friend and  foe alike, the principles  of  the reform  of  the

civil service were carried out so successfully that it may be truly

said that the corner-stone of the reform was then and there laid.

  In response to all of this, I do not wish a word from you for

present publication.  But it would be gratifying to have in writ-

ing the substance of what you said to me when we last met in

New York.<B>*</B>

                                 SPIEGEL, January 14, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--Your letter carried off--not yet returned--

but I think the vital point was horsewomanship. Yes, do by all

my [?] means.  Learn all the graces and essentials--the orna-

mental and useful parts of the accomplishment. It is worth more

than Greek. You write a charming little letter. Try to enlarge

a little. Be discursive, give wings to your imagination. Indulge

in a few long sentences. Tell us in a poetical way, or a humor-

ous way, or an impressive way, some of the facts -- some of the

secrets of your environment.

  We are all as we were. Fine winter weather. I go to New

York tomorrow. Will return in a few days.

  All love you.

                      Your affectionate

  MISS FANNY HAYES.



               NEW YORK, Friday evening, January 16, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--After a very pleasant trip, I am here on time.

Reverend Dr. Curry and his wife (the editor of the Methodist

Episcopal Advocate) were returning from a three-weeks' absence

at Delaware and Chicago. We had a long talk on the topics

naturally arising, and especially many things were said you

would particularly like to hear, which therefore I forbear to give.

  At Albany the members [of the Legislature] came on the train,

having adjourned until Monday. Monday night is the senatorial









             <B>EVARTS BECOMES SENATOR          185</B>



caucus. The friends of Mr. Evarts were in high spirits. They

regard the battle as won. I talked with a number of them, and

also of the Evarts committees. All see it clearly for Mr. Evarts.

I talked with two anti-Evarts members (both of whom sent re-

gards to you, by-the-by,) viz., Senator Daggett, of Brooklyn, and

General Barnum, of this city.  They were down, but said, "wait

for the vote."  General McCook  never looked better-no appear-

ance of intemperance.  He was exceedingly happy and cordial--

will take me to church to hear Paxton Sunday.

  As usual I met acquaintance of Rud and Webb -- Este, a den-

tist in Ithaca. His father is a senator and for Mr. Evarts.

  In short this seems to be our victory. If it is a victory, as now

seems likely, he takes the seat Conkling left in a huff, and to do

it beats Arthur and the Stalwarts.

                With all love from yours ever,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.





  January 18.  Sunday.--Leaving home Thursday evening at

7 P. M., I reached here (Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York) about

6:30 P. M. Friday, to attend a special meeting of the Slater

Board. All present except the Chief Justice. We had a full talk

over the whole business. The meeting while not fruitful in pres-

ent practical results was, I am sure, useful. Our records show

the action taken. Governor Colquitt wished the next meeting

held at his city, Atlanta, Georgia, and invited Mrs. Hayes and

myself to visit his home.

  At Albany the recess of the Legislature till Monday

filled  our  train.  I  was  greatly  pleased  to  learn  from

all that Evarts was likely to win the Senatorship--that

it  was  almost  a  certainty.      General   McCook,    General

Barnum, Daggett (Albert), and other members were very cordial.

My most agreeable talk was with Dr. and Mrs. Curry--Dr.

Curry of the New York Advocate.  Lunched at University Club

with Jesup, Dr. Brooks, and others of our board, Saturday at

noon.

  Saturday evening called at Mr. Evarts' and congratulated them









<B>186          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



on the probable election of Mr. Evarts as Senator from New

York. It is to me a special satisfaction. Mr. Evarts and his

family have been valued and warm friends of me and mine ever

since we became acquainted in 1877. He was at the head of my

Cabinet; was the leading advocate of my cause before the Elec-

toral Commission; was with me thoroughly in the whole South-

ern policy, and in the fight with Conkling and with Arthur and

Cornell. His election to the seat resigned in a pet by the self-

conceited "monomaniac on the subject of his own importance"

is a condemnation of Conkling. It is a defeat of Arthur and his

set and of Cornell and puts New York against Tilden in the Sen-

ate. All gratifying as political lessons and [as a] vindication of

my Administration. In the work my old and near friend Mc-

Cook leads.

  I took supper with William E. Dodge, Jr., Saturday night. A

pleasant visit with Haygood to a good, wholesome, and charm-

ing family.

  Sunday I saw General James and Warner Miller. Went with

McCook to hear Paxton (a Washington preacher). He gave us

a tonic like a bracing breeze from a mountain top--a needed

tonic everywhere and by us all.

  I go this afternoon with William E. Dodge, Jr., and Haygood

to see various good works.

  January 19, 1885. -- I called with President Gilman on General

Grant. Soon after we were seated in his parlor I heard the gen-

eral's voice upstairs saying: "Fred, General Hayes is in the par-

lor. Go down and see him." Soon Colonel Fred came down, and

in a moment I heard the general's voice again: "Badeau, Gen-

eral Hayes is in the parlor. Come down and see him"; and in

a moment after General Grant came in, very lame, but otherwise

looking well. He said he felt much better than he had been;

that he had walked some distance that day notwithstanding the

cold wind; that in December he had a number of teeth pulled

and the shock was too great, and his nervous system had been

injured; that for two weeks also his tongue was sore and gave

him much pain. He had scarcely been able to speak. He spoke

of reading General Force's book, "From Donelson to Shiloh"









             <B>CALL ON GENERAL GRANT          187</B>



["From Fort Henry to Corinth"], as an authority of value. He

spoke easily and cheerfully, but he did not smile!





                           FREMONT, OHIO, January 21, 1885.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I returned from New York last eve-

ning and find here your note. I will be glad if Major Blivens

can give us a paper and will write him to that effect. As we go

to Cincinnati the time when should be not earlier than the 14th.

That date or any time later will suit us.

  Your "Cedar Creek" made me happy. It was and is the best

thing on a famous fight.

  I called with President Gilman, of the Johns Hopkins Univer-

sity, on General Grant. He has been very sick. He had a number of

teeth drawn -- the shock was too severe; he also took a cold, and

with a difficulty at the root of his tongue was scarcely able to

speak for some days. He is now almost as well as before. He

looks well; was attentive and cordial; and talked with interest

of war matters. I mentioned the piece I enclose. This led him to

speak in a way that led me to think he was just from his war

sketches.  He  spoke of reading now Force's book, etc., etc.

Colonel Fred Grant and Badeau were present.  The conversation

was lively and pleasant, but he did not strike me as cheerful.

Simply composed and considerate. Of course, this is solely for

you. I am confident the danger is past with him. This scrap

appeared in the Tribune Monday.  He was interested in my ac-

count of it.

  The election of Evarts is a great gratification.  It covers a

world of points of personal interest to me, and is a public good.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL J. M. COMLY.



  January 22.  Thursday. -- Attended with Lucy the Farmers'

Institute. Led by Secretary of State Board of Agriculture,

Hon. W. I. Chamberlain, and Gould. Good practical lectures on

farmers' topics were delivered.  This is essentially an educa-









<B>188          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tional process. I spoke a few minutes in the evening on my edu-

cational hobbies; viz.:--1. Teach more of American history

and biography, 2. Teach more of English language and litera-

ture and modern languages, 3. Industrial education.





                     CINCINNATI, Monday, February 2, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--Your mother and I are having one of our

best visits. Nothing could be better-timed. We have attended

agreeable gatherings at Mr. Broadwell's, Mr. Bullock's, General

Force's, and in the beautiful Odeon we heard Sala twice. We

go riding and visiting daily. We remain until Thursday eve-

ning, when we expect to go via the Bee Line to Cleve-

land, arriving Friday morning. Will stay in Cleveland long

enough to see our charming daughter (!) and go home

Friday night after almost two weeks' absence. Let Webb know

our plans so we may at least see his honest face.

  We are at Herron's, but will spend the Loyal Legion days,

Wednesday and Thursday, at the Burnet House.

  Our love to the Austin household, and several solid chunks

for yourself from your mother (who admires her daughter more

than ever) and your paternal who has no prejudice against you.

                          Lovingly,

                                                        H.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Cleveland.



  February 7, 1885.--We reached home last evening about 5

P. M. via Cleveland, Wellington, and Norwalk from Cincinnati,

where we remained about two weeks; the longest and best visit

to Cincinnati we have had since we left to reside here in the

spring of 1873. . . .

  Our Harvester Company makes an assignment next week.

They make a good machine, but the early management was un-

fortunate. Besides, the small fish are eaten up by the big ones.

Uncle had five thousand dollars stock. I signed certain notes.

My loss will hardly exceed ten thousand dollars, and will not be









             <B>DEVOTION TO LOYAL LEGION          189</B>



less than five thousand dollars.  Besides this, the savings bank

question comes to a decision next week. If it is adverse we

shall have trouble and possibly some losses with our new savings

bank. "It never rains but it pours."

  February 8.  Sunday. -- My most agreeable visit to Cincinnati

was chiefly to attend the annual dinner (the second) of the Ohio

Commandery of the Loyal Legion. It passed off gloriously.

Lucy had a beautiful and numerously attended reception at the

Burnet House. The banquet was superb. Fine speaking by

Bishop Fallon, Gibson, Murdock, and others.

  I naturally think of the history and origin of our prototype,

"The Society of the Cincinnati." I find "some account" of it

by Alex Johnston in volume 6, Historical Society of Pennsyl-

vania. Meeting to form society on banks of the Hudson (near

or at Newburgh), May 10, 1783.

  A rough draft of proposals for the society was drawn up by

General Knox, April 15, 1783, at West Point; offered to the

meeting at Newburgh, May 10, referred to a committee -- Knox,

Hand, Huntington, and Captain Shaw, -- reported on the 13th

to an adjourned meeting and adopted as the constitution of the

order.

  At the first general meeting of the order of the Cincinnati,

action was taken, abolishing (so far as that general meeting was

concerned) the hereditary principle and the power of electing

honorary members. At the general meeting in May 1784 the in-

stitution changing the rule of the order as to the hereditary fea-

ture and as to honorary members, was adopted -- twelve States

for it and one divided, viz., New York.







                          FREMONT, OHIO, February 8, 1885.

  DEAR AUNTY D--: -- I send you the narrative of Massy Har-

beson. Keep it till I come down sometime. Coe's Station is

mentioned in it a number of times. I do not see any other book

that contains important mention of it.  Your town was Taren-

tum, if I remember aright.









<B>190          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I thought there were no Indian troubles on the Allegheny after

the close of the Revolutionary War in 1783. In this I was mis-

taken. They lasted some ten years later.

  We found all well and glad to see us here. -- With best wishes

to yourself and Doctor.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. EILZA G. DAVIS,

    Cincinnati.





  February 9.  Monday. -- All day at work on correspondence.

Read Holmes' article in Atlantic -- entertaining as always. "De-

terioration and Race Education," by Samuel Royce, contains

much food for reflection.  Too much stress on "race," and yet

--Do races tend downwards after reaching a high civilization?



Personal.

                              FREMONT, February 10, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- It will be somewhat inconvenient to attend

the dedication on the 21st instant. I had not intended, by rea-

son of other engagements, to be present. But seeing the promi-

nent place in the programme given to ex-Presidents, in view of my

active interest in the [Washington] Monument, and thinking of

what is due to the Father of his Country, I am not sure but I

ought to come.  Please write me confidentially on the subject.

Will General Grant be present?

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    Washington, D. C.



                        SPIEGEL GROVE, February 10, 1885.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -- I want to mention a fact which I forgot

yesterday. (Confidentially.) The dedication of the Washington

Monument takes place February 21. I did not know all the facts

until this moment. The ex-Presidents have a place (prominent









             <B>NO DOUBT OF LOUISIANA VOTE          191</B>



of course) in all parts of the programme. My engagement with

you is prior to that. I can well plead it for my absence. But

on reflection, possibly I ought to go to Washington.  If so, can

the Toledo Loyal Legion postpone until [the] 28th their com-

ing here?

  I think this is the whole case. I am sorry I had not seen the

programme at Washington when I phoned you yesterday.

                 "Same as before." Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL J. M. COMLY.





  February 12.  Thursday.--I just sent to George T. Rock-

well, Kalamazoo, Michigan, who wanted an autograph sentiment,

the following:

  "The capital defect of our public schools is too much teaching,

too little educating, and too little manual labor. The Spartan

rule was: 'Teach boys what they will practice when they become

men.'"

  February 16.  Monday.--I have just written to the District

Attorney of Dakota, Hon. Hugh Campbell, one of the Republi-

cans who stood by the Republican count in Louisiana in 1876,

(extract):--

  "I have never had any doubt as to the legality or the fairness of

the final result in 1876. Garfield, Sherman, and other gentlemen

of high character, who visited Louisiana to observe the count,

personally assured me in the strongest terms that my equitable

as well as legal right to the vote of that State was beyond all

question. More than this, one of the ablest and most influential

Democrats in the country, who was perfectly familiar with the

inner history of the whole affair on the Democratic side, told

me that no intelligent or candid man of his party could claim

the election for the Democratic party if he conceded the validity

of the Fifteenth Amendment. Said he, 'If the negro vote is en-

titled to be considered, you should have had more States than

were counted for you.' No doubt this is true."









<B>192          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Private.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, February 16, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am obliged for your letter. It gives me

the situation as I wanted to know it. Urgent private business

requires my presence here for the next ten days or two weeks.

I could only go to Washington in case the proprieties REQUIRE it.

I send you a short official declination. If anything occurs to

make it necessary for me to come, a dispatch will bring me to

Washington. It should reach me not later than Thursday noon.

  With special thanks for your kind attention,

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                        FREMONT, OHIO, February 16, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I regret that it is not practicable for me to

accept the invitation to attend the ceremonies at the dedication

of the Washington Monument on the 21st instant.

  When the work of the monument was resumed under the Act

of 1876, as a member of the commission in charge of it, I was

much interested in the plan for strengthening the foundation rec-

ommended by the engineer, General Casey, and have ever since

watched with deep solicitude the progress of the structure to-

wards completion. It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to

congratulate General Casey and his associates, that after so

many anxious years of devotion to their task, they are now

gladdened by the successful termination of their skilful and

hazardous labors.

  The fame of Washington needs no monument. No work of

human hands can adequately illustrate his character and services.

His countrymen, however, wishing to manifest their admiration

and gratitude, a hundred years ago decided to build a monument

in honor of his deeds and virtues. Having undertaken the work

they could not neglect it or allow it to fail.  The friends of lib-

erty and good government in all other lands will unite with patri-









             <B>THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT          193</B>



otic Americans in rejoicing that a monument so fitting and majes-

tic has now been erected in memory of Washington.

                          Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    CHAIRMAN.



          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, February 16, 1885.

  MY DEAR GUY:--The pecans have never come to hand. My

son Rud has undertaken to look them up. I am sorry you took

so much trouble with them. I intended to plant a number of

them, and see what could be done with them here.

  We enjoyed the visit of the Texas colony, and am glad if they

found it homelike.

  I am very busy just now. The long continued hard times

have brought embarrassment to two enterprises in which I am

interested, and for some time to come I must give their affairs

personal attention.

  I do not apprehend serious embarrassment of my affairs, but

shall be somewhat straitened for a time.-- All well.

                     As ever, sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.



  February 22. Sunday.--Our church is substantially completed.

Cost about twenty thousand dollars. Amount actually collected

over nine thousand dollars. Due on subscriptions deemed good

about three thousand dollars. To be raised about eight thousand

dollars. The dedication ceremonies will be next Sunday. At that

time it is hoped that a considerable part of this will be raised.

Considering the hard times, the recent failure of the Harvester

Company, and the fact that the congregation embraces very few

wealthy people, I shall be content if we raise enough to reduce

our debt to five thousand dollars. I pay one-fourth of all that is

raised. The structure is a good one and quite equal in all re-

spects to my expectations.

  February 23. Monday.--I am vexed to find that our bank

still holds greatly too large an amount of paper that is substan-

tially one concern. . . . This debt has been carried along

with the notes of its partners several years. I was much dis-

turbed about it when [I] first learned of it after my return from

Washington. . . . I hope by careful attention the bank can

get out of it without serious loss. But I must keep my eye on

it and see that all is done that can now be done. There is dan-

ger.

  February 24. Tuesday.--At noon today we got a dispatch

from our lawyer at Columbus, Honorable Richard A. Harrison,

that the Supreme Court sustains the constitutionality of the Sav-

ings Bank Law. This is a relief.

  February 25. Wednesday. -- To Cleveland to attend a meeting

of the trustees of the Western Reserve University. The chief

business related to the Medical Department and the graduation

of over fifty young men. At Austin's found all in usual health.

  In the afternoon I rode with him, Miss Mattie [Avery], and

Sister Fanny out to the powder mill to see a gas well recently

dug by Mr. Austin at an expense of some eleven hundred dollars.

He went down seven hundred feet and over. The first seventy

feet with an eight-inch pipe, the cost was two dollars per foot.

Cheaper afterwards as the pipe diminished. In the shale he

soon began to find gas. At three hundred to four hundred feet

he found perhaps the full supply he now has. Mr. Austin esti-

mates the heat of the supply he now has as worth or equal to two

tons of coal per day. This is a guess. The flame is several feet

high out of a two-inch pipe. How to put it out was a question.

By running the pipe up for several feet and removing a section

rapidly for several feet below the orifice the flame is cut off.

  In the evening with Webb and the ladies to the riding school

and armory of the Troop. Fanny is delighted with riding. She

is full of life and spirit and as engaging and lovable as one can

wish. Dear girl!

  February 27. Friday.--The new church being done the funeral

sermon of Father Israel Smith was preached in it (its first use)

and the remains carried in and out. The church was filled. The









             <B>NEW CHURCH COMPLETED          195</B>



large congregation must have reached five or six hundred. The

church is in all respects satisfactory. Colors perhaps too garish

especially in the stained-glass windows.  The aisles--the main

--are inconveniently narrow for taking in and out the coffin.

  February 28.  Saturday.--I will hand to the clergyman who

undertakes to raise the amount due the following: "In order to

provide for the whole debt of the church, General and Mrs.

Hayes will subscribe one-fourth of the amount due, provided

enough is raised from others to pay off the indebtedness. In

case a less sum is raised, they will subscribe one-fourth of the

total sum raised."  Estimated amount of this subscription two

thousand one hundred dollars.

  March 2. Monday. -- Our church meetings yesterday and last

evening were very successful. Rev. Dr. J. W. Hamilton of the

People's Church, Boston, preached twice, and presented the sub-

scription question to the congregation. He stated the debt at

eight thousand three hundred dollars and that he proposed to

raise eight thousand five hundred dollars. In the morning he

raised over seven thousand six hundred, and in the evening enough

more to make the total over nine thousand four hundred dollars!!

He was good-natured, graceful, patient, and sufficiently spirited

and humorous to keep the audience interested and amused, and

at the same time was free from buffoonery and objectionable

levity. Dr. Mather took a prominent part in it [the day's

services] and is receiving invitations and attentions of the friend-

liest sort.





                                   FREMONT, March 3, 1885.

  MY DEAR GUY:--The pecans, after three months, reached

here today in excellent condition. Lucy pronounced them the

finest she ever saw. Certainly they are fine. I shall plant some

of them.

  We have had an unusually severe winter, and some business

failures that involve me somewhat. I am liable on the paper of

a harvester manufacturing company to the extent of thirty

thousand dollars. My total liability will be about thirty-five thou-









<B>196          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



sand. Of this I must pay about twelve to fifteen thousand. This

with my other debts will make the load too heavy for comfort.

But with economy and careful management I hope to pull through

without large sacrifices of property. Uncle subscribed for the

stock as a public-spirited citizen for the benefit of the community.

To carry out his views I become involved in it. It is now im-

portant to me, personally, to have an early return of good times.

  I like the indications from the President elect. His letter on

the silver question is wise and bold. Indeed, I see nothing from

Cleveland that is not full of promise for good.

  I expect to go to Atlanta during the month on the Slater edu-

cation business. It will be done, if the Senate adjourns in time.

I will [shall] be the guest of Governor Colquitt.

  Lucy and all are in usual health.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.



  March 4.  Wednesday.--Inauguration day. I am pleased with

Cleveland, much better than a majority of his party seem to be.

His letter on the eighty-five-cent silver dollar is sensible and

well put. It is against the grounds taken by a majority of his

party.  It is a sound and bold act.  He appears to be faithful

to his committals on the subject of a reform of the civil service.

I am hopeful that he will prove a good Chief Magistrate.





                                    SPIEGEL, March 5, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--The death of Grim<B>*</B> has made us all mourn.

He was a great ornament to our home, and a comfort to all of

us. He was killed instantly by a train on the Lake Shore Rail-

road at Pease's crossing. He stood on the track evidently ex-

pecting the train to turn out for him. All teams turned out for

him; the whole county knew him and respected him. He was

a privileged character in every place. His head was taken clear

off--also his fore-leg. His remains will be buried when the

frost is out of the ground on cemetery point, by the side of "Old

Whitey" and "Old Ned." Some natural tears have been shed

over him, and you will be sad as your mother was and is.

    Cleveland.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, March 6, 1885.

  MY DEAR COLONEL:--It would, I am sure, be a satisfaction

to your father if he could know how deep and universal the re-

joicing is among the people of all parties and descriptions that

Congress has at last yielded to the demand of the country, and

restored him to the army. I was at a meeting of the Grand

Army the evening that the news reached here. The manifesta-

tions of warm feeling were marked. All the comrades are with

him and for him in all that touches his comfort and happiness.

  Mrs. Hayes joins me in special and hearty expressions of sym-

pathy with both your father and mother.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

    New York.

                          FREMONT, OHIO, March 11, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am really surprised that you succeeded in

getting justice in the Louisiana  matter.  I was confident the

money paid would be reimbursed sometime, but I did not expect

it so soon.

  We are all in usual health.--With best wishes,

                          Sincerely,

  March 12. Thursday. -- My cousin, Sarah Moody Kilbourn,

died of paralysis this morning at 10 o'clock at Delaware. She









<B>198          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



would have been seventy-three in a few days. We go to the

funeral tomorrow.  She lay speechless two weeks after the fatal

stroke. She probably was not conscious of her suffering, but

she moaned as if in pain a good deal of the time when she was

awake.

  March 17. Tuesday. -- Returned from Delaware last evening.

Sarah Moody Kilbourn was buried Saturday. We visited at

Carrie Little's; dined with Jones.

  March 20. Friday.--Today received a draft from the Treasury

Department for the amount expended by the commission sent to

Louisiana in 1877 to investigate the situation before withdrawing

the troops. When the bill was before the Senate first the ma-

jority would have passed it, but Conkling insisted on debate--

which would have lost important measures if persisted in. Now

Conkling is gone! Better still, Evarts is in his seat!

  First bluebirds in grove today.





                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 21, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I have nothing yet from General Hawley about

coming to our dedication of the Soldiers' Monument next August.

Please give me your suggestion. We want to get him. Will it

do for me to write him again?  By the way, what do I owe you?

I am now in condition to pay up with thanks.

  The weather is wintry. Three days in succession below zero

since the middle of March.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  SENATOR JOHN SHERMAN.





  March 23. Monday. -- Heard of the President's appointments

to England, France, etc., etc. I like Phelps, Pendleton, etc., etc.

  The President is doing extremely well, and deserves the sup-

port so far of the people of all parties. I no doubt like him

better than the majority of those who elected him. He is sound

on the currency, the tariff, and the reform of the civil service.









             <B>GREAT HOPES OF CLEVELAND          199</B>



  March 26. Thursday.-The First National Bank of New York

sends a claim to Sherman for eight hundred dollars interest on

amount of Louisiana expenses 1877. The appropriation is for

the amount paid by me without interest. Sherman says I am not

bound to pay it. I reply.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 26, 1885.

  MY DEAR SENATOR:--I am surprised at the letter of the bank.

Of course I had no personal knowledge as to the arrangement.

But I am clear as to the original understanding I had that they

would wait for the Government appropriation and look to it

alone. I was sure they were wrong to ask for it four years

ago. And now to ask interest seems preposterous.

  But you know all the facts, and if you think I ought to lose it,

I will cheerfully acquiesce. Do precisely as you think ought to

be done.                  Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 27, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Enclosed I send you the amount named in

your letter. I am perfectly willing to add to it the interest. It

is gratifying to know that the bank takes the same view of the

case that we do.

  I will write General Hawley again as soon as the Senate ad-

journs. -- I return you Baker's dispatch.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                           FREMONT, OHIO, March 31, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--The closing up of the Louisiana matter is

very gratifying. The money is the smallest part of it. It is an

all-sufficient reply to the foolish "fraud" cry of the Sun and a

few other implacables in both parties.

  There is a degree of uncertainty about the next election. The

chances for Republican success seem to be good. Assuming









<B>200          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



that you have no special aversion to running the risk of defeat

at the election, your true course is plain enough. Everybody

whose opinion you ought to care about wants you to continue

to be our Senator.  They are really in earnest and solicitous

about it. You will, I think, have no competitor in the party.

In any event, your support by the Republicans is beyond question.

In my view you ought to remain in the Senate. I hope you

will see the situation as I do.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



  April 1.  Wednesday.--I think of forty-three years ago. The

birthday of Laura! All the family of that day gone except

myself, and the then just arrived infant. Mother, Fanny, Uncle

Bichard, Platt, Harriet Solace, Mrs. Warren, and Mrs. Kil-

bourn!

  April 2. -- Went with Lucy to church. -- From there I went

to the high-school building and heard Professor Finley, of Akron,

read a fair paper on Thoreau. Thoreau was a man of gifts and

culture. Simple, sincere, and brave. But he failed in his duties.

He was not a good citizen, not a patriot; "never married, never

went to church, never voted, and never paid a tax," said Pro-

fessor Finley.  To this I added, "and it is a satisfaction that he

did go to jail"! as he ought. This will do as a joke.

  This morning prepared remarks to be read this afternoon be-

fore a home mission society.

  In the evening attended the revival meeting of the Methodist

Episcopal church. These meetings have been held almost every

night for six or eight weeks. The accessions to the church are

over one hundred new converts, and perhaps forty or fifty others

who have been at some time members but who have discontinued

membership or attendance. The meetings will soon be discon-

tinued. This, to enable our pastor, Mr. Prentiss, to recover his

strength and to enable him to give attention to the general in-

terests of the church. The new members must be allowed to

settle down to plain duties as Christians. The excitement of









             <B>METHODIST REVIVAL SERVICES          201</B>



their new situation must wear off and everyday life be resumed.

This seems to be the view of Mr. Prentiss.

  The manner of the revival meetings is usually about this:

Precisely at the appointed hour, the bell having ceased to ring,

and the congregation being all seated and quiet, Mr. Prentiss

takes his stand in front of the desk, near the altar rail, and an-

nounces from a small revival hymn-book the hymn. Miss Ickes

at the small organ starts the tune. Mr. Prentiss who is a good

singer begins, with his left hand beating time and walking along

the platform, occupying in his walk ten or twelve feet in length

along near the altar-rail. He sings with an earnest, strong, and

good voice. The whole congregation rise and join in spirit.

There is generally a chorus that is repeated with increasing unc-

tion. "Bringing in the Sheaves" is a favorite hymn. Having

finished the first hymn, a second, a third, and [a] fourth im-

mediately follow. The whole house soon enters into the spirit

of it.

  At the end of the fourth hymn Mr. Prentiss says, "Let us all

now kneel and invoke the Divine assistance."  He kneels at the

altar-rail and in a short prayer, with much feeling, appeals for

the coming of the Spirit to each heart.  He next reads from the

Scriptures--possibly with comments.  Another hymn follows;

then a short sermon, urging the necessity of prompt surrender

or acceptance of the means of salvation. After the sermon he

asks all to come forward, "the old and young in years, the old

and young in Christ"; "and while we sing [he adds] let all who

desire Christ or the prayers of the church or who feel an interest

in their soul's salvation come forward and kneel at the altar."

  He then, as the members move towards the altar-rail, the whole

congregation standing and singing, goes along the aisles and

urges those whom  [who] he knows are thinking of joining the

church or those whom [who] he sees are deeply interested, to

come forward. One and another comes forward and kneels.

The example is contagious, and some evenings ten or fifteen

new "converts" are seen "seeking their Saviour."

  Members are called on for short prayers. Singing and praying

continue twenty or thirty minutes. There is not much shouting,

not many spontaneous "amens," but there is an occasional "Thank









<B>202          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



God" or sigh or groan. Mr. Prentiss himself is apt to interject

frequently "Amen," "Thank God," "Yes," without regard to

the sense of the prayer, thus giving vent to his feelings as the

praying goes on. All the new converts are, while kneeling, en-

couraged by the older members who kneel by their sides, and

affectionately urge them to go on and adopt "the new life."

Ladies often pray in low sweet tones. There is nothing un-

seemly or boisterous. There is warm and deep emotion, with-

out demonstration. A subdued excitement pervades the assem-

bly. The converts are about equally male and female, young

and old. For the most part they are of the middle and poorer

classes.

  When all have been talked with and recognized who come for-

ward as converts, Mr. Prentiss says, "You will all now return

to your places." A hymn, [a] prayer, the doxology, and a bene-

diction close the meeting.

  April 3. Friday. -- Fanny came last night. Her mother and I

were in the library waiting for her.  She is full of spirit--is

healthy and animated. Fine-looking and intellectual. With

sweet and very engaging manners.

  April 4. Saturday. -- Clear and quiet -- one or two inches of

snow gives the grove a wintry appearance. About 1 P. M. I

went over to Toledo. . . . Met Mr. William Corlett at the

door, commander of Forsythe Post, G. A. R. This is the second

largest post in the State. They invited me some weeks ago to

spend an evening with them. I accepted with the understanding

that I was not to be expected to make an elaborate address,

merely an over hand [offhand], desultory talk. The time was

fixed for next Wednesday evening, April 8.

  During the last few days the death of General Grant has been

regarded as likely to occur soon. Soldiers especially are thinking

of him and his sufferings constantly. If he dies I shall want to

attend his funeral. I therefore saw Commander Corlett to let

him know that I must be excused from the engagement for

Wednesday evening, in case General Grant dies before that time.

All this was arranged accordingly. . . .

  Evening read Professor Fiske's "Cosmic Philosophy."









             <B>METHODIST REVIVAL SERVICES          203</B>



                             FREMONT, OHIO, April 4, 1885.

  MY DEAR SENATOR: -- I see it stated that General Grant wishes,

in case of death, to be buried at Washington.

  It seems to me proper to attend the funeral wherever it is, and

if at Washington, I will come there. You will probably break

up in Washington before the funeral.  Let me know as to the

hotel I should go to. I used to prefer the Ebbitt or the Riggs,

but I am not at all informed about them.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    Washington.



  April 5. Sunday. -- We had a full church today--Easter day

-- a good sermon, taking the orthodox view of the resurrection.

  My darling daughter Fanny and our good niece (cousin, in

fact), Adda S. Cook, when the call was made by Mr. Prentiss

for new members, went forward after several others had done

so, and stood at the altar while the congregation were singing

the closing hymn. I had no intimation of her purpose to do this.

Possibly, I would have preferred that she should wait until she

was more mature. She is now seventeen (was seventeen Sep-

tember 2) and is of good judgment, lovely disposition, and solid

character. I hope she will be true to her convictions of duty

and [I] have every reason to hope she will be so. With this

result, the step will not be a mistake. Dear girl! How I love

her. She resembles my mother rather more than my sister

Fanny or her own mother.  But she has many of the best traits

of my wife and sister. She is a rare sunbeam in the house.

  April 6.  Monday.--Scott returns to his school at Green

Springs for one term longer tonight. Three months from now I

must decide for him again -- what to study next--where to go?

My inclination is to stop Greek, take German instead, and an

industrial training school, -- drawing, penmanship, and mechani-

cal instruction.

  April 9. Thursday.--Last evening attended a crowded meeting

of Forsythe Post, G. A. R. and spoke an hour, quite acceptably,









<B>204          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



with much enjoyment to myself. Old soldiers are always an

inspiring audience. General Comly looks pale and delicate. With

Walbridge rode over the town of Toledo. It is growing; many

fine dwellings of recent style are going up.

  April 10. Friday.--Forenoon engaged on my correspondence,

which still continues large. General Grant is easier; may live

some days. I would like to attend the Detroit organization of

the Loyal Legion for Michigan, but may not be able to do so.

It will be the 13th, Monday.

  April 11. Saturday.--Attended the I. O. O. F. meeting last

evening, Croghan Lodge, Number 77. The new "work" adds to

the interest of the meetings and attracts a large attendance. In

spite of rain and mud some sixty or seventy were present. Men

naturally love dramatic representations, are fond of taking part

in them. The interest of these societies is largely dependent on

this tendency.



                            FREMONT, OHIO, April 11, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- Your letter, inviting me to attend the memo-

rial services on the twentieth anniversary of the death of Abra-

ham Lincoln, at Springfield, Illinois, is before me.

  Abraham Lincoln was the martyr of a stainless cause. It

was the cause of America--"the cradle of the future." It was

more. It was indeed the cause of all mankind. The triumph of

this cause, so good and so great, was due, under Providence,

more largely to Lincoln than to any other man. He was the

embodiment of its spirit, its principles, and its purposes. He

was the truest representative and the highest type of the plain

people whose courage, patience, and faith, in the army and at

home, won the victory.

  With each passing year, the unmeasured greatness and the

priceless value of the work of which he was the leader becomes

more clear. The twentieth anniversary of the appalling event

which closed that momentous struggle, the great American Con-

flict, finds the world able to see Lincoln and his deeds with a

larger and wiser appreciation than ever before. Every anni-









             <B>LINCOLN'S GREATNESS          205</B>



versary, to the end of time, of the event you now commemorate,

will surely bring to Lincoln, to his character and to the results of

his life, the increased esteem, admiration, and gratitude of all

civilized men.

   Regretting that I cannot take part with you in the celebration,

I remain,

                           Sincerely,

   [Unidentified.]                              R. B. HAYES.



  April 12, 1885. -- Twenty-seven young persons were baptized

this forenoon in the First Methodist Episcopal church of Fre-

mont. Mr. Prentiss was so liberal as to the "sacrament" that

one doubts its importance. Three modes spoken of, immersion,

sprinkling, and pouring.

  Read Cross' first volume of George Eliot. He allows her to

tell her own story by a judicious selection and arrangement of

extracts from her correspondence.

  April 13.--General Grant had a bad day and night again

after a considerable improvement Saturday.

  April 14. Tuesday. -- I start this morning, 9:30, for Chicago

to attend as a member of the fifth congress of the Loyal Legion.

  Chicago, April 15.  Wednesday. -- Colonel Bell, of Toledo, got

in the train at Toledo. A pleasant trip; in the afternoon a snow-

storm; was met about 8 P. M. at Lake Shore depot by Colonel

Corbin, and taken to the Leland House. After dressing attended

the opera "Aida"--Patti.  In the box of the president of the

Musical Society, Mr. Peck, with Mme. Nevada, Dr. Palmer, and

others.  Met also Dr. Nixon, my old secretary Busby, and many

other acquaintances. The great enjoyment was the audience,

said to be the largest ever in the world at an opera, -- six thou-

sand five hundred seated and--

  April 16.  Thursday. -- The Congress of the Loyal Legion met

in the parlor of the Pacific Hotel.  I was chosen president,

Major Nicholson, secretary. It was opened with prayer by the

editor of the Northwestern Christian Advocate.  The minutes

were quite voluminous, and on motion were read only by ex-









<B>206          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tracts. A committee on constitutional amendments, in the lan-

guage of the resolution to the same effect at the fourth con-

gress, the last before this, was raised, one from each com-

mandery. I called on the commanderies to name their committee-

men. A world of amendments were proposed and sent to the

committee without being read in the hearing of the congress.

The general sentiment is extremely conservative. No radical or

important amendment is likely to pass the committee or the

congress. I favor a number of amendments.

  1. To strike out the primogeniture feature and adopt the

American principle -- descent to all the sons. This makes them

"eligible" alike.

  2. Make non-commissioned officers and privates eligible

(either generally or to a number not exceeding in any com-

mandery the number of the commissioned officers).

  3. Make eligible to second-class membership the sons of offi-

cers who were eligible, but who died before becoming members.

  4.  I wish to secure authority to make members-at-large--

Bickham and Devereux.

  I do not expect the first two to be received with favor. The

last two I hope will be adopted.

  Our banquet last night was an exceedingly fine affair. The

singing was enthusiastic and stirring. Almost all "tramped"

around the room among the tables emphasizing the song, "Tramp,

tramp, tramp, the boys are marching." This after the regular

programme was gone through with. The speeches were short

and well put. The best were by Lambert, of Philadelphia, Duf-

field, of Detroit, and Kemper, of Cincinnati. I responded briefly

in a well-received speech of three or four minutes. It was

a mistake that I did not speak longer. I alluded to the contribu-

tion of Illinois to the good cause, and a strong sentence or two

named Lincoln and Grant. I had it in mind to touch briefly on

their character and careers. It was a mistake not to do it. But

I am so averse to long speeches, that I struck for the merit of

brevity, as I usually do. They gave me a rousing cheer, long

continued, as I rose; were responsive all through, and at the

close gave three rattling cheers.

  The distinctive features were: 1. Only a few short speeches.









             <B>LOYAL LEGION CONGRESS          207</B>



2. The old army calls by bugle and drum. 3. The band played

familiar army tunes in a way to start spontaneous singing of the

best soldier songs. 4. The marching, "Tramp, tramp."

  Today we finished by one o'clock P. M., the business of the

congress and adjourned sine die.  At the closing, after the

resolutions of thanks, as presiding officer, I made a short off-

hand speech, which easily warmed up into a talk, which the

congress directed to be printed and sent to all the com-

manderies. I must see to the revision. It was taken down by a

shorthand reporter. Three things besides the amendment and

improvement of the constitution were done which interested me;

  1. The sons of men, entitled to be members who died without

becoming such, are eligible.

  2. The election at large of Bickham and Devereux.

  3.  The Commandery-in-Chief to be organized this year on

the call of General Hancock at Philadelphia.





          LELAND HOTEL, CHICAGO, April 16, Thursday, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--I arrived on time in a heavy snow-storm,

after an agreeable trip, and was met at the station by Colonel

Corbin, and in less than half an hour was on my way to the

opera. The attraction was Patti, and the great hall, and espe-

cially "the largest audience that ever attended an opera in the

world." I borrow the Chicago boast. Surely, it was the largest

and most brilliant spectacle of the sort I ever saw. I was put

in the box with Mme. Nevada, the popular favorite of the day

here. She was natural, agreeable, and chatty. I also talked in

another box with Mrs. MacVeagh and ever so many other

friends of yours.    Senator Manderson showered on you the

Washington compliments he was "constantly" hearing from

everybody in Washington.

  Our Loyal Legion has had its first business meetings, and the

banquet given to the congress by the Chicago companions.

Nothing could have been better than the latter. My personal

reception as the president of the congress was and is exceedingly

partial.









<B>208          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  I have visited the Gettysburg panorama twice. It is the great

spectacle of the city. I agree with the boast, "the finest battle

picture in the world."

  I have called nowhere yet. Mrs. Jewett will be the first person

to be seen, and after that others if I have time. Tonight the

reception to the Loyal Legion at Mr. George W. Smith's claims

attention.

  Our business is likely to be concluded tomorrow -- possibly

today. I expect to start for home Saturday -- reaching there

at the evening 7 o'clock arrival on the Lake Shore.

  I am very glad I came. All the circumstances are agreeable.

  You have no idea how much you are counted on in all these

affairs. I have seen several gentlemen who entertained you or

were at entertainments for you when you last visited Chicago.

  With love to Adda, remembrances to the girls, Lizzy and

Hattie, and "s'much" for yourself,

                       Affectionately,

                                              RUTHERFORD.

  MRS. HAYES.



  April 24. Friday.--At night attended anniversary of I. O. O.

F. and Daughters of Rebecca. Talked acceptably on Burns and

education. Told how Schuyler Colfax passed as Speaker in

five minutes a bill reviving the postal service in the South. A

bill that would have consumed hours in the reading was passed

by Mr. Colfax without untying the roll. An endorsement by

the House of its confidence in the integrity, ability, and industry

of the Speaker. It was known that he had thoroughly examined

the bill and knew that it was not only right in principle and de-

tail but also that no member would wish to object to it if he

understood it.

  April 29. Wednesday.--Rev. Mr. Bingley came up to the

house without overcoat or baggage; introduced himself as one

of Father Taylor's missionaries recently from Panama. A

singular, simple being from Massachusetts, born near Boston.

Staid all day and in the evening went to the prayer-meeting;

made a short talk.









             <B>LOYAL LEGION CONGRESS          209</B>



  May 3. Sunday.--Heard Mr. Gascoigne, of Oak Harbor,

preach in the morning. A sermon like a song should have one

leading idea and only one. The crowding a sermon with dif-

ferent topics of equal importance, not specially related to each

other, confuses and weakens the impression. Attacks on special

amusements or social customs are out of place in the pulpit.

Whatever is objectionable will be included in the sinfulness in

what is unchristian in life and conduct.

  May 5.  Tuesday. -- Read Scott's "Napoleon" -- the campaign

to Moscow. Examined the report of Dr. Haygood carefully. He

has been misled in some of his statistics by the omission of note

or mem. showing that in the Pacific division of States Chinese,

etc., are included in the "colored." I must write to him.

  May 11. Monday. -- With Colonel Haynes received the report

of the directors of the Fremont Harvester Company. Agreed

to report to the committee of the stockholders, that each man

must arrange for the settlement of his liability.

  May 14. Thursday.--In the evening met with the committee of

the stockholders of the Harvester Company and as special com-

mittee (Haynes and myself) reported the situation to the gen-

eral committee. After a full and intelligent discussion, it was

resolved on my motion to request a meeting with the directors

of the company with a view to the adoption of a plan for the

settlement of the liability of the stockholders. The only sugges-

tion was Mr. Amsden's, viz., that the liability be paid in six,

twelve, and eighteen months.

  May  17.  Sunday.--I go to New York tomorrow to attend

the meeting of the Slater Board.  We have invited Governor

Thompson, of South Carolina, Mr. Orr, of Georgia, Dr. Curry,

and General Armstrong to meet with us. How best to do the

work in hand, is the question.

  After my return my first duty is to speak at Ripley at the

unveiling of a soldiers' monument on Memorial Day.  I must

dwell on the fruits of the war--what we have gained, what

the world has gained, by the war.

   14









<B>210          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  No monuments are built for the mere warrior. Napoleon is

not admired or loved--the greatest soldier in history; but the

private in the great war which gained the United States of

America, whose fruit is the American Republic, will be gratefully

remembered and admired forever.

  I will venture also to repeat again some part of the argument

in favor of aid by the Nation to education in the South; to com-

plete and secure the victory gained by the Union arms. The

measure is in no sense partisan; it is in no sense sectional. Both

of the National Conventions declared in substance in favor of

it last year.

  In Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet three were members of the Senate

when the vote was taken. (See Congressional Record of April 8,

1884). Garland and Lamar were for the bill; one, Bayard, was

against it on legal or constitutional grounds. A majority of the

Northern Senators were for the bill; a majority of the Southern

Senators were for it. A majority of the Democrats were for it;

a majority of the Republicans were for it.

  May 18. Monday. -- More monuments have already been

built in honor of the heroes of our War for the Union than

have been erected in memory of any other war recorded in his-

tory; and before a century passes more monuments having their

origin in our war will have been erected than for all the other

wars of all the world in all time.

  Took the 11:25 A. M. train East. Soon met ex-Governor

Cullom, now Senator from Illinois, destined for New York to

attend a meeting on interstate commerce. Met afterwards Cap-

tain DeBus, Loyal Legion, of Cincinnati; also Colonel Pond, of

Rochester. An interesting trip. Much entertained with war

stories by Colonel Pond and DeBus, and a general posting up

in political life at Washington, and the struggle for Senator in

Illinois. Cullom fears bribery of Republican members from

Chicago will lose Logan the seat.

  May 19. Tuesday.--Reached Fifth Avenue Hotel at 10:30

A. M. Met and lunched with Senator Pratt and Senator Harris

of the Senate committee. Mr. Dawson (N. E.), stenographer,









             <B>SLATER BOARD MEETING          211</B>



called; formerly with McCrary, Secretary of War, now with the

committee [and] asked for by General Grant. Very civil.

  May 20. Wednesday. -- The Slater Board met at nine A. M.

Chief Justice Waite, President Gilman, William E. Dodge, Mr.

Stuart, Morris K. Jesup, Dr. Haygood, and myself. With us

as guests and advisors, Gustavus L. Orr, school commissioner of

Georgia, and Dr. J. L. M. Curry, of the Peabody Board.

  Dr. Haygood opened with prayer. I read letters from the

absent -- Slater, Brooks, and Boyce. No word from Senator

Colquitt.  The minutes of the January meeting read.  Dr. Hay-

good read extracts from his printed report. All excellent. Also

his report on education in Georgia. After this, letters from Gen-

eral Armstrong and President Ware, of Atlanta, were read. Mr.

Jesup read the financial report. Our investments are all above

par but one first mortgage of Nickel Plate--one hundred thou-

sand dollars--which is 76.  Our securties are now worth one

million eighty thousand dollars--eighty thousand dollars more

than the original amount.

  About 1 P. M., the Chief Justice and I called on General

Grant.  He was alone and we were admitted at once.  He was

dressed as usual, except he wore slippers and an invalid's black

silk cap.  His hands were thinner than formerly but his face

was full and fresh. His voice was a little thick and utterance

difficult. He was cheerful, bright, and smiled often pleasantly.

He said he was able to do more work than if he was well. If

well, he would read and investigate for himself, giving much

time to it. Now his sons did the reading, and he dictated to a

stenographer.  He said he had just changed stenographers.  Now

he has Mr. Dawson, formerly with Secretary  McCrary.            He

can now do four times as much as he usually did when well.

All the ladies out riding.  He sent his regards to Mrs. Hayes;

inquired about her.  Same as to Mrs. Waite.  When we left

he said he was glad we had called before the doctors came,

that he was expecting them soon, and "they will tear me all to

pieces," he said. He walked a little lame, not so lame, he said,

as he had been, "but I will always be lame," he said. He was

in his room in the second story, Number 3, Sixty-sixth Street









<B>212          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



east of Central Park. He accompanied us to the stairs. He

shook hands. Nothing was said, but I left him with a feeling

that this was our last meeting! I am sure he is happy notwith-

standing he sees the end so near. He has lived to see how

strong a hold he has on the hearts of his countrymen.





                             SPIEGEL GROVE, May 23, 1885.

  DEAR AUNTY DAVIS:--Your letter to Lucy about the project

for reviving Wesleyan College by an endowment of fifty thou-

sand dollars came during the absence of both Rutherford and

myself.  It did not reach Lucy until Tuesday--after the time

when you wanted the dispatch. Hence, in the absence of the

clerk, no reply has been made.

  Lucy feels a warm interest in the dear old college and is in

full sympathy with those who wish to aid it. I will be in Cin-

cinnati next week, and on talking it over, will decide as to

her subscription. Very likely she will do what you have done.

She certainly would, but for the heavy failure of our chief man-

ufacturing company--"the Harvester Works"--which  is a

temporary embarrassment in my affairs, throwing upon [me]

the unlooked for payment of ten to fifteen thousand dollars im-

mediately.

               With all good wishes, sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MRS. ELIZA G. DAVIS,

    Cincinnati.





  May 25. Monday.--Yesterday Rev. Dr. Bushnell preached

an excellent discourse to the G. A. R. post at the Presbyterian

church. Our post is divided. A saloon-keeper, Captain "Tony"

Young, was last winter elected commander. The drinking ele-

ment came fully into power in the post. The "better element"

seceded. An ugly contest is going on. The seceders want an-

other post. They are opposed by those they left. I still stay

with General Buckland and a few other law-and-order people in

the old post. The seceders are mostly Republicans; many of









             <B>THE OMAHA SALOON EPISODE          213</B>



them are temperance people. It is a sad business in our little

circle. I do not see how we are to heal the trouble.

  May 26.  Tuesday -- I am abused as the owner of property

used for a saloon in Omaha,--of which I know nothing.  My

reply to the editor who writes to me is as follows:--



Private.

                                     FREMONT, May 26, 1885.

  DEAR SIR: -- Your note of yesterday in relation to the report

that I am renting property in Omaha for saloon purposes is

before me.

  I own real estate in Omaha in partnership with General R. P.

Buckland, of this town.  General Buckland has had the whole

charge of the lots as [to] leasing, selling, paying taxes, etc.,

etc.   He    is  a  consistent  temperance     man    and    would

not  knowingly  rent  property  for  selling  liquor.     He  has

done the business through an agent, Mr. Byron Reed, of Omaha.

I have supposed he was a good citizen and an upright man, and

have never for a moment suspected that the property would be

used as here reported until this affair was brought to my notice.

I have directed, or rather requested, General Buckland to look

into it and to put an end to the cause of complaint as soon as

possible. You will no doubt believe me when I say that I would

not knowingly rent property for a saloon. General Buckland

did not suspect it until I called his attention to it.

  As to the use of my name or authority: I do not deny or ex-

plain untruths about me. The reason is obvious. If I did, the

failure to deny in any case would be an admission in that case of

its truth, and I would be kept busy making denials. I give you

the facts and refer you to General Buckland, of this town. You

will therefore deal with the matter without quoting me as au-

thority and thereby oblige,

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  W. H. H. BARTRAUS,

    EDITOR XVI Amendment,

      Buffalo.









<B>214          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Private.

                                   FREMONT, May 27, 1885.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I received yesterday a paper with a

paragraph as to the liquor selling on my property in Omaha. I

wish you to know the facts--not for publication but for your

own eye. I was greatly surprised when the matter was men-

tioned. I would not knowingly allow my property to be so used,

and [I] knew that my partner, General Buckland, had this feel-

ing. He has had the sole charge of leasing, selling, paying taxes,

and attending to our lots. Under ordinary circumstances there

would be no difficulty. But he is now in very feeble health, is

perhaps seventy-three or seventy-four years old, and is in great

distress about his wife's mental condition. I want to make him

as little trouble as practicable in this business. I want you to

give me the facts and also the remedy.

  General Buckland is an excellent man and on his discretion

and judgment I would ordinarily rely.

                          Sincerely,

  GENERAL CHARLES F. MANDERSON,                  R. B. HAYES.





  May 28. Thursday. -- Touching the Omaha affair, the Chi-

cago News gives the interview with Manderson with substantial

correctness. It is obvious that the case was one of entire igno-

rance on my part as to what my partner and agent had done. If

the laws of Nebraska are what they should be the lease can be

declared void.



                323 ELM STREET, CINCINNATI, May 31, 1885.

  MY DARLING: -- Just from church where we heard a good talk

on the heart in the usual sense--not in the forced sense of our

Lima friend.

  I was on both sides of the question of your presence yester-

day at [the unveiling of the Soldiers' Monument at] Ripley. Old

soldiers of all of our regiments were so cordial [and] many

things [were] so beautiful and gratifying, that I was sorry you









             <B>RIPLEY SOLDIERS' MONUMENT          215</B>



and Fanny could not enjoy it with me. But just at the crisis the

showers came furiously and broke up the meeting. We after-

wards spoke in the Methodist church in town. I was in excel-

lent trim -- got along well -- shook hands with a great multitude

of old comrades and others. On returning this (Sunday) morn-

ing, I came to Aunty Davis', and shall be here until Tuesday or

Wednesday, when I will go to the Burnet House and thence to

Cleveland, and home about Friday.

  General Cox can't deliver our address at the unveiling. Let

Rud see Haynes and Buckland and ask if I shall [ask] General

Leggett and write me at the Burnet House.

  Harriet [Herron] is well, but bored dreadfully with her visi-

tors of the Presbyterian Church Assembly.

  Sunday afternoon I rode with Dr. Davis to Mount Auburn,

Walnut Hills, and Eden Park, visiting patients. We passed the

corner where Fanny was born eighteen years ago (!) next Sep-

tember. Blocks are built in front of it, and it is now in a city

neighborhood, but the old house, nearly hidden by new buildings,

still stands.

  The doctor looks well, but age begins to tell, and he begins

to feel that the time has come for him to retire from his pro-

fessional practice. I hope he will decide to do so. He is in a

good financial condition and the presidency of his insurance

company is open to him. . . .

                         Affectionately,

                                                           R.

  MRS. HAYES.





  Cincinnati, June 2.  At Dr. John Davis'.--I reached Ripley

[by boat] about 9 or 10 A. M., Memorial Day, Saturday, May

30. General C. H. Grosvenor, wife, and child were on the boat.

General Grosvenor and I were the speakers at the unveiling of

the Soldiers' Monument in the cemetery.  We were escorted by

G. A. R. veterans and a military company and band from the

landing to the house of Mr. Galbreath, a banker of Ripley.  The

marshal was Captain Boyd, formerly of my command, Thirty-

fourth Ohio. I met many gentlemen of the vicinity: Rev. Dr.









<B>216          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Stevenson, President of the Methodist Episcopal institution at

Augusta, Kentucky, two ex-members (Democrats) of the Legis-

lature from Brown County, who knew me when I was governor,

and a large number of soldiers of the old Kanawha Division--

Twelfth, Thirty-fourth, Ninety-first, etc., -- all so cordial and

brotherly.

  One of the ex-representatives told this "to illustrate the

shrewdness of women in public life." He said, "I told my wife

when I got home that I had been to a reception by Mrs.

Governor ---.  She is an intelligent and accomplished lady but

not at all handsome. She selected to receive with her three or

four very plain-looking women. She was really fine-looking by

comparison with those who received with her. When Mrs.

Hayes had her receptions, she always had the ladies of the best

appearance she could find to receive with her; but she is so hand-

some that she always outshone the others."

  Just as speaking was to begin at the unveiling of the monu-

ment a thunder-storm burst upon us violently. We retreated to

the town. Soon after in a church (Methodist Episcopal) we

shot off our speeches. I was a little cramped for time but on

the whole got on satisfactorily. In the evening we returned on

the St. Lawrence to Cincinnati after a good time in spite of

the rain. We breakfasted on the boat and I came to Dr. Davis'.

Here are Mrs. Nordhoff, Miss Marie Thompson, of Washington,

and this good family. Never were better people, or more hos-

pitable hosts than Dr. and Mrs. Davis. . . .

  I have visited John W. and Mrs. Herron, my oldest friends,

and dearest. Will go to the Burnet House sometime today. The

installation as commander of the Loyal Legion will take place

tomorrow evening. [I shall say in substance: --]

  "This is my third election to the place. All know how much I

value the services we rendered together during those long,

anxious, critical but golden years from 1861 to 1865. Tested

by its results it is the greatest war of all history. America was

indeed the cradle of the future. In great peril, our Republic

and our America might have been destroyed and would have been

destroyed but for the work we did.  After that work, it no

longer was a cradle -- it was no longer a possibility; it became









             <B>LOYAL LEGION QUALITY          217</B>



a probability; with wisdom and moderation it became a cer-

tainty, and that certainty was and is that America is the im-

pregnable fortress of whatever is best in the world, in govern-



ment, in society, and in civilization.

  "Our society, the most permanent of all soldier organizations,

stands on this matchless service as its origin, its foundation, and

its reason for being. It also perpetuates all that is dearest and

most tender and most precious in our past lives and transmits

what it is possible to transmit to our children of that which

is best in our lives and deeds. I value above all price your kind-

ness in permitting me to be so honorably associated with you."

  June 6. Saturday.--I returned from Cincinnati Thursday

with Jack Herron. Rev. E. C. Gavitt preached in our church

this afternoon. He is a pioneer of Methodism in this region.

He preached here in 1828! I bought his book "Crumbs from

my Saddlebags."

  June 11.  Thursday.--My young friend Edward W.  Bok

is worried about the Omaha slander. It still is true that the best

acts of a man's life bring him the most abuse. The exclusion of

wine from the White House is at the bottom of three-fourths of

all the lies that are now told about me. I must let General Buck-

land write young Bok in substance:--

  1. That I had nothing to do with the management or leasing

of the Omaha lots.

  2. That we did not know that the ground was used for saloon

purposes, and that we would not have rented it for such pur-

poses.

  3.  That when we heard the charge that our lots were so

used, we got out of it as soon as the law permitted and now own

no lots which are used for saloon purposes.

  4. That the lots were vacant when we bought them, that we

have owned no buildings in Omaha, that we leased ground only.

  June 13.  Saturday.--Rode with Rev. Dr. E. Bushnell  in

my buggy to Green Spring to attend a meeting of the trustees of

Green Spring Academy. . . . Academy is in a bad way.

The man is not yet found. The Spring House has found the

man, Dr. Marshall, and is doing well.









<B>218          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



   June 20. Saturday.--Returned last evening with Fanny

and Mrs. Dr. John A. Little from Delaware. We went down

Monday morning. I got to the meeting of the trustees of the

Ohio Wesleyan University just in time to be introduced with

the other new members.  A body of thirty--sensible, and with

correct views and purposes. I was with Fanny the guest of

Mrs. Little, the widow of my college chum, John A. Little. A

happy week for both of us. Fanny's first week "in society."

  At commencement I got off a rapid talk on the educational

question of the hour, viz., industrial education. My proposition

was that between the age of fourteen and the age of leaving

school or colleges five to ten hours a week should be given to

manual labor under the instruction of a skilful teacher.





                          SPIEGEL, FREMONT, June 22, 1885.

  MY DEAR FRIEND: -- It is always a glad day when I get your

words. You may be sure that silence is construed as you would

wish. My constant fear about you is too much hard work. I

would not add a feather's weight to the load you so recklessly

pile upon yourself.

  Your Hammond paper is so good that if I did not know

how successfully you deal with affairs of business and politics,

I would say your forte is as a historian and biographer.

  We are all as we were. The failure of our Harvester Com-

pany here and no sale for real estate involves me temporarily

in financial perplexities, but it will all come right, no doubt,

with better times. I still hammer away at my hobbies -- educa-

tion at the South, industrial education, the Peabody and Slater

work, and the like.

  No doubt Providence will simmer down and clarify the chaos

of capital and labor which now looks so alarming. But we

naturally want to help Providence. Without any fanaticism, I

hope, it seems to me that to educate all to work with skill with

eyes and hands is the way out. If not that, it, at least, will

lend much needed help to the right side of many a critical ques-

tion.  So, I pronounce on this and kindred topics.  At Delaware

(the commencement) I gave a boost to the cause. Our old









             <B>MANUAL TRAINING ESSENTIAL          219</B>



friend, General Cowen, complimented me by saying that I had

tread [trod] on more toes and harder than anybody who ever

spoke at Delaware. "But," said he, "you are right. I agree

with you from top to bottom."

  You are rich enough to quit the severer toil. Now do. I

shall be at home all summer. Give us a Sunday and a week be-

fore and after.

  Mrs. Hayes and I unite in best wishes to Mrs. S. and you.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -- I think of Cleveland as you do, and am glad you are

so favorably impressed with him.--H.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.





  June 25.  Thursday. -- Birch came last evening and staid all

night. He says a bright young German Democrat, lately clerk

of the courts in Ottawa County, told him that after visiting the

exposition in New Orleans he travelled through Alabama and

Mississippi and is now satisfied that neither Tilden in 1876 nor

Cleveland in 1884 were elected.  The suppression of the colored

vote no doubt deprives the Republicans of five certain States,

viz., South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louis-

iana, and of two which would probably be with them, viz., North

Carolina and Virginia.

  June 27.  Saturday.--My old friend Judge Matthews dis-

patches me that he will spend Sunday with me. As judge of

the Supreme Court he is holding court at Cleveland.  It will

be a most welcome visit.

  When about to talk on the war I like to read Lincoln's pun-

gent sentences. Only ten sentences in the Gettysburg speech.

Shorter than an ordinary family letter.  But all gold--imper-

ishable gold! Eternal, enduring as truth.

  In his message he says, "We cannot escape history." "We

shall nobly save or meanly lose the last, best hope of

earth."









<B>220          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  June 28.  Sunday.--Judge Matthews looks very well.  He

talks cheerfully. His wife's death last January has left its sor-

rowing impress on him. But he is genial and interesting as of

old and always.

  Touching the World's slander by Crawford, these are the

facts:--The charge is that in 1880, when Garfield went East,

Jay Gould required as a condition of his contributing one hun-

dred thousand dollars or one hundred and fifty thousand dollars

to the campaign fund the written pledge of Garfield that he

would appoint Matthews Supreme Judge in place of Swayne.

This does not necessarily implicate Matthews in the corrupt bar-

gain.   But it is not true.  It is absurd.  It was perfectly well

known that Swayne would resign during the term of Hayes

and that he would appoint Matthews to the vacancy. There

is a belief, however, among newspaper men at Washington that

the story is founded in fact, viz., that Gould got a pledge that

Garfield would appoint some one, presumably Dillon, in place

of Hunt, then a paralytic and likely to be retired by Act of

Congress, and that the written pledge is or was in the hands of

Whitelaw Reid. It could not have been foreseen in August 1880

that Matthews would be nominated by Hayes to fill Swayne's

place and that the nomination would fail to be acted on, and the

appointment be renewed by Garfield in the spring of 1881.

  June 29.  Monday. -- Judge Matthews left this morning after

a very gratifying visit (to us at least) from him of two nights.

He looks well and is capable of his best work. He will dis-

tinguish himself as a member of the Supreme Court. Indeed,

already he has taken high rank. Many who opposed his ap-

pointment now admit their mistake. Even Senator Edmunds

is now satisfied that great injustics was done to Matthews in the

attacks made on him in 1881 in the Senate and by the press.

  July 5.  Sunday. -- I am now beginning the invitations and

correspondence required for our celebration of the unveiling of

the Soldiers' Monument, August 1. It will occupy me largely

for a few weeks.









             <B>APPOINTMENT OF MATTHEWS          221</B>



                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 7, 1885.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--We are all disappointed.  We counted

on having Mrs. Force and Horton with yourself at our home

during some time this summer. We are in good condition. The

Green Springs and the islands are more accessible from here than

ever before. Neat little excursion steamers run from here often.

No one can feel more than we do the rapidly narrowing of the

circle of those near and dear. Our life at Washington led us

to know rather aged people. They are going -- going.

  You make a noble trip [abroad]. I envy you the chance.

We wish you a happy time and safe return. The letter from

Grant is indeed a treasure.

  With all regards to Mrs. Force and yourself from all here.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.



  July 8. Wednesday. -- Professor Orton, of the Ohio Uni-

versity, dined with us today. As one of the State geologists, he

is much interested in our quarries and in the gas well. The

gas has increased since at a little more than thirteen hundred

feet the Trenton limestone was struck, but there is not yet enough

to insure a useful quantity. In talking of the prospect of gas

as a substitute for coal, Professor Orton does not think enough

will be found. None is found at Wooster, Bucyrus, and many

other places. Findlay will perhaps use gas as the chief supply

of fuel. No other point as yet is likely to do so.

  July 15.  Wednesday. -- Heavy showers early in the morning

with thunder and lightning of unusual sort. At fifteen minutes

before six this morning we heard a loud sharp crack of thunder.

Lucy said, "That struck one of the oaks near the house." I

thought it was probably a quarter or half a mile distant. It turned

out that one of the largest white oaks in the orchard, about one

hundred yards west of the house, was struck and torn in a

most wonderful way. The tree is three to four feet in diameter;

was broken off about thirty or forty feet from the ground. The

tree below was split about through the centre down to the









<B>222         RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ground. The upper part of the tree fell into the cleft, the butt

projecting twenty-five or thirty feet on one side and the rest

of the top on the other.  It remains caught in the cleft perhaps

fifteen or twenty feet up. Fragments of the tree were thrown

one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet in all directions. A

piece of bark, forty feet long and almost two feet broad, was

thrown southwest forty feet.



                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 21, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I am very glad you are coming [for the un-

veiling of the Soldiers' Monument]. It will be an especial grati-

fication to all of us. You will stay with us, with Mamie, several

days we hope. Cannot Mrs. Sherman come also?

  All looks well for the affair. Senator Payne and Foraker will

probably be with us. Kennedy, Generals Morgan, Gibson, Cox,

Robinson, etc., etc., have accepted definitely.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    Mansfield, Ohio.

                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 23, 1885.

  MY  DEAR S--:--I have your most interesting letter.  The

question you ask is new in form, but not in substance. I have

often considered your fitness for the [historical] work you out-

line. I mean for such a work. Your talents, training, and work

all tend that way. In short--I must be short, my hands are

full, -- I am very glad indeed you have the task in mind. By

all means nurse it -- let it grow--give the country the benefit

of it. It will give you a great reputation.

  I will try to write something for the unveiling. I have just

written for a Loyal Legion meeting at Cincinnati tomorrow eve-

ning the enclosed (a copy). -- I expect to go East to the funeral

[of General Grant].

                 With all regard. Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.
