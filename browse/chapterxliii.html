   JULY  23.  Thursday.--I have just heard "General Grant

died at 8 A. M. this morning." I sent to N. E. Dawson,

Mount McGregor, New York: "Please assure Mrs. Grant and

the sorrowing family of the deep sympathy of Mrs. Hayes and

myself. I wish to attend the funeral. Advise me of the ar-

rangements.--R. B. Hayes."



                            FREMONT, OHIO, July 23, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I am sorry I cannot attend the special meet-

ing of the Ohio Commandery of the Loyal Legion at Cincin-

nati tomorrow evening.

  You did well to call the meeting. General Grant was the

most illustrious member of our society. As long as the annals

of our Republic last, he will be known and honored throughout

the world. He was the most illustrious soldier of the sacred

cause of Liberty and Union.

  The first large army of [the] Rebellion which laid down its

arms surrendered to Grant at Fort Donelson.  The veteran army

of Lee--the last hope of the Confederacy--gave Grant at the

Appomattox the decisive and crowning victory of the war.

  The two most formidable strongholds of the Rebels--one in

the West which dominated the Mississippi River, the other in

the East where it menaced the safety of our Capital, and held

at once the life and the government of the adversary--both

yielded to our matchless commander.

  With Donelson, with Shiloh, with Vicksburg, with Mission

Ridge, with Richmond, and with Appomattox on the list of his

                         <B>(223)</B>









<B>224          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



achievements, no soldier will fail to see that the military fame of

General Grant stands on the solid rock of great results.

  As a patriot he was prompt wise and sagacious. Read the

enclosed letter recently published in the Saint Louis Globe-

Democrat. How few of even our eminent statesmen had the

forecast shown by Grant on that second historic nineteenth of

April!

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  CAPTAIN A. H. MATTOX,

    RECORDER LOYAL LEGION,

      Cincinnati.





  July 24.  Friday.--I attended special meetings of each of

the posts of the G. A. R. last night and urged the building of

a national monument to General Grant in New York under the

leadership of the G. A. R. The proposition was favorably re-

ceived and here there is a strong disposition to act upon it.

Committees were appointed to inaugurate the movement. If

it fails, the money raised here may go to the completion of a

soldiers' record for Sandusky County to be placed in Sandusky

County.

  July 26. Sunday.--The interest in General Grant's death

has been very great. I spoke twice the evening of his death.

Once at the Eugene Rawson Post and once at the Manville

Moore Post, G. A. R. In both cases I urged in reference to a

monument or memorial structure: --

  1. Prompt action while the feeling on the subject is uni-

versal and warm.

  2. That the memorial be placed in New York, where Gen-

eral Grant last resided and where more soldiers and citizens

will see and enjoy it than would be the case [if it were placed]

in any other locality.

  3. That it be built by a union effort of all soldiers' societies

and all citizens in every part of the country.









             <B>THE DEATH OF GRANT          225</B>



  4. That the G. A. R., with its posts in all the States ready

organized for the work, should lead off by appointing commit-

tees in each G. A. R. post who will undertake to raise a sum

equal to at least one dollar for every member of their post.

This to be done by an appeal to all soldiers and to all citizens.

The sum raised to be as large as practicable in each instance,

with no limitation as to the amount of individual subscriptions

nor as to the aggregate amount to be raised.

  I am to speak this evening at a memorial meeting in the

Methodist Episcopal church. Let the memorial be worthy of the

Republic, worthy of General Grant, and worthy of the righteous

cause of which he was the most illustrious soldier. He was

simple, sincere, heroic, generous, magnanimous, of sound judg-

ment, self-poised, and with a tenacity of purpose rarely equalled.

  July 27.  Monday.--Last evening the Methodist Episcopal

church was packed full of people, all the aisles full--many

standing--the lecture-room thrown open and full of people,

attending the Grant memorial services. On the platform were

Revs. L. E. Prentiss, D. W. Cox, J. I. Swander, H. Lang, and

  ; General R. P. Buckland, W. W. Ross, F. S. White, and

myself. The last four were the speakers. It passed off in the

best possible way.



                             FREMONT, OHIO, July 28, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- I hope you will, on many accounts, strain a

point to come to our dedication. We can start from here Sun-

day or even Monday and reach Saratoga in time. If the prin-

cipal ceremony which we want to attend is the 4th, we can easily

reach there in ample time after our celebration. I hope, being

still in doubt, that we need not be present until the 8th.

  Fanny confidently counts on having a visit from Mamie. Can't

Mrs. Sherman come also?

                         Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

 HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.

Private.

                            FREMONT, OHIO, July 29, 1885.

  DEAR GENERAL:--I did not send you a copy of my note in

reply to your published letter, knowing you would get it in the

papers.

  I trust you will see your way clear to encourage the com-

rades in their posts to aid promptly in raising funds for the

proposed monument in New York. I do not discuss the place

chosen. It is enough that it seems to be settled that General

Grant will be buried in the city of his late residence and that a

monument will be there built.

  I had some experience in the difficulty of raising funds for

the Lincoln and also for the Garfield Monument. It was due:

-- 1. To the lack of prompt action. 2. To the great number

of rival projects in different localities. 3. To the difficulty of

getting up an organization in all parts of the country to make

collections.

  It occurred to me that it would be wise in this case to begin

at once; to concentrate in favor of the monument at the place

of the burial; and to employ as part of the collecting agency the

G. A. R. posts.

  Allow me to say that I fear a mistake will be made if the

authorities of the G. A. R. fail to encourage their comrades to

assist in the work, which will surely go on to completion, viz., the

building of a monument at the grave of General Grant. The

G. A. R. should not stand aloof but cordially cooperate.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--I mark this note "Private" merely to show that it is

not intended for publication. I have no special objection to its

being made public if there is any good reason for it. -- H.

  GENERAL S. S. BURDETTE.

    COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, G. A. R.



  August 2.  Sunday.--Our celebration and exercises on the

occasion of unveiling the Soldiers' Monument in Fort Stephen-

son passed off well. The town was beautifully decorated. The









             <B>THE DEATH OF GRANT          227</B>



speaking was good, the singing was superb, and the crowd was

immense. Nothing could have passed off better. The only dis-

appointment was that we were driven by a storm of rain to take

refuge in the Presbyterian church. This had the advantage of

enabling all who were fortunate enough to get into the church

to hear easily and with comfort the touching and charming ad-

dress of General Cox.

  At our house were ex-Governor J. D. Cox, Senator John

Sherman and daughter Mamie, Dr. A. C. Kemper (the poet)

and wife, General C. H. Grosvenor, wife and daughter Emma,

Captain J. L. Bottsford and wife, James Parmelee, and M. S.

Herrick. The above roomed with us. We also had at lunch

and dinner General Leggett, D. R. Locke ("Nasby"), Captain

Lemmon and wife, Kennedy and wife, J. L. Pease and his glee

club (four in all, or five), Clark Waggoner, [and] Captain Hop-

kins and wife. Our guests made us all very happy. They were

a rare gathering. Many of them staid with us Sunday. General

Cox tells of a name which is pronounced Darby and spelled

Enroughty!

  I go to the funeral of General Grant in New York the 8th with

Senator Sherman. A special invitation from General Hancock

was sent to me on the suggestion of the President.

  August 4. Tuesday. -- Prepared to save the remains of the

noble oak that was torn to pieces by lightning by trimming off

fragments, and getting it into a condition to bear vines and

flowers. I save the main stub with the top of the tree in the

crevice. This will show for many years what the stroke did.

  August 5.  Wednesday.--With Fanny to Mansfield.  Was

met at Mansfield by Mr. Sherman and his daughter Mamie.

Lunched at Sherman's. A perfectly tasteful and convenient

home he has made. Afternoon to Pittsburgh and New York.

Talked over many matters of the past with the Senator.

  August 6.  Thursday.  Fifth Avenue Hotel.--As I was go-

ing to return call of Senator Sherman, I met Colonel F. Grant,

Jesse, and their wives. They asked me to go with them to

lunch. I took Mrs. Sartoris. She spoke warmly of our interest









<B>228          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



[in] her father. Mrs. Grant is not here. She remains at Mount

McGregor. At the table were Mr. Arkell and Mr. and Mrs.

Creswell. Rather a cheerful party under the circumstances.

Mrs. Sartoris is indeed a very sweet woman. Mrs. Colonel

Grant, Ida, is very lovely. While we were in the hall General

Sherman, General Sheridan, and General Van Vliet called on

me. It is a sad yet interesting and not gloomy reunion.

  Senator Morrill called with Senator Sherman. He looks well.

Thinks the Administration is doing badly in many respects.

Manning has given up his financial duties to the United States

Treasurer, Jordan. Jordan is Tilden's man. Tilden is buying

gold. He bought a million of exchange a month ago. The

treasury difficulties are pressing--on silver question and others.

They are borrowing from the banks now to "shin along." He

[Morrill] is now seventy-five or more and sees the dark side.

  Edmunds, another tells me, is a confirmed--well, hard

drinker. "Blaine will hardly be able to get another nomination."

So thinks Sherman.





              NEW YORK, August 6, 1885. Thursday P. M.

  MY DARLING: -- I left Fanny as happy and charming as she

could be in the greatly improved and beautiful home of Senator

Sherman.

  We had a comfortable and interesting trip. I am put next

to the Grants. They occupy the northeast corner where you

received Mrs. Fish's ( ) guests and are shut off from the rest

of the house by a screen. I took Mrs. Sartoris out to lunch in

the Peabody dining-room, with the rest. Mrs. Grant remains

at [Mount] McGregor and may not come down. They are all

very cordial--regretted your absence. Mrs. Sartoris is very

charming and talks beautifully about her father. Mrs. Fred

Grant--"Ida" -- is also noticeably beautiful.  Fred looks more

and more like his father.  Sherman (the general) says he is the

counterpart of the father, but somewhat better-looking.

  We are told there is a great crowd visiting the remains at the

City Hall.









             <B>FUNERAL OF GENERAL GRANT          229</B>



  I may start home with Sherman a day or two earlier than I

expected. But I can't tell. The weather is perfect.--Men and

women servants all ask for you.

                 With best wishes and ever

                         Yours ever,

  MRS. HAYES.                                               R.



  August 7.  Fifth Avenue  Hotel, New  York.--Read  the

World and Tribune.  The raising [of] funds for the Grant mon-

ument goes on slowly. Prompt work is required. My suggestion

that the G. A. R. posts take it up has met with much general

favor, but the opposition of the commander-in-chief, General

Burdette, is in the way.

  Mr. Simon Stevens called; spoke of the selection of the bury-

ing-place of General Grant as in part due to his suggestion.

  "Gus" Shepard called.  His wife, my pretty cousin, Joanna,

will be at the house of Elliott [F. Shepard], one of the famous

Vanderbilt houses.  Hopes to get a recognition from me.  Most

willingly I will try to gratify her.

  General A. G. McCook and his brother, the preacher, with his

son. A cordial greeting of old friends!

  E. O. Odson, of Commercial Advertiser, wanted an interview.

Told him in a word I am here out of respect and regard for

General Grant. It is no occasion for an interview. He tried to

ask about my meeting the Grants, but without a word further, I

dismissed him. What will he make of it?

  About noon Senator Sherman came in; soon after General

Schofield and then General Sherman.  The conversation soon

drifted to General Grant. General Schofield in his terse, graphic

way told this: "Immediately, or soon, after Shiloh, Halleck

deprived Grant of all command. I chanced to go to his quarters

one evening and found him packing up, getting ready to go to

the rear--to St. Louis. He was in little quarters, not fit for

a sergeant. He had no desk but a board supported by two forked

sticks; a tallow candle in a split stick for a light. His trunk was

packed and he was bundling up his papers and tying them to-

gether. He was alone and gloomy. I said, 'What are you do-









<B>230          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ing? Where are you going?' He said, 'You know. There is

nothing for me here. I am not allowed to do anything here. I

am going to St. Louis.' He was much affected. He shed tears.

I said, 'Don't--you must not go. If you [go] you are for-

gotten. We are your friends,' meaning with myself Logan."

  August 8. Wednesday. -- Last evening rain was threatened.

The prospect now is favorable weather for the Grant funeral

today.

  I rode down Broadway yesterday afternoon with Bottsford

in a cab. We saw the long lines of people then going into the

City Hall to see the corpse. Called on the recorder of the New

York Commandery at 206 Broadway; rode out on the Battery;

crossed the Brooklyn Bridge. The adornments on the great

stores are expensive, but need color to give effect. The American

flag should be liberally displayed with the black. General Mc-

Millan says the city does not show as New Orleans would on a

similar occasion.

  Allen Thorndike Rice, of the North American Review, urged

me to write for his review.  He has a book on Lincoln--the

work of numerous friends of Lincoln, casual acquaintances even

giving their impressions.

  August 9.  Sunday.--Sherman left this morning early.  I

took breakfast with him, but will remain until tomorrow and go

on the New York Central.

  The great day passed off well; not hot for an August day

and with a good breeze blowing. In the morning I was shown

to the ex-Presidents' room, southeast corner Twenty-third Street

and Fifth Avenue, -- a good place to see the passing procession.

Soon ex-President Arthur came in and we met in a friendly way,

without any reserve or embarrassment on either side. General

Sharp seemed to be "his best man." During the morning

Rutherford Platt, John Mitchell, Jr., and a friend came in from

Columbus. They have been on Block Island and were brown

and red from exposure. They had bad news from General Has-

tings. Lungs bleeding. Dr. Fullerton gone to Bermuda on that

account. R. H. Platt will go there when Dr. Fullerton leaves.

  During the long waiting for the catafalque to reach Fifth









             <B>FUNERAL OF GENERAL GRANT          231</B>



Avenue from City Hall, Sherman and I called on President

Cleveland. Found him plain, sensible, natural; in all respects

well-appearing. His talk was friendly and assuring. My favor-

able impressions were all confirmed. He lacks experience, is

not a great man, but he intends and anxiously wishes to do well.

He is firm and sensible--good qualities in a President.

  Lamar [Secretary of the Interior], [Attorney-General] Gar-

land, and Bayard [Secretary of State] were all cordial and

friendly. I was introduced also to the Secretary of War [Wil-

liam C. Endicott] and to [Postmaster-General] Vilas. I saw

Manning [Secretary of the Treasury]. He looks wonderfully

like Cleveland, but lacks his open and honest [manner]. This is

perhaps fancy for I did not hear him speak.

  At a late hour, after two or three hours of waiting, the pro-

cession passed by until our place near the catafalque was reached.

We joined. President Arthur proved an excellent companion

for such a drive--five hours. The procession, perhaps fifty

thousand, with the lookers-on numbering more than half a mil-

lion. Van Voorhis (ex-Member of Congress), of Rochester, puts

it at over one million -- twenty-five thousand to the acre. Gen-

eral Wager Swayne puts it five deep on each side of the street,

or fifty thousand to the mile of distance, and calls it ten miles

or five hundred thousand.

  Was in all respects a success. There was good order and

propriety throughout. Often a very general clapping of hands

as Arthur and I passed, and our names constantly heard. When

the Ohio men in line were passed they greeted me with as de-

cided demonstrations as the occasion permitted. Only as we

approached the grave was there a decided feeling of the solemnity

of the occasion. The bands, as the carriages passed the soldiers

in line, played dirges -- the soldiers at present arms -- each band

taking up the sorrowful airs one after the other; the "uncounted

multitude," the ships in the Hudson, and the whole scene were

unspeakably impressive and affecting.

  Before reaching the grave, the governor of New York, finding

no one to conduct him to the grave, drove on past in a huff. Our

driver followed a moment when with some difficulty President

Arthur compelled him to turn around and go back. We got out









<B>232          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



and with the aid of the ever-ready police we soon got our places

at [the] grave. We stood on the left side of the cedar box in

which the remains were secured. The G. A. R. and the Method-

ist Episcopal ritual were used, and rapidly home to our hotel.

President Arthur spoke some kind words; a hearty good-bye and

we parted.

  Today I saw Sherman off early. Wade Hampton and he were

the only passengers in a "bus." I had a cheerful talk with the

Confederate cavalryman. He changed on some plausible excuse

into a cab ( ) before Sherman got in.

  Colonel J. C. Breckinridge came and took me to his rooms in

the Murray Hill Hotel--a beautiful and tasteful place. Mary

is well grown but slender and pale; not so rosy as our Fanny.

A pleasant long visit with them. What a cheery Charley O'Mal-

ley the colonel is!

  August 13. Thursday.--We have left of our monument

fund, including amount collected of citizens, over six hundred

dollars.  We will get up a creditable pamphlet of the proceed-

ings and speeches. We will make a collection of newspapers

touching the celebration. We ought to notice suitably the emi-

nent men who did not speak, as Waggoner, Follett, General

Beatty, and others. The pamphlet may open with a brief ac-

count of the proceedings which were had looking to the erec-

tion of a monument, the organization of the society, -- or should

this be at the close? Portraits of McPherson, Croghan, the

battle picture, the monument, etc., etc.  Close with the benedic-

tion. Give the names of the early settlers of this and neighbor-

ing county.



Private.                   FREMONT, OHIO, August 15, 1885.

   MY DEAR SIR:--I found your letter of the 4th instant wait-

 ing me on my return from New York. Its publication is, of

 course, proper. While I differ toto coelo from both your pre-

 mises and conclusions, I see that, admitting your views of the

 probabilities of the future, you are logical. I do not write this

 for publication. As I see it, you are misled by a temporay local

 delusion. General Grant's remains will forever rest on the banks









             <B>SITE OF GRANT MONUMENT          233</B>



of the Hudson, near where his family will continue to reside,

near where he last resided, where those nearest of blood to him

chose to bury him, and where in the presence of every depart-

ment of the Government, state and national, and with a million

of people taking part, he was placed to remain.  If I am right in

this respect     but I do not write to reargue the question, but

out of respect for you as commander-in-chief of the noblest

organization of soldiers the world ever knew.

  One thing I may add, whether one or many monuments are

to be built, all experience shows that the funds, if raised by

popular subscription, must be obtained at once. The golden

moment has already passed. Further delay imperils all.

  With all regard, personal and official

                           Sincerely,

  GENERAL S. S. BURDETTE,                         R. B. HAYES.

     COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, G. A. R.



  August 17.  Monday. -- Busy with an awful correspondence

on pensions, reunions, education, missions, prisons, and with

collection of materials for the unveiling pamphlet.



                                   SPIEGEL, August 17, 1885.

  MY DEAR AUNTY DAVIS:--The time for the yearly meeting

of the Woman's Home Missionary Society is drawing near.

Lucy is moved in conscience with the natural and just notion

that those who bear the cross should wear the crown. You do

the lion's share of the work.  You ought to be the nominal as

well as the real head. She wishes, therefore, to renew her tender

of resignation, and to ask for it your considerate attention. Un-

less you see decided reasons to the contrary, please allow this

to go as the paper; or I will have her send one more formal.

  We are all in usual health. The house has been well filled

of late; all the boys and girls alone with us yesterday, as happy

as Providence permits. The same we hope for you and yours.

                             Ever,

  MRS. E. G. DAVIS,                               R. B. HAYES.

    Cincinnati.









<B>234          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  August 22.  Saturday.--Lucy and Scott with me to Lake-

side. The fourteenth reunion of the Twenty-third O. V. I.

Our best reunion. By no means the grandest affair. But a most

enjoyable family meeting -- due, first, to the large number pres-

ent of the prominent officers: Colonel Stanley Matthews, General

Comly, Colonel Zimmerman, Captains Ellen, Bottsford, Warren,

"the best mayor Emporia, Kansas, ever had," [and] Lyon.

Second. Twelve of the old band with their instruments [pres-

ent].

  August 31.  Monday.--Lovely  morning.  The last day of

summer. The leaves and grass are almost as fresh as they were

in May or June. The lawn never was in such good condition.

  Miss Austine Snead and her mother, the well known Washing-

ton correspondents, arrived at 7 P. M. Ladies of good char-

acter who will regard the proprieties.





Private.

                          FREMONT, OHIO, August 31, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: -- The situation of the [Civil Service Reform]

League is certainly difficult and embarrassing. The impression

grows stronger daily that the spoils system is in fact in power

at Washington, held somewhat in check, however, by the sincere

repugnance of a reform President. The apprehension gains

strength that the league is in danger of becoming a mere annex

to a party which is essentially the spoils party.

  With the natural and proper desire to sustain the President,

there is a tendency to wink at the violations of principle which

are of daily occurrence.  Up to this time the league has not in

its publications and proceedings, so far as I have observed,

squarely met the issues presented. The spoils system under the

sham "offensive partisanship" is in full possession, unrebuked,

and almost unnoticed. The sweep is not rapid, but it will no

doubt be "clean." So far as it has gone we see the spoils sys-

tem pure and simple.

  P. S.--I do not propose to go off half-cocked. Please re-









             <B>BLACKBURN ON POTTER INQUIRY          235</B>



turn me the letter of Mr. Potts which I enclose, and also my

letter, which is only for your eye.<B>*</B>





  September 1.  Tuesday.--Miss  Austine Snead says Vice-

President Wheeler told her that Honorable R. C. Winthrop said

in all his acquaintance with ladies in other countries and in our

own, he had never [met] any one with such peculiarly attractive

manners as Mrs. Hayes.

  That Mrs. Bancroft said she had seen ladies of all high stations

in Europe and in this country and had never seen any lady

who was so well fitted for her place as Mrs. Hayes, as the

lady of the White House.

  Touching the Potter Committee and the effort to implicate

me in the frauds charged in relation to the election in Louisiana,

Miss Snead says she once said [to] Honorable Joe Blackburn,

of Kentucky, that she should lose faith in human nature if

President Hayes was found guilty. Blackburn replied promptly:

"You can keep your faith in human nature. We do not expect

to connect Hayes with anything wrong. We do expect to show

that Republican leaders and managers were guilty, and to collect

material to be used against them in the next election." This in

1878.

  September 4.  Friday.--With Lucy, Mrs. and Miss Snead

drove yesterday forenoon over to Green Spring. Under Dr.

Marshall, the "cure" is getting on well; more and more patients

and guests. Mrs. and Miss Snead pronounced the spring the

most beautiful they ever saw. Today Miss Snead showed me

her collection of scraps, etc., relating to United States

official seals. She has untiring industry and a taste for this sort

of investigation that enables her to trace to their origin the seals

now in use.

  September 5.  Saturday. -- Spent last evening with Mr. Rex-

ford, now of Syracuse, who came here with his father in 1815.

He will attend the pioneer meeting today.

<B>236          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  September 6.  Sunday.--The pioneer meeting at the court-

house yesterday was well attended and was very enjoyable. The

social feature, the lunch or picnic, and the greetings were happy.

The only prepared address was by Mrs. Downs; short, appro-

priate, and interesting. Her first coming to Fremont in 1841.

Mr. Rexford, of Syracuse, gave his first coming in 1815. Al-

bert Cavalier came, a child of six years of age, in 1812. Julius

Patterson some six years later. Mr. Tucker spoke well. Next

year we must have essays prepared. Also a complete list of the

pioneers of the county. Begin with the earliest. Also sketches

of all who die to be read.

  September 10. Thursday. -- Mrs. Snead and her daughter

Miss Austine ("Fay" and "Miss Grundy" of the press) leave

us today.

  September 11.  Friday. -- Major McKinley visited me.  He

is on a stumping tour, and came from Sandusky last evening

and spent the night with us. He said a great many pleasant

things, all tending to show a rapidly increasing appreciation of

my Administration and a diminishing tendency to abuse of me

personally.

  I criticized the bloody-shirt course of the canvass. It seems

to me to be bad "politics," and of no use. This, even supposing

it was sound in itself. The people are weary of it. It is a stale

issue. An increasing number of people are interested in good

relations with the South. This tends to keep alive animosities.

Two ways are open to succeed in the South: 1. A division of

the white voters. 2. Education of the ignorant. Bloody-shirt

utterances prevent division, etc.

  September 14. Monday.--The battle of South Mountain

was fought twenty-three years ago today! I think of it with

great satisfaction. The wound and Lucy's search after her hus-

band! What a flood of recollections comes to me! We go to

Columbus today, Lucy, Fanny, and self. Thence I go to Ports-

mouth to the reunion of the Army of West Virginia.

  September 16. Wednesday.--Reached Portsmouth about 11

A. M. Was heartily greeted by General B. F. Coates, Major









             <B>CHARACTER OF A. H. STEPHENS          237</B>



John W. Overturf, and others. Saw the business procession, and

was glad and surprised to see what a "Yankee town" Ports-

mouth has become.

  P. M. A glorious meeting in the monster tent in old Camp

Morrow. Colonel Turley welcomed; I responded offhand but

tolerably well. At night a rousing meeting; speeches, songs,

music, recitations. All good. In the absence of General Crook,

I presided.

  September 17. Thursday.--Ditto, ditto. I spoke on the

battle of Antietam, twenty-three years ago.--The last reunion

is still the best.



Private.

                       FREMONT, OHIO, September 25, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Absence from home has prevented an earlier

reply to your valued favor of the 15th instant.

  I first met Mr. [Alexander H.] Stephens in Washington at a

reception given him by General Grant in the winter of 1865-6.

During the time I was in Washington from 1877 to 1881, he was

a member of the House of Representatives, and I saw him often.

It has been truly said that of all the men who were prominent

in the support of the Confederacy, Mr. Stephens was regarded

by Union men at the North with the most favor and with the

least disposition to question the patriotism of his motives and

conduct after the conflict closed.  This sentiment was quite

general and was based on the amplest grounds. His talents, his

experience in public affairs, his moderation, his resolute inde-

pendence, and the indomitable spirit with which, in spite of

physical suffering and weakness, he devoted himself to duty

made him a very interesting and conspicuous figure in Congress

during all of the later years of his life. His influence was large

and always on the side of harmony and conservative action,

and this, when sectional and party animosity were almost uni-

versal.

  He did not overrate the importance of his course. In carry-

ing out the law creating the Electoral Commission in 1877, in

the struggles over the Potter investigation in 1878, and in the









<B>238          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



attempt to coerce the Executive by refusing appropriations, his

moderation, wisdom, and resolute conduct were controlling and

most beneficial. In your book it will be pertinent on these topics

to quote fully from his speeches in Congress, his letter to Mr.

Potter, May 28, 1878, and his private correspondence. A care-

ful collection of all of his utterances on these occasions will be

very attractive reading and will add to his fame. I presume

you will easily get hold of what you desire. If there is anything

I can furnish you, I will be glad to have copies made. His pri-

vate correspondence will, I trust, be at your command.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--Please put my name on the list of subscribers for

your book.

   [Unaddressed.]



Private.               FREMONT, OHIO, September 29, 1885.

   MY DEAR SIR:--I thank you for your conclusive article on

the Florida count in 1876-7. It is pungent, brief, and readable.

   I venture to make two suggestions. Your case, as you make

it, is, in its general scope, indisputable. All its statements of

 details may be also. But would the case not be as strong -- nay,

stronger--if every mere inference and every disputed state-

ment were omitted?

   Again, your statement that the failure to renominate the man

 claimed to be beaten by fraud gives away his case, cannot be

gainsaid. It is a conclusive reply to the "fraud cry." I merely

suggest that the nomination and election of Garfield emphasizes

this in the most cogent way. General Garfield was a conspicu-

ous figure in the whole business complained of. As a visiting

statesman to Louisiana, he reported to me, to the country, and

officially to the President, that the final result in Louisiana was

 not merely fair and just, but according to the law and equity

 of the case. He was placed on the Electoral Commission and

on all questions voted with the majority. He was in the fullest

sense responsible for the result. His nomination and election

clinched the business.









             <B>CHANDLER ON FLORIDA COUNT          239</B>



  Again, General Hancock, who was nominated by the Demo-

crats in 1880, was distinctly identified with the liberal wing of

his party, who scouted the whole charge of fraud, and with

Alexander H. Stephens he agreed. Before the controversy was

ended in favor of the Republicans, he published a letter in which

he said he "knew Governor Hayes well as a soldier in the war;

that he would make a good President"; and when the result was

declared he did not sulk, but was among the first, after inaugu-

ration, who promptly paid his respects to the new President.

                With best wishes. Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WM. E. CHANDLER,

    Concord, New Hampshire.



  September 30. Wednesday. -- I will today gather a number

of books for library of the Loyal Legion. We ought to make

up a library of the books each member feels a particular interest

in--the books which contain an account of the operations of

the command each member belonged to.

  October 4. Sunday. -- My birthday -- three score and three

years old. All the boys and Fanny at home today. Mrs. Jewett

also with us.  Fanny  today  joins the Methodist Episcopal

church.

  October 7. -- With Lucy and Fanny left home at 11.30 A. M.

[Monday, October 4,] for Farmington and New York. Miss

Carter, of Honolulu, we found on the train, as we anticipated,

from Toledo. At Cleveland were joined by Miss Mary Good-

loe, daughter of Colonel William Cassius Goodloe, of Lexington,

Miss Lucy Platt, my ward, and Miss Hayden of Columbus.

Also Colonel Herrick and Mrs. Herrick.  Webb and Parmelee

got on the train at the foot of Superior Street. A pleasant trip

to Westfield on Boston and Albany Railroad. There parted with

Colonel and Mrs. Herrick and Miss Hayden. In less than an

hour took cars through Simsbury (the pleasant home of my an-

cestors) to Farmington. A dismal rain made this place look its

worst.  We packed into the stage [and] drove to the headquar-

ters of the Miss Porter School. Thence we went to the Old









<B>240          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Elm-tree Inn--a quaint old place; dined and returned to look

after Fanny and the other girls from whom we parted at Miss

Porter and Mrs. Dow's house.

  We went over to the dwelling in which the girls were to room.

Fanny was in a tender and saddened mood. She shed some natu-

ral tears. She is to room with Miss Bulkley, of Hartford. No

other girls had yet arrived. At 3:30 P. M. we bid good-bye to

the dear girl with some shadows over us. On the train to New

Haven met Samuel Hayes, a distant relative. Reached New

York about 7 P. M. Had left the checks for our baggage with

the driver at Farmington. With some difficulty got them at the

Grand Central Depot by the deposit of one dollar.

  At Fifth Avenue Hotel were soon in the pleasant old quarters

41 and 42.--at home "in mine inn"--a favorite place.

  At the Old Elm Inn in Farmington Lucy met some acquain-

tances of Washington days. A merry greeting with the hand-

some white-haired old lady.

  We came to New York to attend the meeting of the Pea-

body trustees. A notable meeting [today] Wednesday. 1. The

death of General Grant and the death of Mr. Wetmore create

vacancies in the board of trustees. 2. General Jackson, of

Georgia, appointed by President Cleveland Minister to Mexico,

has resigned. 3. The President has appointed Dr. Curry, our

general agent, Minister to Spain, and he resigns.

  Mr. Winthrop in his elaborate way, as a scholarly orator

of the olden time, presented all of these matters to the board.

His address was well received. In the board there was a party

discussion on filling the vacancy of General Grant. The Chief

Justice presented the name of General Sherman. Governor Por-

ter, or some one, named President Cleveland, and Mr. Drexel

named Governor Wetmore, of Rhode Island. Two ballots were

had. First, President Cleveland, six, General Sherman, five,

Governor Wetmore, two. No choice. Second ballot, President

Cleveland, seven, General Sherman, six. Probably a party vote.

Evarts, Waite, Fish, and self for General Sherman; the other

[two] I do not know. Governor Fish seemed vexed. He said

to me, "There is too much party in our body." I was quite

willing to see President Cleveland chosen, but not over General









             <B>TILDEN AND CIPHER DISPATCHES          241</B>



Sherman. I had thought of the President as a probable mem-

ber and regarded it with favor.  But to succeed General Grant,

General Sherman did seem to be the right person.

  Mr. Pierpont Morgan was chosen to fill Wetmore's vacancy

before the ballot for the President.

  I asked Mr. Fish (the governor), what was the opinion of

the well-informed in New York as to Tilden's knowledge of

the cipher despatches. He replied that no one acquainted with

Mr. Tilden's methods and character had any doubt of his

knowledge and connection with them; that he was intimately ac-

quainted with Tilden more than forty years ago; that he was

bright, fond of philosophizing about politics, and always inter-

esting. That their offices were near together.

  I told Governor Fish that in 1876, when the Cincinnati con-

vention was in session, my friend in Cincinnati sent me word

that I could have the Vice-Presidency. I wrote in reply that

having the support of my State for President I would not ac-

cept the Vice-Presidency on the ticket with any of my com-

petitors for the Presidency; but that if for the good of the

party the convention should drop all the candidates and take

up Governor Fish for the Presidency, in case they wanted me

for Vice-President on such a ticket, I would accept.

  October 9.  Friday.--Reached Farmington about 6 P. M.

Fanny took tea with us at the Elm-tree Inn. After tea called at

Miss Dunning's; saw all the girls there (nine I think). At the

"Inn" saw Miss Hammond, of Memphis--daughter of Judge

Hammond; same name, of St. Paul. Mollie Garfield, we saw

also. Called at Miss Porter's -- a fine old lady with her sisters.

  October  10.  Saturday.--Lovely weather.  Farmington is

looking its handsomest. The colors are more brilliant than

usual. About noon took the cars for Westfield. Passed through

Simsbury. Met the postmaster of Westfield, also the Demo-

cratic candidate for Auditor of State--Delaney--mayor of

Holyoke; introduced himself and gave me his political history!

After two hours at Westfield we went on to Pittsfield.  Stopped

three hours; called on Senator and Mrs. Dawes. Had a hearty

   16









<B>242          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



welcome and tea. After a very enjoyable visit, at 8:30 (P. M.)

took the limited express [for home].

  October 13, 1885. Tuesday.- Raining a little. Not a bad

election day. My notion of the result is formed without much

knowledge of the facts in debate. On general principles, the

Republicans should have the advantage.

  1. Democrats are not content with the Administration of

Cleveland. It is too conservative- too much leaning to the

civil service reformers; too little "spoils" for the "boys."

  2. The corrupt use of money in conventions and in the

Legislature by "the McLean-Coal Oil Combination" is not popu-

lar; ought to be condemned by a decided majority.

  Per contra: -1. The Prohibition party is gaining in num-

bers at the expense of the Republicans.

  2. The canvass has been made on the "bloody-shirt" line.

A mistake, as I see it. My guess is, we win the election by a

close vote.

  If prohibition gets not over fifteen thousand, our chance is

good. If over twenty-five thousand, we lose. I guess prohibi-

tion gets about sixteen to eighteen thousand and that we have

a plurality of five thousand.

  October 14.  Wednesday. - The election seems to be a decided

Republican victory - more decided than I hoped for. .

  October 17. Saturday.- I write this at Detroit. I came up

yesterday to attend the National Prison Congress. Was met at

the station by Mr. Barber; came with him to the Russell House.

I find here an excellent attendance. Much interest by citizens'

committees. Governor Baldwin took me driving in the after-

noon. Detroit has a solid growth and is a beautiful and very

prosperous city. In the evening, at Whitney's Opera House, had

a good opening meeting. Father Riley, in canonicals (?) opened

[it] with prayer. Bishop Harris, Bishop Gillespie, and Bishop

Robertson were present. Senator Palmer and Judge Campbell

delivered good welcoming addresses. I responded. Professor

Wayland, Senator Jones, and Mr. Round also spoke briefly.









             <B>ADVICE TO GOVERNOR FORAKER          243</B>



  October 18. Sunday.--At Saint Paul's, Bishop Robertson,

of Missouri, preached a solid sermon, full of sterling points in

favor of the National Prison Association.

  October 22.  Thursday. - From Detroit to Toledo with Gen-

eral Brinkerhoff, of Ohio, and Dr. Morris, of Baltimore, on

early train. With General Brinkerhoff and Mr. Carrington vis-

ited the Insane Asylum; new (cottage system) buildings going

up rapidly. Lunched with Carrington and [family] and General

Brinkerhoff. An agreeable time.- Home in the evening.





                         FREMONT, OHIO, October 24, 1885.

  MY DEAR MAJOR:--I find your letter here on my return

from Michigan.

  I have said to a number of good friends, competent and

worthy, that I must not intervene in any case, it is so hard to

discriminate between one's friends.     So I am  committed to

neutrality - to treating all alike.

  You know I think of M- and feel toward him as you do.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MAJOR W. D. BICKHAM,

    Dayton.



  October 25. Sunday. --I want to say to Foraker: Don't un-

derrate the office you are chosen to fill. Without large powers

under the law, you have great opportunities by influence to

benefit the State and to strengthen your party. This too will

redound to your own permanent popularity and reputation.

  1. Take the leadership of your party in the Legislature. See

that it acts promptly and wisely on the temperance question.

Reinstate the Scott Law.

  2   On the question of submitting an amendment in favor of

single districts for the election of members of the Legislature:

With the help of the Prohibition party such an amendment can

be adopted.









<B>244          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  3. See what the State needs. Set yourself actively at work

in favor of reforms, institutions, laws.

  4. Do not assume, or lecture, or protest, but in fact make

yourself felt on the right side regardless of consequences.





                        SPIEGEL, Sunday, October 25, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--Birch and Scott came home last night. But

the home is lonely without you. You do not know your value.

Be uplifted as you think of it.- I am glad to see you got off

your speech successfully.

  We had a severe frost yesterday morning--the first of the

season. It curled up the last fresh leaves of the caladium, and

dimmed the brilliant row of red. All flowers and leaves are

wilted or rusted by it. And yet on the whole the place never

looked finer than yesterday. We saw nothing equal to our trees

in New York or New England. I hardly know which was

finest. The "twin oaks," with all their leaves still perfect, were

of a deep dark crimson, and when we looked at them they were

finest. The stub with its glorious woodbine was hardly second

to anything. The maples, one at the south end of the verandah,

and the one in front, especially, seemed to ray out golden and

rosy glory. - Come home before all the beauties are gone.

  Notwithstanding the Hamilton County fraud, Sherman is un-

doubtedly safe, thanks to Ross County and a few others.

  All well. Fanny writes cheerfully.

                        Affectionately,

                                                        R.

  MRS. HAYES,

    Philadelphia.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, October 25, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: -No household that I can think of in the

State feels a deeper interest in your success than this one. We

all rejoice exceedingly, and unite in warmest congratulations to

you, to Mrs. Sherman, and to Mamie. It is all that we hoped

for. Don't feel obliged to acknowledge this.

  I assume that the House will either never seat the fraudu-









             <B>THE GOSPEL OF WORK          245</B>



lent members from Hamilton at all, or that they will oust them

inside of twenty-four hours.

                          Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.





  October 26. Monday.--I went over rapidly with Colonel

Haynes and General Buckland the compilation I have made

from the newspapers for the pamphlet of proceedings at the

unveiling of the Soldiers' Monument. They approve it. Mr.

Lamberson, editor of the Democrat, who is to publish, was

absent from town. Nothing done except to order a photograph

of the monument and library. . I must push this now to a con-

clusion.

  October 27.  Tuesday.--The  Republicans in Congress will

make a serious mistake if they do not insist on the admission

of Dakota with its half million of people and Washington with

its two hundred thousand. This would give four Senators to

the Republicans --six, if Dakota is divided--and six to ten

electoral votes. The Senate should pass bills immediately. If

the House fails or refuses to pass them, then there will be an

issue worth having. It will be the Rebel brigadiers refusing

representation to hundreds of thousands of intelligent and loyal

white men--hardy pioneers who are facing the hardships and

perils of the wilderness and adding untold millions to the wealth

of our country.

  October 28. Wednesday. - I preach the gospel of work. I

believe in skilled labor as a part of education: - 1. It promotes

health of body. 2. It trains and strengthens the mind. 3. It

builds up character--good habits, independence, courage, per-

severance, self-control.

  I met at Detroit a number of men worth remembering - men

who would be notable in any circle.

  Charlton F. Lewis, of New York, a lawyer by profession, grad-

uated at Yale--one of the ablest men of the class of 1853.

President White, Wayne MacVeagh, and others, classmates. Re-









<B>246          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



puted one of the finest Greek scholars of our country; a superior

mathematician; certainly, an orator of power. He delivered

an address on the English which was in matter, style, and de-

livery simply superb. He writes well, rapidly, with ease. I

put him down as the most noticeable person I saw in Detroit

He has a young wife -younger than some of his children.  She

was one of his family, treated as a daughter.  His first wife on

her death-bed regretted that - had not been adopted as a

daughter; she couldn't see how he would get along without her.

Mr. Lewis solved the difficulty by, in a suitable time, marrying

the orphan girl.

  Mr. Lewis told this story - mothers-in-law being the topic.

The joke about mothers-in-law is older than the Christian era

In Greece two thousand or more years ago this story is told:

"A threw a stone at a fox, but Fortune is often wiser than the

purposes of man. The stone missed the fox and hit A's mother-

in-law." A cruel sarcasm. My mother-in-law was angelic in

temper and conduct.

  October 29. Thursday. - Wrote to [M. F.] Round author-

izing the use of my name to his National Prison Association cir-

cular.

  Mr. Eugene Smith of New York, lawyer, is a sincere and

earnest friend of the prison cause. His paper at Detroit on

jails - "County Jails" -was excellent.  His wife is a daughter

of Rev. Dr. Bacon, of New Haven, and is intelligent and bright

-worthy of her lineage. The drift of Eugene Smith's paper

was to show that jails were training-schools for crime--com-

pulsory under the law, and at the public expense. He conclu-

sively showed the grave and fatal defects of our whole jail

system. The remedy is, jails in which there is complete isola-

tion of the prisoners,- "the Ohio Jail," so-called, unfortunately

rarely found even in Ohio. The [Prison] Congress resolved

against these jails.

  October 30. Friday.- Lucy returned from Philadelphia this

morning.  ..  . Our good friend Tom  Donaldson was most

attentive and thoughtful. He is zealous, fond, and "loyal" to

the Hayes [Hayeses]. He sent me an autograph letter of









             <B>JAILS, CRIME TRAINING-SCHOOLS          247</B>



Colonel George Croghan, a South Carolina memorial volume on

Calhoun, "Life of John W. Bear," the Buckeye blacksmith, and

Pennypacker's "Biographical Sketches."





                                SPIEGEL, November 1, 1885.

  MY  DEAR DAUGHTER:-. . . Do  moderate your surplus

energy. It is well to ride, but hardly necessary to rack your

bones so dreadfully.    .  .   Your mother had a most satis-

factory journey going and coming, and a happy visit at Phila-

delphia,- one of her best affairs of the sort.

  I go to the Loyal Legion monthly at Cincinnati, Tuesday.

It is always an agreeable meeting. I see Force, Herron, and

other old friends; and at least, equally gratifying, my favorite

lady friends, Mrs. Herron and Aunty Davis. The legion has

taken the place of the club--the famous Cincinnati Literary

Club - in my affections. In the club I meet only Herron, Mal-

lon, and Force of the old set. The chairs are all well filled

with nice and interesting young fellows, but they are of recent

times, and "knew not Joseph." The military circles are inter-

ested in the same things with myself, and so we endure, if not

enjoy, each other.

  With all good wishes.

                  Affectionately, your father,

                                                        H.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Farmington.



  November 9. Monday. - Attended the Loyal Legion at Cin-

cinnati at "The  Hotel  Emory,"  [last Wednesday  evening].

General Cox read a capital paper on his campaign in Virginia

- West Virginia.  A good visit with old friends - the Herrons,

Mrs. Davis, the Forces, and Mrs. Stephenson.

  Lunched with our new Governor Foraker and McKinley.

        McKinley is a friend worth having.  Home Saturday.

  Last night Rev. Mr. Prentiss gave us a good address on the

Bible before the County Bible Society. I must sometime main-









<B>248          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tain my proposition that a non-professor of religion - "a mere

man of the world"--who  wishes well to his country and his

fellow men ought actively to aid in the circulation of the Bible,

and in adding to its influence. The general course of my argu-

ment is this: All peoples will have some religion. Death leads

the mind to consider the future, to a contemplation of Deity.

Hence religion, or this is religion. Now, the best religion the

world has ever known is the religion of the Bible. It builds

up all that is good. It suppresses or diminishes all that is bad.

With it men are happy and nations are prosperous.  Where it is

not found vice and crime prevail.





                        FREMONT, OHIO, November 9, 1885.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--I am ever so glad to get your letter,

and that the trinket hits the nail on the head--that it is pleas-

ant to you.

  As to talk about Grant's talk. I have a notion on the whole

business of repeating conversations in print that were not in-

tended for publication. No man ought to do it, except under

great pressure, because no man can do it. Take the Andy John-

son affair, the Depew sensation. No doubt, wisely looked at,

both Depew and Johnson's private secretaries are truthful.

Johnson would have attempted a revolution - putting in a Rebel

Democratic Congress and putting out the loyal lawful Con-

gress, if he had dared to do it. He would have dared to do it

if Grant would have stood by him. But not daring to do it, he

never intended to do it-- never seriously thought of doing it.

Both sides are, in a sense, correct. So don't get into the always

questionable position of relating to the public conversations not

meant for the newspaper. Instead of this, one can always assert

his belief, on his own responsibility, that so and so is truth.

But leave it to the "thin-brained" to quote from memory con-

versations of long ago.

  What a goose I am to write this old-woman talk to you.

                         Sincerely,

                                             R. B. HAYES.









             <B>PERIL OF REPEATING PRIVATE TALK          249</B>



  P. S.-For example, our friend Lee made a mistake in

quoting Grant's strong expressions. He can't quote the qualifi-

cations, the context, the provocations. How much of it all was

hypothetical ? - H.

                     CLEVELAND, OHIO, November 11, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--I came here yesterday afternoon to preside

--so-called (it means to sit in a conspicuous seat in the centre

of the auditorium, and at the time that more light is needed

touch a button that by electricity illuminates the hall) -at the

musical festival in the new hall.  We are so well pleased that

I have sent for your mother to come down. . . .

  I hope you are very happy and [that] you love me about

one thousandth part as much as I love you.

                Affectionately, your father,

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Farmington.



  November 15. Sunday. - Chaplain [Ambrose] Hollinston [of

the One Hundred Eleventh] preached two capital sermons.-

Among other pleasant things said to me, he said: "My brother

and I heard you in 1875 at West Unity when you were can-

vassing for governor. After your speech was finished, when

brother and I met, we both said with one voice 'He ought to be

the next President.' "

  November 17.  Tuesday. - This afternoon a young gentleman

who was visiting us, R. W. Huntington, of Norwalk, said he

wanted me to know the arrangement he had been making with

Adda (Adda S. Cook, "our niece" -a cousin of Mrs. Hayes)

-that he was going to Florida to engage in the pine lumber

business, and before going he had wanted to have an under-

standing with her, etc., etc. He is an intelligent gentleman of

good appearance, and apparently of good character, and talents.

I know nothing of his "prospects" or business capacity. The









<B>250          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



indications are however all favorable, except I have no reason

to suppose he has accumulated enough to warrant him in as-

suming the responsibility of a family. But a manly, independent

character is worth, in such cases, a great deal, and I am there-

fore inclined to congratulate Adda on her good fortune.

  November 19.  Thursday. - Henry Howe, author of "Ohio

Historical Collections" and other similar works, came yesterday

from New Haven, and leaves here for Cincinnati this morning.

His design is to get up another Ohio work- a reprint of the

first with illustrations and additions, bringing the story down by

pictures and text to the present day. It will be interesting to

compare the present with forty years ago. My only doubt is

as to his vigor. At seventy the powers of mind remain, but

physical strength is hardly adequate for such work as he did

when he was thirty.





                     SPIEGEL, Sunday, November 22, 1885.

  MY DARLING:--At breakfast this morning your box was one

of the topics. I think Adams Express will be called on to take

you the food, so that you may expect it about Thursday or a

little before.

  Adda had a successful lunch party Friday.  .  .   By the

by -in strict confidence--now, what do you think is coming?

Mr. Huntington has gone to Missouri- thence to Florida, and

leaves his sweetheart in Spiegel Grove for the present!! I like

him- am not well informed as to his "prospects" -that is what

we call dot or dower if the lady is named. But if Adda is con-

tent, we, of course, must approve. He is certainly a young gen-

tleman of good culture and abilities.

  We expect the Austin tribe to be with us Thanksgiving.  This

includes Webb. - Hoping all good angels will guard and keep

our darling Sister, I remain,

                     Your loving father,

                                                        H.

             <B>DEATH OF HENDRICKS          251</B>



  November 24. Tuesday. - The first quarterly conference held

this evening.  .   . After church the quarterly conference of

the [Presiding] Elder, pastor, and fifteen members of the offi-

cial board was held. The question of salary was the leading

point. I carried an advance, viz., twelve hundred dollars per

year instead of one thousand dollars. Two were reluctant--

possibly opposed.

  November  26.  Thursday. -The  sudden  death  of  Vice-

President [Thomas A.] Hendricks recalls his fine traits of per-

sonal character and the friendly acts towards myself which have

been from time to time done by him. Returning from Washing-

ton to the West in 1865-6, when he was Senator and I a Mem-

ber of the House, we had long and agreeable talks on public

affairs and personages. He was amiable, interesting, and

friendly. When I was governor he visited Columbus, probably

a number of times. He always called and in cordial ways and

greetings was always very friendly. In 1878 or '9, after the angry

contest of 1876, when many were still talking of not condoning

the [decision of] 1876, he called on me at the Grand Hotel in

Cincinnati and greeted us at our reception.

  Possibly more significant still was his greeting at the time

of General Grant's funeral, and his interview with "Gath," the

correspondent of the Enquirer.

  November 27.  Friday. - Mr. Hendricks had some great ad-

vantages over his rivals in public life. He was a man of blame-

less private life, a consistent member of the Episcopal Church,

an amiable, friendly man of even temper, kind impulses, and

generous conduct. A sound and able lawyer, a good citizen, and

a gentleman on all occasions. I wrote, but did not send a dis-

patch, expressing my esteem and regard for him and my wish

to attend the funeral.    I did send the following to General

Benjamin Harrison: -

  "Please tender to Mrs. Hendricks the heartfelt sympathy of

Mrs. Hayes and myself in her great sorrow."

  I now expect to attend the funeral.

                             FREMONT, November 28, 1885.

  MY DEAR COLONEL:--I look to the healing influences of time

and popular education to bring the sections and races into good

relations. Wherever I look I see in the South encouraging prog-

ress. Elections and politics in this country correspond with

battles and war in other times and countries. Whatever of de-

parting evils remains is sure to show itself lost in the excite-

ments of political contests. I am fully persuaded that their end

is coming.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  COLONEL A. J. KELLAR,

    Memphis.



  November 29.  Sunday. -Turned out a beautiful day.  "All

the boys" at home. We go to Indianapolis tomorrow to the

funeral of the Vice-President, Mr. Hendricks. In addition to

the respect due the office, and my esteem and regard for him

as a man, I have a feeling that his generous way of dealing with

"the fraud issue" lifts him above the narrowness and bitterness

of the average partisan. He habitually said:--"I always stand

up for Hayes. He could not have done otherwise than take

the place of President after we gave it up to him. I don't be-

lieve in assailing him for doing it."

  December  [7].--Monday  [November 30] with Colonel Wil-

liam E. Haynes, I went via Wellington to Indianapolis to attend

the funeral of Vice-President Hendricks. The Vice-President

had always been very kind in his acts and words towards me

personally. In particular on the fraud issue. He was in pri-

vate character a most exemplary and estimable gentleman. In

respect for the office also, I felt bound to attend - it being near

enough to do so without great inconvenience. I am in [a] quiet

way criticized by extreme partisans. Governor Noyes, at the

Loyal Legion meeting, said to me: "I see you were at the

funeral of that-old Copperhead, Hendricks."

  I was glad to meet on the train Senator Palmer of Michigan.

We had a most agreeable afternoon and evening with him. At









             <B>CHARACTER OF HENDRICKS          253</B>



the depot in Indianapolis we were met by Colonel William R.

Holloway [brother-in-law of Governor Morton], General Har-

rison, Judge Niblack, and others (a committee), with carriages,

and taken to the Denison Hotel.  We met many agreeable ac-

quaintances and made some new ones. I was specially in charge

of Mr. Volney T. Malott. He struck me as a man of unusual

business capacity, and a man of high character. He is president

of the Indiana National Bank and a member of the Methodist

Episcopal Church. He has an agreeable family; two of his

daughters were at Miss Porter's school at Farmington.

  Judge -[Martindale(?)] and family were particularly

agreeable. I there met Honorable E. B. Washburne and wife.

A pleasant evening. Mrs. Morton, widow of the Senator, is

not in firm health.  She does not go into society.  She still

mourns her loss and spends much time decorating her husband's

grave and statue. The son at home [Oliver] is an editor of the

Times. He seems to be a young gentleman of talents.

  I went with Haynes and others, by invitation of Mr. Ingalls

[president of the "Big Four" Railway] in his private car, to

Cincinnati Friday morning. A delightful meeting of the Loyal

Legion in the rejuvenated Burnet House.

  December 8. Tuesday. - Returned yesterday after three days

in Toledo.  Friday evening and Saturday-day and evening-

the convention in the interest of industrial education was held

in the hall of the high-school building near Madison Street. It

was a most successful meeting. Capital addresses were made

by Felix Adler, Colonel Jacobson, Dr. Woodward, Mr. Ham,

Mrs. Ewing, and others who represent schools at St. Louis, New

York, Chicago, etc., etc.

  I spent the whole day replying to letters that have accumu-

lated during my absence. This is getting to be a great burden.

The most of the letters I get are of such a nature that I wish to

answer them. It is not a diminishing flood. I must try to

adopt some rule that will relieve me.  Possibly printed forms.

  December 9.  Wednesday.-I am greatly gratified today by

receiving from Colonel Fred D. Grant a fine copy of General

Grant's (first volume) "Personal Memoirs" with this inscrip-









<B>254          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



tion, "Sent by the direction of General U. S. Grant and with the

compliments of his family.- F. D. Grant."

  This is a souvenir of the great man, direct from his own hand

in his dying hours.



               SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, December 10, 1885.

  MY DEAR COLONEL.--I am  in receipt from you of the first

volume of an elegant copy of your father's intensely interesting

and very valuable "Personal Memoirs."  Nothing could be more

prized by me than this precious token of your father's friend-

ship, and of the good will of yourself and the rest of his family

  I have read with liveliest interest the first one hundred and

twenty pages. If anything could add to the fame of General

Grant, it would be such a book from his pen.  It is graphic and

simple and as truthful as truth itself. It furnishes in sufficient

detail a capital picture of the life of one in whom the world

will always be deeply interested.

  A few sentences on pages 99 and 100 describe as far as they go

General Grant himself, although written of General Taylor:

"No soldier could face either danger or responsibility more

calmly than he."

  I beg you to present the kindest regards of Mrs. Hayes and

myself to your mother.

  With thanks and best wishes.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  COLONEL F. D. GRANT.



  December 11.  Friday.- I read in the Spirit of the Times,

San Francisco, the plan and details of Governor Leland Stan-

ford for his magnificent foundation of the Leland Stanford

Junior University in California. It surpasses anything hereto-

fore done in the world. He gives over five millions in land--

a great deal of it productive. It embraces the largest vineyard

known--several  thousand  acres in superb condition.  It is

stated that he will add to this enough to make the total founda-

tion twenty million dollars.









             <B>LELAND STANFORD'S BENEFICENCE          255</B>



  Mrs. Hayes [and I] are indebted largely to Governor Stan-

ford for our enjoyment of the finest trip of our lives - our Cali-

fornia trip in 1880.



      SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, December 12, 1885.

  MY DEAR GOVERNOR: - I read yesterday in the San Francisco

Spirit of the Times the first full account I have seen of your

matchless gift to the cause of education. I cannot resist the

impulse I feel to thank you and congratulate you. I must try

to express in a word or two the admiration of all good and

thoughtful people for you and your work. The Leland Stanford

Junior University will have the amplest endowment ever known.

It will be non-sectarian. It will provide for industrial educa-

tion. All of these features will attract commendation.  The last,

viz., manual training, I rejoice to see is fundamental. Its im-

portance, in this country especially, cannot be overstated. No

American can be regarded as well educated who cannot earn his

living as a skilled laborer, either in agriculture or in the useful

or ornamental arts. But I must not occupy your time.

  Mrs. Hayes and myself will always remember gratefully your

abundant kindness to us in the most enjoyable journey of our

lives, our California trip in 1880. We have sympathized deeply

with you in your great affliction and now join with all the world

in appreciation of what you are doing.

  We have never met Mrs. Stanford but venture to unite in re-

spectful and kind regards to her as well as to yourself.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GOVERNOR LELAND STANFORD,

    San Francisco.



             SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, December 13, 1885.

  MY DARLING:- The household are happy to know that you

are coming soon, and that you also look forward to the reunion

of the family with such agreeable anticipations. You may be

sure that the old home will welcome you warmly - perhaps up-

roariously - with as many of your schoolmates as you may like









<B>256          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to invite. They may come on their way back to school or with

you or both, as you and they prefer. The hospitality of "Spie-

gel" is plain and old-fashioned, but abounding and hearty....

  We are counting the days too. Be good and keep well.

                 Affectionately, your father,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Farmington.





  December 14.  Monday.--Attended executive committee of

the County Bible Society, and arranged for canvass of the town

and so much of the county as lies within the jurisdiction of the

society.

  Read Sherman's "Memoirs" on the battle of Shiloh, and on

Grant's intention to leave the army at Corinth and how it was

prevented by Sherman. - Also Hamilton's account of the trouble

at time of Adams dealing with French question in 1797-8.

  December 17. Thursday.-The funeral of Captain Josiah

Chance. The G. A. R. and a few companions of the Loyal

Legion made it significant as a military funeral. He was in

the regular army. In younger days a member of a band here.

Afterwards a bugler for the body-guard of Lincoln.

At the cemetery the G. A. R. took possession.  Rev. Mr. Barnes

as chaplain and Green as commander read the G. A. R. funeral

service.  The singing by Mrs. Stahl and        was  impressively

beautiful. A finer burial service I never saw. It was far better

than at General Grant's funeral. Touching, appropriate, and

effective in all respects.

  December 20. Sunday. -- Harper's Weekly in a fair and lauda-

tory notice of Sherman says: -"It was by his (Sherman's)

advice that President Hayes vetoed the first silver bill, in a mes-

sage generally credited to Mr. Sherman, which was one of the

strongest financial state papers in our history."

  I have noticed with regret during the last three years a disposi-

tion in Mr. Curtis to disparage my ability. The insinuation about









             <B>VETO OF SILVER BILL          257</B>



the veto message is wrong throughout. Mr. Sherman was op-

posed to the silver bill, but after it passed by majorities in both

houses so strong that it was evident that a veto would not kill, he

was inclined to think a veto might be omitted as unavailing. No

line of the message was his. I wrote all of my veto messages

except one. <B>*</B> In the case of the silver bill, Mr. Evarts was con-

sulted freely and his opinion coincided fully with mine. If

any one's advice was specially given it was his.





                       FREMONT, OHIO, December 21, 1885.

  MY DEAR SIR: - Perhaps I ought not to trouble you with this.

The last Harper's Weekly says, in its notice of you, many good

things - none of which could be said more strongly than I would

say them. But it says of the veto of the Silver Bill:--

  "It was by his (Sherman's) advice that President Hayes ve-

toed the first silver bill, in a message generally credited to Mr.

Sherman, which was one of the strongest financial state papers in

our history."

  I never heard this suggestion before. I hardly know how to

correct it. Perhaps you will see no objection to sending me a

short paragraph correcting the error. I could show it to Mr.

Curtis and let him, of his own motion, do what is proper.  I

have in no instance, over my own signature, made any denial

of charges based on my action as President. I prefer not to do

so.

  I rejoice that you are where you are and that you have the

wide and good fame that you more than deserve.

                           Sincerely,

                                               R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.

                        FREMONT, OHIO, December 26, 1885.

  DEAR SIR:--Your esteemed favor of the 17th is before me.

  1. The whiskey frauds of 1875 and 1876 you will find fully

considered, if I recollect correctly, in the debates in the Con-

gressional Record for those years and in. the Congressional in-

vestigations, and in the annual reports of the Secretary of the

Treasury, Mr. Bristow, for the same period.

  2. As to the statement of three thousand pardons of whiskey

convicts in 1877-1881, you will find no "data" to that effect.

Please inform me where you saw the statement. If practicable

send it to me.  Of course you know that the total number of

convicts of all sorts pardoned did not approximate the number

you mention.

  You are quite right in seeking exact information from of-

ficial sources. A good cause often suffers by the reckless and

baseless statements of its injudicious and excitable friends. If

you put faith in such tales as the one you refer to, your book

will have little value. Look to your facts.

                          Sincerely,           R. B. HAYES.



  P. S.- Don't fail to give me the authority for the three-

thousand story. The bane of our time, so far as written argu-

ment goes, is not the facts and logic of our adversaries - they

have none -but the hasty and careless statements of the friends

of the good cause.  Reform this- reform it altogether. - H.

  REV. J. M. MONROE,

    Belleair.



  December 30. Wednesday. - Our wedding day. Thirty-three

years ago we married. The wedding guests were not numerous

- perhaps thirty-five or forty including relatives. I recall of

those present the following who have passed away: Mother

Maria Webb and Lucy's brothers, Dr. Joseph T. and Dr. James

D., her uncle Isaac Cook, her aunt Lucy Cook, her cousin and

adopted brother, Wm. T. Scott, my Uncle Birchard, Sister Fanny,

her husband, Wm. A. Platt, and among the guests not relations

who have died are almost all of the old people,- old Mr. Sam-

uel Williams, formerly of Chillicothe, and his wife called by

Lucy Uncle and Aunty; the old people in whose house we lived,









             <B>WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 1885          259</B>



George and Abigail Warren, also called by Lucy Uncle George

and Aunty Warren. Among my own intimate friends of nearly

my own age, Richard C. Anderson (dear Dick!), George W.

Jones, and R. H. Stephenson were present and are now gone.

General Buckland happening to be in town was, of course, in-

vited to the wedding as one of my early friends. He still lives,

now an old man in feeble health. John W. Herron, one of my

closest friends of Cincinnati, and our valued friend[s] Dr.

John and Mrs. Davis were present and [are] still living. Laura

Platt, our darling niece, who stood up with us--happy and

proud to take part in the ceremony, then a girl of ten years old,

now lives, the fortunate mother of a fine boy John G. Mitchell

Jr., and three fine girls- one a lovely young lady! All the

relatives present except Laura have left us! And of the near

friends only Buckland, the Davis[es], and Herron remain!

  All of the family were at home Christmas, and remained

until the wedding day. A fine crowd -glad to think of all of

them--Birchard, Webb, Rutherford, Scott, and Fanny, the

darling !

  January 1, 1886.  New Years Day. - A beautiful spring day.

Called on Mr. Andrews. He is seriously sick with pneumonia.

        Called next on Theodore Clapp.  He is afflicted dread-

fully with rheumatism. Is called a spiritualist. Is not a be-

liever in orthodoxy. Takes cheerful and sensible views of the

course of things in the world.  Is very well informed -reads a

great deal and is on the whole one of the most agreeable of my

neighborhoods [neighbors].  Hands and feet so crippled that he

can scarcely get out of the house.  He sits at his window and

reads. He occasionally drives out with a quiet pair of old In-

dian ponies.  He meets poverty and disability uncomplainingly

with a spirit which in a church member we would call that of

an exemplary Christian. His wife, afflicted with cataract--al-

most blind, - is another meek and sweet-tempered person - like

her husband a Christian in the best sense, and yet both are re-

garded as infidels! They are never seen in church, but have all

the virtues except the devotional, which the church seeks to in-

culcate and extol.









<B>260          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Next on General Buckland, my early partner in the practice

of law. He is now seventy-four with some chronic trouble, but

the old hero stands up against it, and his sore affliction by reason

of his wife's mental infirmity, with the patience and fortitude

of a Roman. His pride is in his record as a soldier. At Shiloh

he commanded one of Sherman's brigades. All in line before the

enemy attacked, he held his place and did as much as any man to

save us from ruin on that day of fate. He was absent at his

office, where he daily attends to business in spite of age, disease,

and affliction! In the afternoon he returned my call with Dr.

Wilson.

  In the afternoon I visited -the first time in many months -

Uncle's old and dear friends Aunty Grant and Sarah. A chatty

time. Mr. and Mrs. VanDoren came in. His talk was of the

gas wells ....

  I called on Dr. Rawson (aged eighty-one, last September) and

found him with his mind clear and judgment prompt and sound.

He doubts gas wells as a general thing. But in Findlay he says

they always had an offensive smell in some localities and for

years have known and used natural gas to a limited extent.

  Called on Mrs. Thompson and Harriet with whom I boarded

forty years ago. Both crippled with rheumatism, but cheerful,

happy, and cordial.

  January 3.  Sunday.-A  good sermon to a small congrega-

tion.  Read Pope in the Century on Second Bull Run.  The cu-

rious paragraph at the close of the article is a remarkable in-

stance of how a falsehood, believed to be characteristic, has a

charmed life and sticks. The belief that Pope issued an order

containing the idea that his "headquarters were to be in saddle"

is almost universal even among his friends. It turns out that

this is a fabrication.  The strong point of the article against

Fitz-John Porter is that he, Porter, remained in column resting

near a battle without moving towards it-without making a

recognisance [reconnaissance] to his front, and that in fact he at

one time intended to move to the rear when the firing indicated

that our troops were being hardly Dressed.









             <B>MRS. HAYES'S BENEVOLENCE          261</B>



  January 21.  Thursday. - Lucy is very busy this morning in

her good-hearted work for the needy. A poor family, Mrs. Hart-

zell and [with] six small children, from twelve down to the

babe, wants to get back to her parents at or near Easton, Penn-

sylvania. Lucy pays the expenses "home again," and for a week

or two has been sewing and buying to get them ready. She

will feel a load of care is off from her hands when this is done.

She mentioned to me that they had some kindred here in fairly

good circumstances. I said why don't "the kin" help them. She

replied with one of her "chunks of wisdom":  "Two things I

have learned.   One is, if you want help, go to strangers in

preference to kin.  The other is, go to men of the world in

preference to professors, if you would have help or even justice.

This of course is liable to many exceptions, but I speak of the

common fact."

  January 22.  Friday.--How  to distribute more equally the

property of our country is a question we [Theodore Clapp and I]

considered yesterday.  We ought not to allow a permanent aris-

tocracy of inherited wealth to grow up in our country. How

would it answer to limit the amount that could be left to any

one person by will or otherwise? What should be the limit?

Let no one receive from another more than the law gives to the

Chief Justice, to the General of the Army, or to the President

of the Senate. Let the income of the property transmitted equal

this, say ten thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars. If

after distributing on this principle there remains undistributed

part of the estate, let it go to the public. The object is to se-

cure a distribution of great estates to prevent accumulat[ion].

  January 23.  Saturday. - Correspondence. - The political sit-

uation at Columbus and Washington read up very thoroughly. I

have not read the papers at all for two weeks. Gathered the news

in scraps from friends.  Senator Morrill's silver speech is sound.

  January 24.  Sunday. - The question for the country now is

how to secure a more equal distribution of property among the

people. There can be no republican institutions with vast masses

of property permanently in a few hands, and large masses of









<B>262          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



voters without property. To begin the work as a first step, pre-

vent large estates from passing by wills, or by inheritance, or by

corporations into the hands of a single man. Let no man get

by inheritance, or by will, more than will produce at four per

cent interest an income equal to the salary paid to the Chief Jus-

tice, to the General of the Army, or to the highest officer of the

Navy - say an income of fifteen thousand per year, or an estate

of five hundred thousand dollars.





                                 SPIEGEL, January 24, 1886.

  MY DARLING: - YOU shall have more letters. I will not neg-

lect you.

  As to your studies, I agree with you. There are too many of

them. The only question is which to drop. My decided pref-

erence is that you drop either Grecian history, physics, or astron-

omy. You will have another year at Farmington, I hope. I

don't know what "harmony" means. You may drop that if you

prefer. Music, you know, is the pet of both your mother and

father. But if you can't manage it, why, do as you suggest. You

are "wisest, discreetest, best." Who said that? Of whom was

it said?

  All the boys are now here. The weather is charming. We

only need you with your "Oho!" to be one of the happiest fami-

lies on the continent.

                     With all love, ever,

                                    RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Farmington.



          SPIEGEL GROVE, FREMONT, OHIO, January 24, 1886.

  MY DEAR GUY: - I was very much touched by your welcome

letter. We are indeed marching rapidly on to the inevitable close.

An acquaintance and intimate friendship that dates back almost

half a century is something to think of with growing interest.

The letter of Albert Pike struck me as it did you. I was so

pleased with it that I had it copied as you see. Cicero "On Old









             <B>DE SENECTUTE COMMENDED          263</B>



Age" is worth reading now.  It is better than it was when we

had it as a task at school. Try it some day. I now read it in a

translation.

  Dear Guy! He entirely won all our hearts. Give him our love.

All of our children were with us Christmas and on the thirty-

third anniversary of our wedding day! Fanny is at school in

Farmington, Connecticut. Scott in an industrial school in To-

ledo. We are all in the best of health.

  You have hit the nail on the head. The ex-Presidential situa-

tion has its advantages, but with them are certain drawbacks. The

correspondence is large.  The meritorious demands on one are

large. More independent out than in place, but still something

of the bondage of the place that was willingly left. On the whole,

however, I find many reasons to be content.

  I hope we can meet next summer. My home is a good place

to meet. You will be the welcome guest here always. By the by,

we missed Laura Ballinger by not knowing she was so near to

us until it was too late. Always count on us - all of us. Mrs.

Hayes joins in all regards.

                           As ever,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

    Texas.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, January 24, 1886.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have the Record for the first session of the

Forty-eighth Congress, but nothing since the parts of the fifteenth

volume. Will be glad to have the rest.

  Nobody felt happier over the occasion of your late election

than I did. It is a signal triumph for you. With what genuine

pleasure you are entitled to regard your long public life! Your

friends and the country think of your career just as you would

wish them to.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

    Washington, D. C.

  MY DARLING: -Your mother and Adda go to Cincinnati for

some indefinite time tomorrow.

  Do not disobey any rules of the school. It would have mor-

tified me if you had gone into the double ripper "biz." Do be

trusty and reliably obedient. Of course, if you do go wrong,

you will not run or hide or prevaricate. Excuse so much lec-

ture !

  We shall have a quiet house -lonely and doleful with Lucy

and Adda both gone. Write often.

                        Affectionately,

                                     RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES.



  February 2.  Tuesday. - The twenty-first year since the war

of the Rebellion is drawing to its close. In no year since the final

victory of the Union arms has there been a deeper or keener in-

terest in the events and scenes and characters of the great conflict

than we have seen in the year that is now rapidly passing. The

last book is the best. It has the largest sale, it is read with the

profoundest interest and the liveliest relish. The periodical that

has the most and best war articles is the periodical that wins.

Our matchless comrade and companion, our illustrious com-

mander going to his grave in the simple garb of a citizen - wear-

ing no mark of rank -nothing to tell of his achievements as a

soldier except the simple badges of the G. A. R. and the Loyal

Legion, though dead to sight, speaks today to more minds, with

a higher authority, and gets back a readier and heartier reply

than ever before.

  Two things we observe and rejoice to observe touching the

literature of the war that has appeared during the last year.

One is the intense and penetrating interest that is taken in it to

which I have already alluded, and the other is the charitable and

magnanimous spirit which penetrates what is written. The war

gave rise to rivalries, bitterness, to harsh and cruel criticisms

among officers and men under the same flag. Regiments were

embittered against each other in the same brigade. Brigades,









             <B>INTEREST IN WAR LITERATURE          265</B>



divisions, and army corps were divided and hostile. This feeling

soon almost disappeared. But the rivalries and contentions of

officers lasted longer. Grant, Pope, Wallace, and others show

a different spirit now.



                                   SPIEGEL, February 2, 1886.

  MY DARLING: - I was made very happy last night by a letter

from Miss Porter in which she speaks so beautifully, so discrim-

inatingly, so justly about my daughter that I could not refrain

from telling you.  Yes, glad to have such a young person an-

other year,- "tourse" is the substance of it. So you have a

high place, and will keep it.

  Lucy and Adda are still unheard from. No doubt I will

[shall] get a letter today. I now expect them to stay until I

come a week from today.

  This is woodchuck day. The tradition or superstition has va-

rious renderings. The common one is, if the woodchuck comes

out and sees his shadow, he will, with a shudder and chill, run

back into his hole, knowing that there will be six weeks more of

winter. If he can see no shadow he understands that winter is

about done with and he prepares for his spring work. Now, to-

day it is bright and clear. Woodchuck will see a distinct shadow.

So look out for more blizzards!- Write often.

                           Lovingly,

                                      RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Farmington.



  February 13. Cincinnati. - At the pleasant home of John W.

and Harriet C. Herron, our dear friends, lo ! these so many years

-about thirty-five or thirty-six years. Their charming family

were never more charming. Jack is a fine, strong, promising

boy- full of friendly affection! The young ladies are superior

persons; the two smaller girls fill a tender place in the household.

Little Lucy Hayes Herron is bewitching- a little angel.

  The Loyal Legion banquet passed off successfully. Mr. Perry

says my talk was perfect-good words from high authority.









<B>266          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



When I was told by General Force that it had been said, I

promptly replied: "Mr. Perry (A. F.) could surpass it himself."

  General Sherman was much affected when I spoke of Hancock.

Tears ran down his cheeks.

  Banquets with courses in fashionable style should be given

up. We should in place of them have a lunch or collation, with

the food on the tables and brought in as required. We would

save one or two hours of time, would have room enough for all

of the ladies- and at a less cost!

  We should have not more than three regular toasts and set

speeches and after that short offhand talks, and so adjourn by

twelve, midnight.

  These reforms I am urging.  We -the Loyal Legion-are

now in a condition to set examples, to lead the fashion, to

start reforms. Let us do it, and so do good service in the society

world.





                            CINCINNATI, February 13, 1886.

  MY DARLING:-We never made a more enjoyable visit than

this one turns out to be. The Loyal Legion affair was capital.

Adda, Mrs. Herron, and your mother enjoyed it to the full.

General Sherman was charming. The ladies' reception passed off

successfully. I send you a newspaper containing the account of

it. You will not read the voluminous details, but as a dutiful

daughter you will read about your mother's part in it, and your

father's speech.

  We go to Delaware Monday. We tea with General Force to-

night, and tomorrow (Sunday) we dine out at Larz Anderson's.

  We also hope to hear the incomparable "Sam Jones," who is

doing a world of good work.

  I could not go to the funeral of General Hancock as pub-

lished.

               We all love you. Affectionately,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MISS FANNY HAYES,

    Farmington.









             <B>JONES AND SMALL EVANGELISTS          267</B>



  February 17.  Wednesday.- Reached home on the Wheeling

last evening via Delaware, Columbus, etc., etc. Left Lucy in

Cincinnati at our dear friends', the Herrons'. A most charm-

ing visit. . . .

  The evangelists Jones and Small have just finished a revival

work of a month [at Cincinnati]. Leave out criticisms on trifling

peculiarities of opinion and style, and their work is admirable.

They have drawn audiences, many thousand each, daily and

nightly. This shows unusual powers. Jones is quiet and conver-

sational in manner, is witty and pathetic, talks wholesome sense,

hits the prevailing vices skilfully; is earnest, and full of love in

charity for his fellow men. With all of these attractions he

delights his hearers. But all this without his topic would not

draw.  Men do want to know about the future life, to believe

in it, to secure it. They do want a higher and surer happiness

and rest than they find here, and they naturally crowd around a

man who can tell them about these things in a way that assures

them that he at least believes in it. Men and women do love to

contemplate characters and beings superior to themselves. They

do want to worship.

  February 19. Friday.- Called in the evening at the Ball

House on Judge L. B. Otis, of Chicago. He was a lawyer here

forty years ago. Afterwards a banker in partnership with Uncle

Birchard. He went to Chicago with perhaps forty thousand dol-

lars, thirty years ago. His purpose was to make a fortune. He

succeeded. He is a millionaire. He is happy in his good fortune.

Wise in money making. He believes in corner lots in the centre

of the business part of a city. He and his family - counting

three brothers and sons- own ten corner lots with large blocks

on them.- The night is stormy, but two hours of Otis' worldly-

wise talk made it pass quickly. He has Shakespeare's idea. A

man must take his time. All men have their opportunity. But

only once.  That missed and      .  "There is a tide in the affairs

of men," etc.
