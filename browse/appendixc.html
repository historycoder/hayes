 Early in 1898 the trustees of the Ohio State Archaeological and

Historical Society, of which Rutherford B. Hayes was president at

the time of his death, learned that the Hayes family, in memory of

their parents, were ready to give Spiegel Grove with its in-

valuable collection of historical papers and books to the society,

provided a fund were created the income of which should in-

sure its perpetual preservation and care. Thereupon the society

sent out the following "confidential circular":

The Trustees of the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical

Society, having learned that it might be possible for it to obtain

the title to and possession of the property known as "Spiegel

Grove," the home of the late President Rutherford B. Hayes,

conferred with the family concerning this purpose.  In the effort

to secure this property it is believed the society will meet with

hearty endorsement from the numerous friends of President

Hayes, who have expressed their desire to see this property pre-

srved as a memorial to one of the noblest and greatest of Ohio's

citizens. In this project the society is most deeply interested,

not only because its object is the promotion and preservation of

all that is of historic value to our State, but more particularly in

this instance, because President Hayes was one of the originators

of the society, for many years one of its most ardent friends and

supporters, and at the time of his death, January 17, 1893, its

honored president. The officers of the society finally obtained

from the family the proposition published with this circular. This

offer of the family is unusual for its liberality and most worthy

of commendation for the filial desire it expresses to perpetuate

this memorial to loved and honored parents.

             <B>OFFER OF SPIEGEL GROVE TO STATE          271</B>



  This proposition of the family of President Hayes, the trus-

tees of the society would most willingly accept, and the society

through its officers is prepared to make every possible endeavor

to bring about a consummation of the plan proposed.

  It should be clearly understood in this proposition, that the

family receive no compensation for the property specified, but

deed it to the society upon the condition, viz: That twenty-five

thousand dollars be raised and permanently invested as a fund, the

income of which will insure the proper care and preservation of

this property under the custodianship of the society.

  It is proper to state that the Ohio Historical Society was in-

corporated March 13, 1885, and the Hon. Allen G. Thurman was

its first president; it is the official historical society of the State,

six of its trustees being appointed by the governor. For years

the society has been the custodian of Ft. Ancient, the largest and

best preserved and most interesting remains of the Mound Build-

ers now extant. The Historical Society is therefore not only

the proper organization to carry out the plan above outlined, but

indeed is, perhaps, the only instrumentality through which this

praiseworthy purpose may be accomplished.

  The place known as Spiegel Grove is of great historical interest,

being located ill the old Indian Reservation or Free Territory

maintained by the Indian tribes at the Lower Rapids of the

Sandusky River for a long period prior to the Revolutionary

War.   Near the centre of the reservation, Ft. Stephenson was

built just prior to the War of 1812 and became famous by

reason of its gallant defense by Major George Croghan against

the combined assaults of the land and naval forces of Great

Britain under Procter and Indians under Tecumseh on the 1st

and 2nd of August, 1813. The old Harrison Trail, so-called, a

military road leading from Ft. Stephenson to Ft. Seneca, and

then south, passes through the grove and is preserved as the

principal driveway.

  Of all the homes of our twenty-four Presidents, covering a

period of one hundred and ten years, the only ones that have

been preserved are those of Washington, at Mt. Vernon; Jeffer-

son, at Monticello; Madison, at Montpelier; Jackson, at the Her-

mitage, and Lincoln's modest home in the city of Springfield.









<B>272          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



All of these are now in the hands of private societies, although

in some instances assistance has been had from their respective

States. But in every case mentioned, more or less time has

elapsed before the homes were secured and put in a state of

preservation, and few or no personal relics or memorials were

secured. Spiegel Grove is now in a perfect state of preservation,

and all of the valuable historical effects of President Hayes re-

main there intact. Unquestionably this is the largest and most

complete and perhaps most valuable collection of documents,

papers, and books, ever left by any of our Presidents. President

Hayes was a great reader and a man of scholarly tastes and at-

tainments. He acquired the finest library of American history

perhaps owned by any private individual, and during his public

life he preserved all papers and memoranda in an orderly and

accessible form. All of this material will be at the service of

students and scholars if this plan of the society can be carried

out. It is certainly a rare opportunity, such as seldom comes to

any State or organization. The citizens of Ohio, the friends of

President Hayes, and the students of American history cannot

afford to do otherwise than endorse and assist in this project of

the society and the family of President Hayes.

             President.



      PROPOSITION OF THE FAMILY OF PRESIDENT HAYES

                             CLEVELAND, OHIO, April 2, 1898.

To  General R. Brinkerhoff, President Ohio Archaeological and

      Historical Society:

  DEAR SIR:--Our father, Rutherford B. Hayes, by the second

clause of his will, devised his home, known as Spiegel Grove, in

the following language:

  "I give and bequeath the home place known as Spiegel Grove,

and all the personal property connected therewith, to Birchard

A., Webb C., Rutherford P., Fanny, and Scott R. Hayes, to be

by them held in common, without sale or division, but in case of









             <B>OFFER OF SPIEGEL GROVE TO STATE          273</B>



sale or division the same to belong equally to my said children

or their heirs."

  Ever since our father's death, we have cared for Spiegel Grove

and occupied it at least during the summer months as a family

homestead. It is difficult to estimate the actual value of the

Spiegel Grove property. Suffice it to say that, for purposes for

which we do not wish to dispose of it, we have been offered a

considerable sum. We have long cherished the idea that we

would like in some way to make this place a memorial to our

father and mother, and we have been gathering articles of his-

torical interest and storing them at Spiegel Grove or placing

them for safe keeping in the Birchard Library at Fremont, which

our father founded in memory of his uncle.  If Spiegel Grove is

to be a memorial as we wish, we desire to have it placed in such

control that it will always be properly cared for and be a place

in which every one interested in such matters, and especially in

this memorial, can take pride.  We desire, therefore, to make the

following proposition through you to your society:

  If the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, or some of

its members, will procure a fund of at least twenty-five thousand

($25,000.00) dollars to be set aside and managed in such a way

that the principal shall not be encroached upon, but the income

from it be devoted to preserving and caring for the Spiegel

Grove property, our sister and ourselves will undertake to con-

vey to your society, or an organization which we shall agree

upon, all of said Spiegel Grove property located within the city

limits of Fremont, Ohio, and containing about twenty-five acres,

together with the personal relics, curios, paintings, and property

now in the home place in Spiegel Grove, excepting therefrom

the library Americana.     All of the personal property above

mentioned to be kept perpetually on the Spiegel Grove premises.

  If a suitable fire-proof building should be erected upon the

property at some time in the future, we would hope to make

such arrangements with your society that it would become pos-

sessed of the library Americana, and would add to it the curios

and relics now loaned to the Birchard Library, and such other

historical relics as we might secure from time to time.

  We would desire upon our part that so long as any of us

   18









<B>274          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



live, that we could at such times as we saw fit, have the privi-

lege of occupying with our families the house, or a portion of it,

now in Spiegel Grove.

  We have thought it might be advisable to form a new corpora-

tion kindred to or affiliated with your society which should have

the immediate charge of Spiegel Grove.        The trustees of the

new corporation to be named or designated by your society, and

we to be upon the board so long as we should care to be.

                       Very respectfully,

                                      BIRCHARD A. HAYES,

                                      WEBB C. HAYES,

                                      RUTHERFORD P. HAYES,

                                      SCOTT R. HAYES.



  Letters approving the proposition follow:

          EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, April 25, 1898.

  MY DEAR SIR: - My attention has recently been called to the

possibility of the trustees of your society obtaining ownership

of the property known as "Spiegel Grove," the home of the late

President Hayes.

  The offer made by the family is one which will appeal to the

public spirit of the citizens of Ohio.  So historic an estate, with

its wealth of associations and interest, and an exceedingly im-

portant collection of books and  documents,  should  be saved

to the State of Ohio and placed within the reach of all to whom

their use will be of great value and inspiration.

  For these reasons it is a pleasure to me to lend my encourage-

ment to this laudable undertaking.

                     Very sincerely yours,

                                       WILLIAM McKINLEY.



       DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, April 22, 1898.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have read with interest the very liberal offer

of the family of the late President Hayes of their father's home-

stead known  as "Spiegel Grove," together with the many his-

torically valuable books, papers, and curios which he gathered









             <B>FIRST DEED OF GIFT TO STATE          275</B>



together during his lifetime. The collection is a most valuable

one and the control of it by our Ohio Historical Society is cer-

tainly very desirable. There are but four or five "homes of the

Presidents" preserved at the present time, and I trust there will be

no difficulty in raising the endowment fund so that "Spiegel

Grove" may be secured by your society.

                      Very truly yours,

                                           JOHN SHERMAN.

  GENERAL R. BRINKERHOFF,

    PRESIDENT OHIO ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY,

      Columbus, Ohio.



  The society, however, did not succeed in raising the required

endowment, and the entire Spiegel Grove estate, library, and

collections, became in 1899 the property of Colonel Webb C.

Hayes, by deed from the other heirs for money advanced to the

estate.  In order to insure the permanent preservation of the por-

tion of the ancient Indian trail from Lake Erie to the Ohio

River running through the grove, Colonel Hayes in March, 1909,

deeded some ten acres of Spiegel Grove to the Stateof Ohio. A

copy of the deed of gift follows:

THIRD OR TRUST DEED BY WEBB C. HAYES, TO IN-

   SURE THE EVENTUAL TRANSFER OF SPIEGEL

     GROVE, AS A MEMORIAL TO HIS PARENTS.

  KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, That I, Webb C. Hayes,

single, the grantor, in consideration of one dollar ($1.00) and

other good and valuable considerations to me in hand paid by

Webb C. Hayes, Fanny Hayes Smith, and Birchard A. Hayes,

Trustees, the Grantees, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,

do hereby remise, release and forever convey to the grantees,

their successors and assigns forever the following described real

estate in Spiegel Grove:--

  SITUATED in the City of Fremont, County of Sandusky, State of

Ohio, and comprising all of that part of outlot No. 117 known as

Spiegel Grove, except those parts thereof heretofore conveyed by

the said grantor to the State of Ohio for a state park, which

excepted parcels are more particularly described in two (2) cer-

tain deeds, duly recorded in the Records of Deeds in Sandusky

County, Ohio. The premises hereby intended to be conveyed

comprise about five (5) acres of land, more or less, but subject

  To HAVE AND TO HOLD the above described premises with all

the appurtenances hereunto belonging unto the said grantees,

their successors and assigns forever, subject, however, to the

trusts and consideration, hereinafter in this deed expressed.

  Ever since the death of Rutherford B. Hayes and Lucy Webb

Hayes, it has been the desire of their children to place Spiegel

Grove, which for many years was their home into such hands and

under such conditions as would make it a fitting memorial from

their children to a beloved father and mother. In partial accom-

plishment of this desire the said grantor has heretofore conveyed

to the State of Ohio portions of the aforesaid Spiegel Grove,

which portions so conveyed are to be held by the State of Ohio









<B>282          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



for the use and benefit of the Ohio State Archeological and His-

torical Society so long as the premises shall be maintained as a

state park in which the old French and Indian Trail along the

Sandusky water course from Lake Erie to the Ohio River, later

known as the "Harrison Military Trail of the War  of 1812,"

shall be preserved in its location and maintained as a park drive

together with the park drives in the above described premises sub-

stantially as now located, and in which the trees, shrubs, and

flowers now growing in said park and Spiegel Grove shall be pre-

served and cared for, and together with other trees, shrubs, and

flowers as may be hereafter planted in said park and Spiegel

Grove shall be properly marked with their scientific and common

names so as to be instructive and interesting to visitors. In order

to completely carry out the intentions of said grantor so that ul-

timately all of Spiegel Grove may be held and used for the pur-

poses aforesaid, and the residence therein preserved in its original

condition as a typical American home of the last half of the nine-

teenth century and used for residential purposes only, the said

grantor has executed and delivered this conveyance to the afore-

said grantees and it is his intention to so vest title in the aforesaid

grantees so as to fully authorize and empower the said grantees,

their successors and assigns to convey the aforesaid premises to

the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society, or to the

State of Ohio as trustee for the aforesaid society, but in the

conveyance of said premises to the said society or to the State

of Ohio as trustee for said society, there shall be inserted in sub-

stance the following covenants and conditions:-

   First: That the said the Ohio State Archaeological and His-

torical Society shall secure the erection upon that part of Spiegel

Grove heretofore conveyed to the State of Ohio for a state park

a suitable fire-proof building on the site reserved opposite the Jef-

ferson Street entrance for the purpose of preserving and forever

keeping in Spiegel Grove all papers, books, and manuscripts left

by the said Rutherford B. Hayes, together with such articles and

property belonging to the said Rutherford B. Hayes as are now

loaned or stored with the Birchard Library Association or else-

where in Fremont, Ohio, including also such articles and property

of the grantor as may have been loaned or stored by the said

grantor with the Western Reserve Historical Society of Cleve-

land, Ohio, or the Birchard Library Association of Fremont,

Ohio, which building shall be in the form of a branch reference

library and museum of the Ohio State Archaeological and His-

torical Society, and the construction and decoration of the said

building shall be in the nature of a memorial also to the soldiers,

sailors, and pioneers of Sandusky County; and suitable memorial

tablets, busts, and decorations indicative of the historical events

and patriotic citizenship of Sandusky County shall be placed in

and on said building, and said building shall forever remain open

to the public under proper rules and regulations to be hereafter

made by said society.

  Second: Any conveyance of the described premises shall re-

serve to the said grantor during his lifetime and to his nominee,

appointed as hereinafter provided and to the remaining grantees

and to their nominees and to the successors of said nominees as

hereinafter appointed after said grantor's death the right of oc-

cupying the residence now located upon the premises hereinbefore

described at such times as he or they see fit to occupy same. Upon

the death of Birchard A. Hayes, his son, Webb C. Hayes II, shall

have the right of occupancy of said premises in place of said

Birchard A. Hayes, and the further right shall be given Webb C.

Hayes II to nominate in writing a person to succeed him in such

right of occupancy and such right of nomination shall descend to

any subsequent occupant of said residence nominated by the said

Webb C. Hayes II, or any succeeding nominee, provided, however,

that if the said Webb C. Hayes I  shall die before the death of the

said Birchard A. Hayes, said Birchard A. Hayes shall have the

right of nomination and such right shall succeed to future nomi-

nees in the same way as if the original nomination had been made

by the said Webb C. Hayes II.

  Upon the death of Fanny Hayes Smith, her son Dalton, shall

have the right of occupancy of said premises in place of the said

Fanny Hayes Smith, and the further right shall be given to said

Dalton to nominate in writing a person to succeed him in such

right of occupancy and such right of nomination shall descend to

any subsequent occupant of said residence nominated by the said

Dalton or any succeeding nominee, provided, however, that if the









<B>284          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



said Dalton shall die before the death of said Fanny Hayes Smith,

said Fanny Hayes Smith shall have the right of nomination and

such right shall succeed to future nominees in the same way as if

the original nomination had been made by the said Dalton.

   The said grantee, Webb C. Hayes, shall have the right to nom-

inate in writing a person to succeed him in the occupancy of said

residence and such right of nomination shall descend to any sub-

sequent occupant of said residence nominated by the said Webb

C. Hayes, or any succeeding nominee. The nominee of said Webb

C. Hayes shall have the right of exclusive occupancy of said resi-

dence after his death, or occupancy in common with others as may

be designated in the instrument appointing such nominee, and if

exclusive occupancy is given by said instrument such occupancy

shall be prior to that of any other person.

  No person except a husband or a wife of the above named gran-

tees shall be nominated or given the right of occupying said resi-

dence in the manner aforesaid unless he or she shall be a lineal de-

scendant of the said Rutherford B. Hayes and Lucy Webb Hayes.

  If at any time there shall be no one living selected in the manner

aforesaid to occupy said residence, then the trustees of the Ohio

State Archaeological and Historical Society shall have the right to

select a lineal descendant of said Rutherford B. Hayes and Lucy

Webb Hayes to use and occupy said residence; but said residence

shall never be occupied or used for any other than residential pur-

poses only, to the end of preserving it in its original condition as a

typical American home of the last half of the nineteenth century.

  The foregoing matter contained in this second paragraph shall

not preclude the occupancy of a suitable portion of said residence

by a caretaker during the absence of those who by the terms of

this paragraph are given the right of occupancy in said home.

  If, however, the said Ohio State Archaeological and Historical

Society shall not consent to receive the conveyance of the above

described premises substantially in the terms hereinbefore set

forth and shall not provide for the erection of the said fire-proof

building within a period of three (3) years, from the date of this

instrument, then full right, power and authority are hereby given

to the said grantees, their successors and assigns to convey the

aforesaid premises to such other society or organization as in









             <B>THIRD OR TRUST DEED          285</B>



the judgment of said grantees, their successors or assigns, will

carry out the object and purpose of making the aforesaid prem-

ises a memorial to the said Rutherford B. Hayes and Lucy Webb

Hayes upon substantially the terms and conditions hereinbefore

in this instrument expressed.

  In the event of the death of any of the above named grantees

before the accomplishment of the trust purposes in this deed set

forth, then the person who by the terms of this deed would have

the right of occupancy of said premises as successor to the one

so becoming deceased shall also succeed such deceased one as

trustee under the terms of this deed and shall be vested with all

rights, powers, and duties which have heretofore been conferred

upon the one so becoming deceased. It is the intention of the

grantor herein that the persons entitled to the occupancy of said

residence and the trustees hereunder shall be the same persons.

  Until the conveyance of the above described premises shall have

been made by the said grantees, the said grantor reserves to him-

self and, after his death, reserves to the remaining grantees, the

right of occupancy of the above described premises and upon the

death of any of said grantees, the right of succession to the occu-

pancy of said premises shall devolve upon the persons and in the

manner heretofore indicated.

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand this 12th

day of March, A. D. 1910.

                       STATE OF OHIO,

             OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

                                    COLUMBUS, May 21, 1920.

  DEAR SIR: - In your communication of November 21, 1919,

you indicate that your Society is desirous of having recorded a

certain deed executed by Col. Webb C. Hayes, March 12, 1910,

conveying to certain trustees named therein a part of Spiegel

Grove (about 5 acres) together with certain personal belongings

of Rutherford B. Hayes, said property to be conveyed by said

trustees to the State for the benefit of your Society upon the hap-

pening of certain contingencies, and another deed executed by the









             <B>FOURTH DEED GIVING ALL TO STATE          291</B>



said trustees November 27, 1914, conveying said properties to the

State of Ohio in pursuance to the provisions of said deed of trust.

  A rather extensive investigation has been made of the various

transactions in connection with the Spiegel Grove matter and it

appears that the Legislature of Ohio in the general appropriation

bill passed May 31, 1911, (102 O. L., page 375) and other acts

since said date, accepted the provisions of the deed of trust here-

tofore referred to, as well as two former recorded deeds convey-

ing a part of Spiegel Grove which were approved in form by At-

torney General Denman.

  The abstract for the entire Spiegel Grove tract having been

approved by Attorney General Hogan and he having advised your

Society to follow the provisions of said deed of trust (see Opinion

of Attorney General No. 446, 1912) and as above stated the Leg-

islature having accepted the provisions of the deed of trust, the

only thing required to be done at this time is to deliver said deeds

to the Recorder of Sandusky County for record, after which they

should be left for record with the Auditor of State.

  Of course, the only action that the Attorney General is author-

ized to take in this matter at this time is to approve the form of

the said deed executed to the State November 27, 1914, which

approval has been endorsed thereon.

  Enclosed herewith you will find the two deeds above referred to

and the abstract.      Very respectfully,

                                         JOHN G. PRICE,

                                       ATTORNEY GENERAL

  HON. JAMES E. CAMPBELL,

    PRESIDENT OHIO ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY,

      Columbus, Ohio.

party," Witnesseth:

  That said first party [Webb C. Hayes] has simultaneously with

the execution of this agreement deposited with said third party

[the Union  Trust  Company]  the securities and property  de-

scribed in Schedule A  hereto attached, and made a part hereof,

and  which  deposit,  and  the  investments  and  reinvestments

thereof, are hereinafter in this agreement denominated the trust

estate, and are to be held, treated and disposed of as hereinafter

in this agreement set forth.

  Said  third  party  [the  Union  Trust  Company]  shall have

custody and control of the trust estate and shall invest and rein-

vest the same in the manner following:

  (a)  It may loan all or any part of said trust estate in loans

secured by mortgage upon improved real estate located in Cuyahoga

County, Ohio, which real estate shall have an appraised value as

fixed by the regular appraisers  employed by  said third party

[the Union Trust Company] of not less than double the amount

so loaned.

  (b)  It may invest and reinvest said trust estate in such man-

ner and form, other than in real estate loans, as to it shall seem

wise.  Provided, however, that no investment other than in real

estate loans, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, as aforesaid, shall be

made by said third party [the Union Trust Company],  unless

same shall have been submitted to and received the written ap-

proval of the finance committee of said second party [the Ohio

State Achaeological and Historical Society], which written ap-

proval shall be evidenced by a statement signed by the secretary

or such other  officer of  said  second party  [the Ohio  State

Archaeological and Historical Society] as said second party may

designate for that purpose, and provided further, that if first

party [Webb C. Hayes] is living, same shall also be submitted

to him and receive his written approval.

manuscripts, and other articles of historical value, especially those

relating to military events and to Ohio and the Northwest Terri-

building.

  If for any reason said Hayes Memorial Library and Museum

building shall not be properly cared for or kept in repair, then

in the sole discretition of said third party [the Union Trust Com-

pany] such net income or so much thereof as may be necessary

may be used by it for the care, support, and maintenance of said

building, but such permissive use of said net income for the care

and repair of said building  shall not be held or construed as

releasing the State of Ohio or any other person or corporation

who are now or who may hereafter be charged with the care

and maintenance of said building.  For any money so expended

by the third party [the Union Trust Company] for the care and

maintenance of said building, claim shall be made by the third

party [the Union Trust Company] against those charged with

the care and maintenance of said building and effort made by

it to enforce such claim.

Company (now the Union Trust Company, of Cleveland, Ohio),

second party:

  Paragraph Fifth: After the death of said first party [Webb

C. Hayes] and after the death of the said Mary Miller Hayes,

the net income derived from the trust fund shall be used and ap-

plied by said second party [the Union Trust Company] in the

manner following:

  (a) If no adequate provision has been made therefor, then

from the net income derived from said trust fund said second party

[the Union Trust Company] shall use so much as in its judg-

ment is necessary to pay the cost and expenses of the proper

care, preservation, maintenance and repair of the residence and

other buildings appurtenant thereto, in Spiegel Grove, Fremont,

Ohio, and the grounds adjajcent thereto, [being the same premises

as were conveyed by Webb C. Hayes et al. to the State of Ohio,

by deed dated November 27, 1914] formerly owned and occupied

by Rutherford B. Hayes, to the end that same may be preserved

in its present condition as a typical American home of the last

half of the nineteenth century. Such care, preservation, mainte-

nance and repair of said residence and other property shall include

among other things the maintenance of fire insurance to the

reasonable insurable value of said residence property and contents,

the restoration of any part of said residence property, including

decorations, furniture, fixtures, rugs, and other furnishings which

may become worn out, damaged, or destroyed, the necessary light,

fuel, and water to make said residence properly habitable at all

times, and such other matters and things as in the judgment of

said second party [the Union Trust Company] may be necessary

to carry out the terms of this paragraph (a).  Said second party

[the Union Trust Company] shall have sole charge and direction

as to the manner of expending said amounts for the purposes

aforesaid, provided that if any dispute arises as to whether or not

sufficient is being used for the purposes in this paragraph men-

tioned, then such dispute shall be submitted for decision to the

President of the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society

and his decision on same shall be final and binding.

  (b) After the care, preservation, maintenance and repair of









             <B>LIBRARY BOOK FUND TRUST          295</B>



the residence property in Spiegel Grove, Fremont, Ohio, as set

forth in paragraph (a) above, then the surplus income which

may remain shall be retained by said second party [the Union

Trust Company] and invested and reinvested in the same manner

as hereinbefore it has been provided for the investment of the

principal of said trust fund until such accumulation of net income

shall amount to the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), which

fund shall be designated as the "Reserve Fund," and if at any

time the net income derived from the trust fund created by this

agreement, together with the net income derived from said Re-

serve fund in this paragraph (b) mentioned, shall be insufficient

for the proper care, preservation, maintenance and repair of the

residence property in Spiegel Grove, Fremont, Ohio, as herein-

before provided in paragraph (a), then full right, power and

authority are hereby given said second party [the Union Trust

Company] to use all or any part of said Reserve Fund for the

accomplishment of these purposes, and in the event that any

part of said Reserve Fund shall be so used, then and thereafter

any net income remaining after providing for the purposes set

forth in paragraph (a) hereof shall be retained by said second

party [the Union Trust Company]  and added to the principal

of said Reserve Fund until said Reserve Fund shall be restored

to said sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). Any income

derived from said Reserve Fund in this paragraph (b) created

not needed for the purposes hereinbefore in this paragraph (b)

mentioned shall be used in the same manner as hereinafter in

paragraph (c) it is provided for the use of the income for the

benefit of the Hayes Memorial Library and Museum Fund.

Subject to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this item fifth,

said second party [the Union Trust Company] shall pay the

insurance premiums on the residence property in Spiegel Grove,

and if such residence property shall wholly or in part be injured

or destroyed, said second party [the Union Trust Company]

shall restore or rebuild it as nearly as possible in its present form,

so as to perpetuate, as hereinbefore planned, "a typical American

home of the last half of the nineteenth century," and the expense

of such restoration or rebuilding shall be paid from the insurance









<B>296          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



money, and if necessary, such portion or all of the Reserve Fund

created by this paragraph (b) as may be required.

  (c)  Any net income remaining  from said trust fund at the

end of each calendar year, not required for the purposes set forth

in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, shall be added to and become

a part of the income derived from  a certain trust fund, known

as the Hayes Memorial Library and Museum Fund, created by

agreement dated January 29, 1916, entered into between Webb

C. Hayes, the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society

and the Citizens Savings and Trust Company [now the Union

Trust Company], but when so added such additions shall be used

exclusively for the purpose of purchasing books of the same

       EXTENT OF COLONEL WEBB C. HAYES'S

                      BENEFACTION

  The tablet in commemoration of the soldiers of Sandusky

County who perished in the Nation's service, placed on the front

of the Hayes Memorial Building at Spiegel Grove, was unveiled

with fitting ceremonies October 4, 1920.  The Honorable James

E. Campbell, President of the Ohio State Archaeological and

Historical Society, presided on the occasion.    In the course of

his remarks, he paid the following tribute to Colonel Hayes's

filial generosity:-

  "I take it upon myself, as president of this society, to relate

publicly and in detail what Colonel Hayes has contributed to this

great patriotic monument, aside from the property itself; and

these facts are due historically, not only to Colonel Hayes, but to

the society and to the people of Ohio.

  "Colonel Hayes spent large sums after the legal steps had been

taken to vest this property in the Ohio Archaeological and

Historical Society, in trust for the State of Ohio. The con-

struction of the Hayes Memorial building cost when completed

over one hundred thousand dollars towards which the State paid

forty-five thousand dollars and also paid ten thousand dollars

for the State's share of the paving of the streets on the three

sides of the Spiegel Grove State Park. Colonel Hayes at various

times, and in numerous ways, in order to complete the building

and bring it to the point of perfection which it has attained, ex-

pended fifty thousand to that end, and to further add to its use-

fulness and beauty as a monument, he has provided for an addition

to the building that will cost at least thirty-five thousand dol-

lars [fifty thousand dollars] the funds for which are now in the

hands of a trustee appointed for that purpose.

  "Since Spiegel Grove has been dedicated by Colonel Hayes,

he has placed in the hands of trustees for the benefit of the so-

ciety and the State of Ohio other lands contiguous to the grove

which, when sold, the trustees are to place the proceeds thereof in

a trust fund for the use and benefit of this institution. So far

lands to the value of thirty-five thousand dollars [sixty thousand

dollars] have been disposed of, and that amount is in the hands

of a trustee for the use and benefit of Spiegel Grove, as held by

this society. The land, exclusive of Spiegel Grove, remaining

unsold is worth at least one hundred thousand dollars, the pro-

ceeds of which, upon sale, will be held in trust for the use and

maintenance of the Spiegel Grove park and residence with any

remainder for books for the Hayes Memorial Library.

  "On July I of last year Colonel Hayes placed one hundred

thousand in trust to be used in the maintenance and upbuilding

of this patriotic memorial. I am within a conservative estimate

when I state that Colonel Hayes has disposed, for the benefit of

posterity, in the form of the beautiful and attractive property

which you see before you, at least five hundred thousand dol-

lars: two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash and securi-

ties for endowment funds, and two hundred and fifty thousand

dollars in real estate and personal property including the library

Americana and collections."
