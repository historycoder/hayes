   Spiegel Grove, the beautiful twenty-five acre grove of native

American trees, is a portion of the historic site of the free city

of the neutral nation of the Eries, who three centuries ago built

two fortified towns on opposite sides of the Sandusky River.

The site of this free city, where later the Wyandots (or Hurons)

made a village, was on the great natural runway of the earliest

French explorers and missionaries and their Indian allies in

passing from the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes to the Ohio

and the Mississippi. This old French and Indian Trail was

along the westerly bank of the Sandusky-Scioto water course

from Lake Erie to the Ohio River.  Both passed through the old

free city at the lower rapids of the Sandusky (now Fremont),

the trail extending for over half a mile through Spiegel Grove.

This trail was traversed by the early Frenchmen and by French

war parties with their Indian allies from Detroit, in their en-

deavor to expel the British from the Ohio country, and was the

common meeting-ground of the war parties and exploring parties

of both the French from Detroit and the British from Fort Pitt.

  On the capture of Quebec in 1759 by the British, the French

surrendered all their territory in North America, and the British

sent out an expedition under Rogers to take over the French

forts. Old Fort Sandoske, originally built by British traders in

1745, but destroyed and rebuilt and destroyed again in the contest

between the French and the British, was rebuilt and left in com-

mand of Ensign Pauli. The great Ottawa chief Pontiac refused

                         <B>(429)</B>









<B>430          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to be delivered to the British and organized his great conspiracy

which early in the spring of 1763 resulted in "nine of the British

forts yielding instantly, Detroit and Fort Pitt alone escaping cap-

ture. Sandoske was the first to fall." Captain Dalyell with 260

men, marching to the relief of Detroit during its siege by Pontiac,

came upon the ruins of old Fort Sandoske, on Marblehead

peninsula, July 26, 1763, and furious at the devastation and the

sight of the decomposing bodies of Pauli's little garrison, he re-

solved on some measure of retribution. Marching inland to the

Huron village on the site of the old neutral town at the lower

rapids of the Sandusky, now Fremont, he burned it to the ground,

and destroyed the adjacent fields of standing corn.

  In the spring of 1764, General Gage, in command of the British

forces in America, sent Colonel Bradstreet from Albany and

Colonel Bouquet from Fort Pitt to punish Pontiac and his con-

federates and to regain possession of the western forts.  Brad-

street's force numbered 1,183, Israel Putnam, later the Revolu-

tionary patriot, being in command of the Connecticut battalion.

The present Fremont was the westernmost point reached by this

force. The whole army with cannon sailed up the Sandusky

River in their unwieldly batteaux, and encamped on the high

ground extending from the present site of Fort Stephenson

around the bluff to the Fair Grounds, at which latter point, as

a protection to the left of his line, Israel Putnam constructed

fleches and redoubts.    Lieutenant Montresor, engineer of the

army, noted in his diary September 22, 1764, that he had that

day been to the Huron village destroyed by Dalyell the pre-

vious year.   He "took sketches and bearings of that advan-

tageous and beautiful situation and the meanderings of the river.

Remarked that the left of our encampment is contiguous to the

remains of an old fort where the Delawares and some of the

western Indians took shelter against the Iroquois nearly one hun-

dred years ago. This construction is in the form of a circle three

hundred yards in circumference, one-half defended by the river."

   During the War of the Revolution, Daniel Boone and Simon

Kenton were each led captive along this trail through Spiegel

Grove.  Preceding and following the Revolutionary War more









             <B>EARLY HISTORY OF FREMONT          431</B>



Indian captives were brought here along this trail than to any

other place; the Moravian missionaries Zeisberger, Heckewelder,

and their followers being among the number.

  Our next knowledge of Lower Sandusky comes from Captain

Samuel Brady the scout, whom Washington sent out for infor-

mation upon the movements of the Indians of this region, and

who, concealed on the island in the river, ever since called Brady's

Island, watched the Indians race their horses along the shore.

Washington's interest in this locality was great and in 1782 he

sent General William Irvine, commandant at Fort Pitt, who noted

that a British post had been established at Lower Sandusky,

giving this place its claim to Revolutionary honors.

  The location of this free city was the two-mile square tract,

now Fremont, which constantly reappeared in the old treaties

between the Indians and the Government. The treaty of Fort

Mackintosh, January 21, 1785, reserved "two miles square on each

side of the lower rapids of the Sandusky River" in the allotment

of lands to the Indians.  This "two-mile square upon each side

of the lower rapids of Sandusky River" was again reserved by

the United States in its quitclaim to the Indians in the treaty of

Fort Harmar, January 9, I789; and in the treaty of Greenville,

from the Indians to the United States of America, August 3,

1795, Indians ceded "one piece two miles square at the lower

rapids of the Sandusky River."

  Although by the treaty of peace of 1783, the present boundary

line was established between American and British territory,

nevertheless the British, on the pretext that treaty obligations to

the loyalists had not been observed, retained possession of Detroit

and its outposts, including Lower Sandusky, and from these

vantage-points kept the Indians in a constant turmoil supporting

their claim that the Ohio River was their natural boundary. It

was not till 1796, after the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, when

the great Indian confederacy was crushed, that the British surren-

dered control of Detroit and its contiguous territory including

the two-mile square now Frement.  Tarhe, the famous Wyandot

warrior who made his home at the lower falls of the Sandusky

in the former free city, and who was the first Indian chief to









<B>432          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



make terms with Wayne, received from Wayne a promise to erect

a fort at the lower falls for the protection of himself and the

other friendly Indians. On the outbreak of the Second War with

Great Britain, and after the ignominious surrender of Detroit in

June, 1812, the American settlers fled to the Sandusky country,

and the old factor's buildings at the lower falls were transformed

into a fort under the direction of Major Wood, one of the first

graduates of West Point. In the spring of 1813, this fort was

enlarged under the direction of Colonel Stephenson, from whom

it received its name.  It was gallantly defended on the Ist and

2d of August, 1813, by the youthful hero, Major George

Croghan. General Sherman, in a letter to President Hayes em-

phasizing the importance of this victory wrote these words:

"The defense of Fort Stephenson by Croghan and his gallant

little band was the necessary percursor to Perry's victory on the

lake, and to General Harrison's triumphant victory at the Battle

of the Thames. These assured to our immediate ancestors the

mastery of the Great West, and from that day to this the West

has been the bulwark of the nation."

  In General Harrison's advance from Franklinton (now Co-

lumbus) through Delaware, and what are now Marion, Upper

Sandusky, Tiffin, Fremont, and Port Clinton to Lake Erie, to

repel the invading British and Indians, he established forts and

depots and constructed a military road following the line of the

French and Indian trail. The heavy wheels of his wagons

have left a clearly defined course which is still easily distinguished

in its winding through Spiegel Grove, although nearly one

hundred years have elapsed since the present state road was laid

out in a direct course, crossing and recrossing the old trail.

  In the campaign of 1813, owing to the insecurity of Fort

Stephenson, General Harrison selected as his headquarters Fort

Seneca, nine miles up the river, whence he could make swift trips

to Fort Stephenson, to Fort Meigs on the Maumee, to Huron and

Cleveland. During his campaign, all the noted officers of the

War of 1812, with the single exception of Andrew Jackson, trav-

elled over this trail.  General Harrison, the victorious com-

mander-in-chief, was inaugurated President of the United States









             <B>EARLY HISTORY OF FREMONT          433</B>



in 1841; Colonel Richard M. Johnson, of the Kentucky Mounted

Riflemen, "the man who killed Tecumseh," was inaugurated Vice-

President of the United States in 1837; Brigadier-General Lewis

Cass, who commanded a brigade, served as Secretary of State in

the cabinet of Buchanan; Governor Meigs of Ohio became Post-

master-General in the cabinets of Madison and Monroe; and the

venerable Governor Shelby of Kentucky always considered this

campaign as the crowning glory of his distinguished career.

  Such famous Indians as Nicolas, the renegade Huron chief,

Pontiac, Tecumseh, Little Turtle, and Tarhe the Crane were

frequenters of this old Harrison Trail and occasional residents

of this place.

  Under the treaty of 1817, the Indian title in Ohio was finally

extinguished, and the land opened for settlement. The place now

known as Spiegel Grove became a portion of the northwestern

quarter of section three in the United States Reserve "Sandusky,"

which was entered by Joseph B. Stewart and William Oliver.

When the patent was executed, however, by Andrew Jackson in

1834, it was to their assignees Jacques Hulburd, one of the first

settlers of Lower Sandusky; and to the heirs of Martin Baum.

After a partition by these owners, the first transfer was for an

undivided half and was made in 1845, by which Sardis Birchard,

the uncle of Rutherford B. Hayes, became the owner of about

one-half, including Spiegel Grove; and R. P. Buckland, who be-

came a distinguished lawyer and soldier and who had just formed

a law partnership with Rutherford B. Hayes, became the owner

of the remainder; their properties being separated by the old

state road from Lower Sandusky (Fremont) to Fort Ball

(Tiffin), now known as Buckland Avenue.

  Several years after the purchase of the Spiegel Grove tract,

Mr. Birchard removed his residence from the village to the

country home of Mr. and Mrs. James Valette, in a house built

about 1828 and now known as the Edgerton homestead. It is

near the site of Colonel Ball's victory over the Indians on the

banks of Sandusky River, on July 30, 1813, two days before

the assault on Fort Stephenson. It was to this house that Mrs.

Hayes brought Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes, of the Twenty-third

   28









<B>434          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Ohio, after his partial recovery from his severe wound at South

Mountain on the opening of the Antietam campaign in 1862.  Mr.

Birchard on his way to and from the village daily passed his new

purchase. He noted its deep woods, its pools of standing water

reflecting like mirrors (Spiegel, in German) the great trees and

tangled boughs and swaying vines; listened to the song of birds,

the hooting of owls, and the mourning of the doves; brooded over

the legends of the place, smiling at its traditional ghosts and

spooks; recognized many  a likeness to the scenes of the German

fairy tales dear to his childhood; named it Spiegel Grove and

selected it for the future home of his declining years with his

nephew, Rutherford B. Hayes.

  Sardis Birchard, this early patron of Spiegel Grove, was

born in Vermont in 1801 and was early left an orphan. On the

marriage of his sister Sophia to Rutherford Hayes, the boy of

eleven was adopted and went to live with them, and in 1817

was taken by them from Dummerston, Vermont, to Delaware,

Ohio.  In 1822 occurred the death of Rutherford Hayes and

the birth of his son Rutherford Birchard Hayes, and young

Sardis Birchard, then twenty-one years of age, in his turn as-

sumed the care of the family and became the devoted guardian

of his sister's son.  He never married.  He was a man of va-

ried culture and of the highest social and benevolent quali-

ties.  He was active in public and corporate works of progress

in northern Ohio--the  improvement of navigation, of vessel

building, of the Western Reserve and Maumee Turnpike, a na-

tional work; also of the Toledo, Norwalk and Cleveland railway;

In 1851 he organized the bank of Birchard, Miller and Co., which

in 1863 became the First National Bank of Fremont, the fifth

oldest on the list of national banks, Mr. Birchard remaining

its president until his death in 1874. He gave two public parks to

the city of Fremont, endowed a public library for the use of the

county, and gave generously to the Frst Presbyterian and other

churches of the city.

  The house in Spiegel Grove was begun by Mr. Birchard in

1859 for the permanent home of his nephew and ward, who owing

to his services in the army, in Congress, and as governor of









             <B>SARDIS BIRCHARD AND SPIEGEL GROVE          435</B>



Ohio, did not occupy it till 1873, Mr. Birchard living there until

that time and enjoying frequent joyful visits from his nephew

and later from the latter's wife and young children.

  The original house was a brick structure, two and one-half

stories high, surrounded on three sides by a veranda.  In 1880,

preparatory to his return home from the White House, President

Hayes approved plans for a substantial addition on the north,

duplicating the original brick gable front of the house, in which

were located the present large drawing-room  and library, con-

structed of slow-burning material, where were placed, on the first

and third floors, his magnificent collection of Americana. Three

additional bedrooms occupied the second story. His bedroom and

that of his only daughter on the second floor were enlarged by a

three-story bay window on the south. The interior of the original

building was remodeled to include a fourth-story cupola, which

was used by Mrs. Hayes for her house plants. The plans were

prepared and these changes carried out under the supervision of

his son and personal secretary, Webb C. Hayes, who made fre-

quent visits from Washington for that purpose. Further exten-

sive changes were made in 1889, when the entire west wing was

torn down and replaced by the present large dining-room, break-

fast-room, kitchen, and pantries on the first floor, with five addi-

tional bedrooms on the second, and six smaller chambers on the

third floor. Before these alterations were finished the beautiful

mistress of the house, who had looked forward eagerly to the

larger opportunities for hospitality, was stricken and died. Only

two rooms of the old house remain intact, the red parlor on the

first floor, and the ancestral room directly above it, which had

been Mr. Birchard's bedroom.

  The house has high ceilings, spacious rooms with hardwood

floors, and many open fireplaces. A veranda fourteen feet wide

and eighty feet long, so that thirty-three laps make an exact mile,

extends in front of the whole house.  From the centre of the

large entrance hall one can look up four stories to the observa-

tory, the upper halls forming balconies opposite the stair-

ways. On either side of the front door hang portraits of Sardis

Birchard and of his sister Sophia Birchard, the mother of Ruther-









<B>436          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



ford B. Hayes; and below the latter a charming color portrait of

her son at the age of twenty-four, soon after his graduation at

Harvard Law School. A silver plate presented to Mrs. Hayes

by the soldiers of the Twenty-third Regiment, O. V. I., on the

occasion of her silver wedding at the White House, is engraved

with a depiction of the log cabin in which Mrs. Hayes lived for

two winters in her husband's camp in Virginia; and with verse

inscribed to "Our Mother."

  The drawing-room opening to the right of the hall is thirty-six

feet long and connected by an open archway with a library of

the same length, whose shelves originally held the fine historical

library of President Hayes. This room preserves an atmosphere

of homelikeness and comfort. In the drawing-room hang life-

size portraits of President Hayes by Brown and of Mrs.

Hayes by Andrews, and other good portraits, including one of

Mrs. Hayes's grandmother, Lucy Ware, and one of President

Hayes's only sister, Fanny--both in their beautiful young wo-

manhood; portraits of Colonel and Mrs. Hayes; and two fine old

French portraits of the school of Nattier. Among the fine pieces

of old mahogany are twin chaises longues brought from France

to New Orleans during the French possession of Louisiana.

On the floor is a handsome Chinese rug made for Colonel Hayes

during the Russo-Japanese War; also a beautiful five-pronged

bronze candelabra purchased by him in 1918 at Fez, Morocco

while on a mission to confer with Marshal Lyautey, the French

Resident General in Morocco during the World War. The great

embroidered portieres were presented to Mrs. Hayes by the women

of Illinois. A fine embroidered screen in ebony frame dates from

the Philadelphia Centennial Expostion.

  A huge bishop's chair here was used by President Bashford of

Ohio Wesleyan University while conducting the funeral services

of President Hayes.

  The red parlor to the left of the hall contains a full-length por-

trait of the only daughter of the house; a water color by Turner;

oil landscapes by Bierstadt, and others.  During the funeral

services of President Hayes the chairs in the red parlor were

occupied by Grover Cleveland, ex-President and now President









             <B>DESCRIPTION OF MANSION          437</B>



elect of the United States; Governor William McKinley of

Ohio, four years later inaugurated as President; the Rev. Dr.

J. L. M. Curry, general agent of the Peabody and Slater Edu-

cation Funds; and William Henry Smith, general manager

of the Associated Press and a close personal and political friend,

Charles Foster, Secretary of the Treasury, John W. Noble, At-

torney-General, John Wanamaker, Postmaster-General, and

J. M. Rusk, Secretary of Agriculture, members of President

Harrison's cabinet, occupied the famous John Randolph of

Roanoke chairs, from the long hall; while the representatives of

the War Department, Colonel Henry C. Corbin, later lieutenant-

general, and Colonels J. C. Breckinridge and M. L. Ludding-

ton, later major-general, occupied the red damask sofa. Cap-

tain John A. Howell and Commanders Francis W. Dickins and

Edwin S. Heuston, all later rear-admirals, represented the United

States Navy, and with Colonel William E. Haynes, the Mem-

ber of Congress from Fremont, occupied the four Presidential

inauguration chairs, now in the Hayes Memorial.

  The bedroom in which both President and Mrs. Hayes died

faces the south and overlooks one of the most beautiful parts of

the grove. The furniture is of old mahogany, and the books and

pictures of Mrs. Hayes remain as arranged by General Hayes

after her death.

  One of the most beautiful rooms of the home is the large dining-

room with great windows at each end looking over the lawns.

The shelved chimney-piece over the large fireplace is devoted to

fine examples of old Chinese pottery and porcelain, and

a large exhibition pitcher of Trenton ware. The two old ma-

hogany sideboards are family heirlooms, descended from the

Birchard and Webb sides of the house respectively; two ma-

hogany serving tables from the White House, purchased during

Madison's Administration, were bought in at a public sale of

discarded furniture in 1881; and the two corner tables were

brought from Mexico by Colonel Hayes. An antique clock which

ticks circumspectly near the dining-room door was bequeathed

to the President by his grandmother and brought hither from the

ancestral Hayes homestead in Brattleboro, Vermont.









<B>438          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Scarcely less than the rooms on the first floor, the upper cham-

bers are crowded with historic and beautiful objects. The Wash-

ington room contains ebony furniture designed by a cousin, Wil-

liam Rutherford Mead, of the firm of McKim, Mead and White,

and purchased by President Hayes for use in his little daughter's

room at the White House so as to be retained by her as a

souvenir. The Birchard or ancestral room originally used by

Sardis Birchard for his own bedroom, has untold treasures from

a colonial and antiquarian point of view.

  Hardly less ancestral is the Cook Room -the maiden name of

Mrs. Hayes's mother. Here are gathered the bedroom furniture

used by President and Mrs. Hayes when they began housekeep-

ing in Cincinnati; the cradle in which all their children were

rocked; and Mrs. Hayes's old sewing-machine and lapboard on

which she made her older boys' clothing during the War for the

Union. The mantelpiece in this room was brought from the

room in Chillicothe in which Mrs. Hayes was born.

  Across the hall from the Cook Room is the Wright Room,

named for the distinguished geologist and author, G. Frederick

Wright, long president of the Ohio State Archaeological

and Historical Society, an intimate friend who officiated at the

marriage of the present occupants of the residence, Colonel and

Mrs. Webb C. Hayes.  This room contains a notable Spanish

mahogany four-post bed with tester. Opening from the Wright

Room is the Otis Room, named for the mother of Mrs. Webb C.

Hayes, and containing her wedding furniture, the Otis mahogany

cradle, the twin beds, and the mantelpiece from the Miller house

in Fremont where Mrs. Hayes lived until her marriage.  Here is

also an admirable portrait of Mrs. Miller.

  The rooms in the rear part of the house, being remodelled at

the time of the death of Lucy Webb Hayes, having no personal

sentiment, have been named by Colonel Hayes after his cam-

paigns in Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and China. Six

small bedrooms are in the third story.

  On General Hayes's personal assumption of the Spiegel

Grove property in 1873, he began to improve and beautify the

place, preserving and accentuating its natural advantages by









             <B>SPIEGEL GROVE ATTRACTIONS          439</B>



clearing out indifferent trees, extending the lawns immediately

about the house to let in the sunlight, opening vistas to throw

into relief some superb old oak or elm; and planting the hemlock

avenue and windbreaks of spruces and pines. The handsome

Japanese cypresses and deciduous trees south of the house were

sent thither from the centennial exposition in 1876, being among

the earliest of such Japanese  importations.     General  Hayes

took particular pleasure in gathering historic trees, among which

were a Napoleon willow, the forebears of which were willows

at Washington's tomb at Mt. Vernon and Napoleon's at St.

Helena; two oaks grown from acorns of the Charter Oak at

Hartford, Connecticut, and tulip trees from the Virginia home

of James Madison. General Hayes would point out to inter-

ested visitors storied trees such as the one to which savage In-

dians bound a captive maiden and built a fire about her when a

thunder-storm  burst and put out the flames.  White traders

hearing of the outrage sent a swift runner to get an order for

her release from  the Crane, the Wyandot chief; and he re-

turned in time to save the captive. Another tree with a tale is

"Grandfather's," an oak with a large hole near its base, under

which Mrs. Hayes's father camped one cold night during the War

of 1812. The story ran that he and a comrade were sent out to

forage for provisions. It was so bitterly cold that they could not

make their way back to camp, and lighting a fire at the foot of

this tree slept there in the open.  The soldiers in camp had their

feet frozen that night, but this pair were unharmed. The old

musket and hunting-horn of this Private James Webb, of the

Kentucky Mounted Riflemen, are now in the museum.

  West of the residence, in an open field adjoining Spiegel

Grove, General Hayes laid out the Lucy Hayes Chapel in young

walnut trees, with nave, transepts, and tower, - a chapel which

he used to say would be worth looking at two hundred years

hence.

  The main drive through Spiegel Grove follows the old French

and Indian trail from Lake Erie to the Ohio River, later known

as the Harrison Military Trail of the War of 1812, down which

General Harrison brought his troops on his way to Fort Stephen-









<B>440          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



son after Croghan's victory. The road enters Spiegel Grove by

the present Croghan Gateway, and leaves by the Harrison Gate-

way at the Southwest corner, continuing down to the old French

spring, and on to Ball's battlefield, Fort Seneca; Fort Ball (Tif-

fin); and Fort Ferree, Upper Sandusky, to Franklinton (now

Columbus).

  Of the many interesting events which have occurred at

Spiegel Grove the more prominent were the meeting and greet-

ing of General Hayes by his old neighbors and friends in Fre-

mont, on the evening of his third nomination for governor of

Ohio in 1875, after what he had considered his permanent re-

tirement from public life. The next year this was followed by

another gathering on his last visit home, shortly before his de-

parture from Columbus to be inaugurated President of the

United States. Six months later occurred the greatest demon-

stration in the history of the town, in the annual reunion of his

regiment, the Twenty-third Ohio, on the 14th of September,

1877, followed as it was by the dedication of the new city hall in

Fort Stephenson Park. During this reunion President Hayes

entertained the members of his regiment at a luncheon on a

table spread under five of the giant oaks of Spiegel Grove. At

this table also were General Philip H. Sheridan, the favorite bat-

tle general of the War for the Union; and the four colonels of

the regiment, Generals W. S. Rosecrans, E. P. Scammon, Ruth-

erford B. Hayes, and J. M. Comly, together with the first lieu-

tenant-colonel, Stanley Matthews, later a justice of the Supreme

Court. The five oak trees were christened for the five guests.

  Captain and Brevet Major William McKinley, also of the

Twenty-third Ohio, was the orator of the day, and other speakers

included Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite and General James A.

Garfield, after whom in later years were named the McKinley

Oaks, the Chief Justice Waite Oak and the Garfield Maple, to

commemorate visits by them. The finest elm in the grove was

christened the General Sherman Elm on the occasion of his visit

after his trip escorting President Hayes and party to the Pacific

coast and the Texan frontier posts in 1880. President Hayes was

the first Chief Executive to visit the Pacific coast during his term









             <B>SPIEGEL GROVE ATTRACTIONS          441</B>



of office. On the return of President Hayes to Fremont, after

leaving the White House, he was greeted most cordially by his

fellow townspeople and escorted to his home where he delivered

a short address in which he expressed his love for his old home

and his neighbors of many years standing. He said in the course

of this talk:

  "This is a good place to find an answer to the question which

is often heard: What is to become of the man, what is he to do,

where is his place, who having been Chief Magistrate of the Re-

public retires at the end of his term to private life? It seems to

me the answer is near at hand and sufficient. Let him like every

other good American citizen be willing promptly to bear his part

in every useful work that will promote the welfare, the happiness,

and the progress of his family, his town, his State, and his coun-

try. With this disposition he will have work enough to do and

that sort of work which yields more individual contentment and

gratification than the more conspicuous employment of public life

from which he has returned."

  Four years later as president of the Sandusky County Soldiers

and Sailors' Monument Association, President Hayes presided

at an enormous gathering at the exercises of the dedication of the

soldiers' monument in Fort Stephenson Park, to commemorate

the services of the soldiers of all wars of Sandusky County, but

particularly in memory of Major George Croghan and the gallant

defenders of Fort Stephenson on the 2d of August, 1813.

  The sudden and unexpected death of President Hayes's beloved

wife, June 21, 1889, was a great shock, not only to Mr. Hayes,

but to the community at large, and a great number of friends

gathered at Spiegel Grove to show their respect and love. His

comrades of the Twenty-third Ohio, serving as guard of honor,

marched down the old Harrison Trail to Oakwood Cemetery. A

little less than four years later, another great concourse gathered

at Spiegel Grove out of respect to the departed soldier and states-

man. Chief among the mourners was the ex-President and now

again President elect, Grover Cleveland, who made the long

journey in the midst of furious winter storms to show his fre-

quently expressed admiration and regard. With President Cleve-









<B>442          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



land in the red parlor, were gathered also members of the cabinet

who represented President Harrison; Generals Corbin, Breckin-

ridge, and Luddington, who represented the United States Army;

Governor McKinley of Ohio and the State officers and mem-

bers of the Ohio Legislature; the official representatives of the

Loyal Legion, of which President Hayes was commander-in-

chief; and representatives of many other military, literary, edu-

cational, and philanthropic organizations with which he was con-

nected. A deep snow covered the ground, trees and shrubbery,

so that the scene was most striking, the brilliant coloring of the

military trimmings, indicative of the different arms of the service,

aiding much to make it memorable.

  Four years after the death of President Hayes, his former

regimental comrade and aide, William McKinley, as President

of the United States, was an honored guest at Spiegel Grove on

the occasion of the marriage of Fanny, the only daughter. On

the following day the reunion of the Twenty-third regiment was

for the second time held at Spiegel Grove. Mrs. McKinley and

the ladies invited to meet her occupied sofas and chairs on the

roof of the broad veranda, from which they looked down on the

speakers' stand constructed around a group of five white oaks,

since called the McKinley Oaks, from which stand President Mc-

Kinley and other prominent men spoke.

  On the ninetieth anniversary of the defense of Fort Stephen-

son August 1, 1903 a memorial tablet was dedicated on Fort

Stephenson, and the George Croghan Chapter, D. A. R., held a

reception at Spiegel Grove in honor of Mrs. Charles W. Fair-

banks, the President General of the Daughters of the American

Revolution, and Mrs. O. J. Hodge the State Regent. An ad-

dress was delivered by Charles R. Williams, editor of the

Indianapolis News.  An elm was planted on the knoll by the

Daughters, and ivy from Warwick Castle at the great oaks, by

the Colonial dames of Toledo. Again on August 2, 1906, the

remains of Major George Croghan were reinterred at the foot of

the monument erected in his honor in Fort Stephenson Park,

and the grave covered with myrtle taken from the family burying-

ground at Locust Grove, near Louisville, Kentucky, where









             <B>IN HONOR OF MAJOR CROGHAN          443</B>



Croghan had originally been interred after his death in 1849.

Addresses were made at Fort Stephenson by the Hon. Charles W.

Fairbanks, Vice-President of the United States; Governor A. L.

Harris of Ohio, and others, after which a public reception was

held in their honor at Spiegel Grove.

  Just before starting on his speaking campaign during the

Presidential canvass in 1908, Judge William  H. Taft and his

wife (who as Miss Helen Herron had been a frequent

visitor at the Hayes home both in Ohio and at Washington) came

to spend a day at Spiegel Grove as the guests of Colonel Hayes,

the present owner.  They were conveyed from the Harrison land-

ing at Port Clinton, on Lake Erie, in automobiles, south over the

Harrison Trail, to Fort Stephenson, and then on to Spiegel

Grove, where they were entertained at luncheon and in looking

over the old house.  Judge Taft was advised by his host of the

custom of naming trees after distinguished visitors, and after

having had pointed out to him the General Sherman Elm, the

Cleveland Hickory, the Garfield Maple, and the McKinley Oaks,

he was invited to select his tree. He promptly advanced to one

of the grandest oaks in the grove, immediately in front of the

mansion, and placing his hand upon it said with a Taft smile:

"This is about my size!" since which time the tree has been

known as the Taft Oak.

  The Cleveland Hickory also was named by the laying on of

hands. On the occasion of the attendance of President Cleve-

land at the funeral of President Hayes, the family carriage horses

became somewhat fractious owing to the crisp air and the music

of the bands, so that as President Cleveland was about to enter

the carriage the horses made a plunge  forward.         President

Cleveland temporarily alighted and while the horses were being

brought under control he placed his right hand upon a thrifty

shellbark hickory, thereupon deemed especially appropriate to

be named in honor of the great Democrat.

  On October 18, 1908, the occasion of the annual state con-

ference of the Ohio Daughters of the American Revolution, a

brilliant reception was held at Spiegel Grove. Always after the

return of President and Mrs. Hayes from Washington, in 1881.









<B>444          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Spiegel Grove during the Summer months was the scene of

many delightful gatherings of their guests; and this custom has

been continued to the present time. Since the inauguration of

the National Rifle contests at Camp Perry, on Lake Erie, the

visiting teams, especially the members of the teams representing

the army, navy, and marine corps, have been frequent visitors for

week-end parties during the period of the contests.

  During the third reunion of the Twenty-third Ohio at Spiegel

Grove on September 23, 1909, the Harrison Gateway at the

southern entrance of the Harrison Trail into Spiegel Grove was

dedicated by the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society with

addresses by President Wright and Secretary Randall, and also

by Admiral Clark, the captain of the Oregon, after whom the

Admiral Clark White Oak was christened. The Harrison Gate-

way consists of two fifteen-thousand-pound, ten-inch Rodman

guns, standing upright, on the muzzles of which rest fifteen-inch

balls, one bearing the inscription "1775-Old French War, French

Indian Trail 1670-1760" and the other "1776-Revolutionary

War, British Indian Trail 1760-1776."



                THE HAYES MEMORIAL

  The Memorial Building, a beautiful structure of classic archi-

tecture built of gray Ohio sandstone stands among the great

trees north of the Hayes homestead, facing Hayes Avenue.

Broad steps lead up to the bronze doors of the pillared portico.

On entering the great square hall, or atrium, flanked with eight

massive columns, one passes under the flags of the countries

which claimed ownership of this region from the discovery of

America until the final surrender of Detroit and contiguous

territory, including Fort Miami (1786) on the Maumee, and the

present site of Fort Stephenson (1812) then the old factor's

building at the lower falls of the Sandusky, now Fremont, by

Great Britain in 1796. They are:

      The royal standard of Spain - 1492-1670.

      The royal standard of France - 1670-1760.

      The royal standard of Great Britain - 1760-1796.

 Displayed in groups of three on each of the four walls are









             <B>THE MEMORIAL BUILDING          445</B>



the flags of the thirteen colonies and the state flags of Vermont,

Kentucky and Ohio; Vermont and Kentucky being the States

from which the parents of Rutherford B. Hayes and Lucy Webb

Hayes migrated to Ohio. The flag of the United States, with

the stars in the blue field indicating the growth of the Union, is

the centre of each group. The shield beneath bears the inscrip-

tion:

  Over the door leading to the east library is the flag of the

governor of Ohio.  Rutherford B. Hayes served three terms,

being inaugurated in 1868, 1870, and 1876. Inserted in the wall

beneath the flag is the headstone from the original grave of Mrs.

Hayes with the inscription:



                Lucy Webb Hayes, 1831-1889.



The flag of the President of the United States hangs above the

door leading to the west library, Rutherford B. Hayes being the

nineteenth President, 1877-1881, and beneath this is the compan-

ion headstone from the original grave of President Hayes, in-

scribed:

              Rutherford B. Hayes, 1822-1893.



In the spring of 1915, the monument and the caskets were trans-

ferred from Oakwood Cemetery, Fremont, to their final resting

placed on the knoll in Spiegel Grove, and placed in a huge granite

slab over which the original monument was reerected.

  In the centre of the atrium are unique relics from China,

where gunpowder and poison gas were first used in warfare.









             <B>THE MEMORIAL BUILDING          447</B>



A bronze cannon with numerous Manchu hieroglyphics, used in

the Manchu conquest of China, in 1645. One of many guns used

by the Boxers in their attacks on the foreign legations in Peking,

in the summer of 1900, and also used against the Relief Column

which captured the Tartar city of Peking, August 14, 1900. One

of three guns brought home by Colonel Webb C. Hayes, of Ma-

jor-General Chaffee's staff.

  Also a Chinese stink-pot used to throw noxious bombs into

fortified cities or armed vessels, the fumes of whose poison gas

caused the desertion thereof in early Chinese wars. First used

by the Germans in the defence of their trenches when they were

forced to dig in after their lines were pierced by General Foch,

in their repulse before Paris by Marshal Joffre, in 1914; and

further developed by the Germans and copied by the allies during

the remainder of the war.

  On entering the building, the first things that catch the eye

are the portrait of President Hayes, painted by Carl Rakemann,

representing him at the age of seventy shortly before his death;

the Huntington portrait, painted for the White House, and

copied by Rakemann, representing him at sixty, while President,

in the west library; and the Andrews portrait in the east

library showing him at forty, in the uniform of a brevet major-

general of volunteers. Thus, standing in the centre of the

atrium, one can see lifelike portraits of General Hayes, at forty,

sixty, and seventy years of age. Over his portrait in the atrium

is the Hayes coat of arms, from his Scottish ancestor, a falcon

lighting on a rock which bears the inscription Recte.  From the

atrium one sees in the west library also Rakemann's copy of

the Huntington portrait of Lucy Webb  Hayes, painted for the

Woman's Christian Temperance Union, for the White House, and

accepted by President Garfield to hang on the walls of the White

House.

  All of the windows in the Memorial Building have been

utilized by placing in them transparencies of colored portraits or

scenes of special local interest, painted and arranged by the artist,

Carl Rakemann, of Washington, D. C.









<B>448          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



                  THE EAST LIBRARY.

  The east library contains the three-quarter portraits by An-

drews of General Hayes in the uniform of a brevet major-gen-

eral, and of Mrs. Hayes. Corner cases contain the dress and

uniform worn by Fanny Hayes, aged ten, and Scott, aged seven,

at a Martha Washington children's costume ball, given at the

White House. The other cases contain gowns worn in the White

House by Mrs. Hayes. The windows show colored transpar-

encies of Major George Croghan, the gallant defender of Fort

Stephenson against the British and Indians, August 1st and 2d,

1813, who was promoted and awarded a gold medal, and six of

whose officers, each with a sword, by the Congress of the United

States for gallantry in the defense of Fort Stephenson; Lieuten-

ant-Colonel John C. Fremont, the Pathfinder and Explorer, after

whom the town was named, when changed from Lower Sandusky

in 1849; and the local representatives in each of the wars since

the Declaration of Independence, namely: Private James Webb,

aged 18, father of Lucy Webb Hayes, who served here in Spiegel

Grove in Captain Garrard's Company, Kentucky Mounted Rifle-

men, in the War of 1812; Captain Samuel Thompson who was

wounded at Lundy's Lane, Canada, in the War of 1812, and or-

ganized and led the company from Sandusky County, in the War

with Mexico, 1846-48, in which Rutherford B. Hayes was to

have been the second-lieutenant until found disqualified by the

surgeons at Cincinnati; Major-General James B. McPherson, the

officer highest in rank and command killed in battle during the

War for the Union 1861-65; and Sailor George B. Meek, the

first American killed in the War with Spain, 1898-90,--the last

three of whom are buried in Sandusky County.



                  THE WEST LIBRARY.

  The west library is devoted to the more personal souvenirs.

Here are copies of the celebrated portraits of the President

and Mrs. Hayes, painted for the White House by Daniel

Huntington and copied by Carl Rakemann by permission of

President Wilson. In front of these portraits stands an interest-









             <B>TREASURES IN LIBRARY          449</B>



ing relic of the battleship Maine, her bronze hand-steering gear,

covered with barnacles and tarnished by sea water, now utilized

as a receptacle for flowers. A companion table to the one in the

east library is here. Two large mahogany cases display many of

the costumes worn by Mrs. Hayes at the White House, and other

articles of dress used during her life from her babyhood to her

last public appearance at the centennial of the inauguration of

George Washington at New York in April, 1889. Also her

diploma from the Wesleyan Female Seminary of Cincinnati in

1850, together with her valedictory address and original manu-

script of several essays written by her before her graduation.

  The north window was dedicated by the Croghan Lodge, I.

O. O. F., of which President Hayes was an honored member.

The colored transparencies are portraits of Brevet Major-Gen-

eral Hayes; Sardis Birchard, the uncle and guardian of President

Hayes, a pioneer merchant, banker, and philanthropist of Lower

Sandusky (Fremont), and the builder of the residence at Spiegel

Grove; Brevet Major-General Ralph P. Buckland, soldier, con-

gressman, and pioneer lawyer, who was the law partner of Gen-

eral Hayes at Lower Sandusky (now Fremont) from his ad-

mission to the bar in 1845 until he removed to Cincinnati in

1849. Biographical sketches add to the interest of these portraits.

Smaller transparencies show the funeral of Rutherford B. Hayes

with all honors of the nation after his death at Spiegel Grove

January 17, 1893; "Old Whitey," a hero of nineteen battles,

"Black Yauco," Colonel Webb C. Hayes's war-horse, a veteran of

the campaigns of Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Phillipines, the fast-

est runner, the highest jumper, and the fastest swimmer at Manila,

during the Christmas week festivities, 1899-1900. This horse

was afterwards ridden only by Colonel Hayes at the second in-

auguration and at the funeral services of President McKinley

at Canton in 1901, and by his nephew Midshipman Webb C.

Hayes at the inauguration of President Taft in 1909.  Old

Whitey, General Hayes's war-horse, and Black Yauco, Colonel

Hayes's war-horse, are buried with Piddig and Old Ned, just out-

side the enclosure on the knoll, with suitably marked tablets.

  The south window shows portraits of Major-General William

   29









<B>450          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Henry Harrison, commander of the Northwestern Army during

the Second War with Great Britain, 1812-1814; and Commodore

Oliver Hazard Perry, commander of the American Squadron at

the Battle of Lake Erie, September 10, 1813.



                 THE LIBRARY MUSEUM

  The Library Museum contains General Hayes's war relics and

war photographs and numerous curios collected on his trips while

President. His complete horse equipment, saddle, bridle, pistol

holster, mess chest, with dishes of iron and heavy stoneware, and

bedding roll, with numerous other personal effects used in the

war are found in Japanese Case No. 1. Other show cases contain

a fairly large collection of guns, pikes, swords, flags, and other

articles captured in the early months of the War for the Union.

Other cases contain samples of equipment carried by members of

his regiment, and others a collection of war-time photographs,

etc., including a collection of political badges dating back to the

Harrison campaign of 1840, with many valuable souvenirs of Lin-

coln's campaign for the Presidency.

  A collection of hunting and Indian and war relics made by

Colonel Webb C. Hayes who, for thirteen years prior to the death

in 1890 of his godfather, Major-General George Crook, the most

famous hunter and Indian fighter of the United States Army,

went on long hunting trips with him in the wilds of the Rocky

Mountains, is shown in cases. There is also a collection of war

curios made while he served as major of the First Ohio Cavalry,

through the campaign of Santiago de Cuba and in the invasion of

Porto Rico, in the War with Spain; while serving as lieutenant-

colonel of the Thirty-first U. S. Infantry during the insurrection

in the Philippines, extending from General Young's campaign in

northern Luzon, where Colonel Hayes won the much coveted Con-

gressional Medal of Honor for distinguished gallantry in the

relief of Vigan, December 4, 1899, down to the campaign against

the Moros of Mindanao where his regiment was the first Amer-

ican garrison of that island, with headquarters at Zamboanga,

from 1899 to 1901. There is also a collection made during the

Boxer insurrection in China, where he served on Major-General









             <B>THE BASEMENT MUSEUM          451</B>



Chaffee's staff in the China Relief Expedition of 1900. Subse-

quent campaigns which he attended as an observer are represented

by interesting collections made during the Russo-Japanese war,

when he served with General Kuroki's Japanese army on the

march through Korea to the Yalu river, and later with the Rus-

sian army in the vicinity of Mukden.  There are also many ob-

jects of interest obtained by him during his last service--in the

World War - in France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Morocco.

During the first months of hostilities he secured at Louvain three

porcelain cups, the only articles saved from the library.

  In the windows of the museum have been placed also illum-

inated portraits of the landing of Columbus on the discovery of

America in 1492; a portrait of Amerigo Vespucci, after whom

the Western Hemisphere was named; and five portraits of famous

characters of the Indians, the Spaniards, the French, and the

British who had to do with this part of Ohio, prior to the forma-

tion of the American Commonwealth after the Declaration of

Independence. It is the intention to place in the upper sash of

each of these windows portraits of the famous Americans who

have had to do with military campaigns in this region or were

natives of it, in the campaigns of the Revolutionary War, the

War of 1812, the War with Mexico, the War for the Union, the

War with Spain, the insurrection in the Philippines, the China

Relief Expedition of 1900, and in the great World War.

  The large American flag which floats over the Memorial

Building was presented by the Colonel George Croghan Chapter,

D. A. R., on Flag Day, June 14, 1915.

  The family barouche, purchased by President Hayes in March,

1877, and used as the President's carriage during the Adminis-

tration of President Hayes and the brief Administration of Presi-

dent Garfield, has a place in the basement museum beneath the

Library. It was ridden in by all the Presidents from Grant to

McKinley, and by all of our leading generals, Grant, Sherman,

Hancock, Schofield, Miles, and Crook, while guests of President

Hayes. Nearby stands a miniature three-story doll house, which

was on exhibition at a fair in Baltimore, and then presented to

Fanny Hayes, aged ten, and used by her at the White House.









<B>452          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



   In the basement museum also are a large elk-horn chair, pre-

sented by Seth Kinman, California hunter and trapper, to Gov-

ernor Hayes, during the presidential campaign of 1876, and a

revolving chair made from Texas steer-horns; also a huge bear

trap, presented to Mr. Hayes while President by the Oneida

Community, and subsequently used by Webb C. Hayes on sev-

eral of his hunting trips in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains

with General George Crook, in one of which he caught a large

black bear, which proved more dangerous to kill than either

of the three grizzly bears killed by him in these hunting experi-

ences; also a full-mounted Rocky Mountain sheep, killed by Gen-

eral George Crook, and a mounted black-tailed deer, killed by

Colonel Hayes, are on exhibition; likewise an admirable as well

as rare collection of American Indian garments, together with

bows, arrows, scalps and Indian totems, with tomahawks and

pipes in two upright cases and two long horizontal cases. On the

wall hangs the history of Little Bad Man, a Sioux Indian.

  Windows show in photographic transparencies the Norwalk

Academy at which Rutherford B. Hayes was a pupil in 1836;

Isaac Webb's School at Middletown, Connecticut, where he pre-

pared for college in 1837; Kenyon College, from which he was

graduated in 1842; and the Dane Law School of Harvard Uni-

versity from which he was graduated as a Bachelor of Laws in

1845. Lucy Ware Webb was one of the early graduates of

schools for girls. She was a student with her brothers at the

Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware during her brothers'

course of four years from 1844 to 1848 before young women

were regularly admitted, and while a student met for the first

time her future husband, then on a visit to his old home in Dela-

ware. Her later school is shown in a transparency of the Wes-

leyan Female College in Vine Street, Cincinnati, from which she

was graduated in 1850.

  Other transparencies are the home of President Hayes's great

grandfather, Captain Ezekiel Hayes of the Revolutionary army,

at Branford, Connecticut, built in 1756; the home of his son,

President Hayes's grandfather, Ensign Rutherford Hayes of the

Revolutionary army, at West Brattleboro, Vermont, built in









             <B>THE LIBRARY MUSEUM          453</B>



1780; the home of his son, Captain Rutherford Hayes of the

War of 1812, at Dummerston, Vermont, and his later home

after his migration to Delaware, Ohio, in 1817, where he built

the first brick dwelling-house in that village in 1822, and where

his son, Rutherford Birchard Hayes, the future President, was

born October 4, 1822, a few months after his father's death.

  Other transparencies represent the Ohio homes of Rutherford

B. Hayes after his marriage at Cincinnati, December 30, 1852.

One is his town residence No. 383 Sixth Street, Cincinnati, which

was his legal residence for twenty years after his marriage, al-

though he was absent during the last ten of these years while

serving in the Union army, as a Member of Congress, and as

Governor of Ohio for two terms. Another photograph represents

the old Justice Swayne house, now the site of the Public Library

in Columbus, Ohio, where he lived for nearly three years in

his three terms as Governor of Ohio. The home in Spiegel Grove

is shown in two transparencies, one representing the original

house built for him by his uncle in 1859, but occupied by him only

for the three years just before his election as President in 1876.

The other represents the Hayes homestead as it has been since

the death of both the President and Mrs. Hayes.

  Over the entrance of the Library Museum addition is an oval

marble profile bust of Rutherford B. Hayes. After entering the

museum, over the entrance, in a glass case, is the regimental

flag of the Twenty-third Ohio Infantry, originally presented by

Lucy Webb Hayes to the regiment when it veteranized after three

years' service in 1864, when Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes was

promoted to brigadier-general and left the regiment. It was re-

turned to Mrs. Hayes when the regiment was mustered out in

Cleveland in June, 1865. Also, a regimental flag of the Twenty-

third O. V. V. I. Association, used at the regimental reunions, and

presented by the survivors, through Sergeant James Hayr, at the

centenary celebration of the birth of Rutherford B. Hayes,

October 4, 1922; and the headquarters garrison flag of Colonel

Hayes, Twenty-third O. V. I., flown over the winter quarters

of the regiment at Camp Eugene Reynolds at the Falls of

the Kanawha, Virginia, during the winter of 1862-63; also at









<B>454          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



winter quarters at Camp White, opposite Charleston, West Vir-

ginia, during the winter of 1863-64; and at winter quarters at

Camp Hastings, Cumberland, Maryland, during the winter of

1864-65. On the sides are brigade headquarters flag of Brigadier-

General Rutherford B. Hayes during the War for the Union,

First Brigade, Kanawha Division, and the brigade headquarters

flag of Brigadier-General H. F. Devol, successor of General

Hayes in command of the First Brigade, Kanawha Division,

draped in mourning on receipt of the news of the assassination of

President Lincoln, April 14, 1865. Also, the division head-

quarters flag of Brevet Major-General Rutherford B. Hayes,

commanding Kanawha Division, 1864-65. In the large upright

case on the west are the regimental flags of the First Ohio Caval-

ry in the War with Spain, of which Captain M. W. Day, Ninth

U. S. Cavalry, was lieutenant-colonel commanding, and First-

Lieutenant J. E. Runcie (late U. S. Artillery) and Webb C.

Hayes were the two regimental majors. Major Hayes was

wounded when his horse was killed in the assault on San Juan

Hill at Santiago de Cuba, July 1, 1898, but continued to serve as

adjutant-general, brigade commissary, and brigade quartermaster

of the Second Cavalry Brigade, vice Captains A. L. Mills and M.

J. Henry, wounded, and First-Lieutenant Wm. E. Shipp, Tenth

U. S. Cavalry, killed in the assault. He was recommended for a

brevet commission and recently received a citation for gallantry

at Santiago de Cuba. In the large upright case on the east are

the regimental flags of the Thirty-first Regiment U. S. Infantry,

of which Captain J. S. Pettit, First U. S. Infantry was colonel,

Major Webb C. Hayes was lieutenant-colonel, Captain L. M.

Brett, Second U. S. Cavalry (later brigadier-general in the World

War), Captain Hunter  Liggett, Fifth U.  S. Infantry  (later

lieutenant-general, and second in command in the World War),

and First-Lieutenant J. E. McMahon, First U. S. Artillery (later

brigadier-general in the World War), were the regimental majors

for service in the Phillipine Islands, serving as the first American

garrison among the Moros of Mindanao from 1899 to 1901, with

regimental headquarters at Zamboango.

  Below the regimental flags of the Twenty-third Ohio Infantry

hangs an oil painting, representing the arrival of Marshal Joffre









             <B>THE LIBRARY MUSEUM          455</B>



of France, the hero of the First Battle of the Marne, July 6, 1914,

and the Hon. Arthur J. Balfour of Great Britian, representing

the Allied Mission, at the National Capitol in Washington, in

April, 1917; painted and presented to the museum by Carl Rake-

mann of Washington.

  On the west of the entrance is the Lincoln desk, a walnut

roller-top desk, purchased for the original Cabinet Room on the

second floor of the White House, during the Administration of

Abraham Lincoln, and used through the subsequent Administra-

tions of Presidents Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur,

Cleveland, Harrison, and McKinley. In the renovation of the

White House during the Administration of President Roosevelt,

it was sold for ten dollars, and purchased by Webb C. Hayes,

who, as a youth, used this desk and chair even during cabinet

meetings, while serving as the personal secretary of his father.

  On the east of the entrance is Rutherford B. Hayes's bookcase

with the first law books used by him when he began practice at

Lower Sandusky, now Fremont, as a member of the firm of

"Buckland and Hayes" -Ralph P. Buckland and Rutherford

B. Hayes--1845 to 1849, and until his removal to Cincinnati

in 1850. On the tops of these two desks are celestial and ter-

restrial globes, presented to the President and Mrs. Hayes.

  The window in the south door, opposite, contains colored trans-

parencies of the east front and west front of the National Capitol

at Washington; the inauguration of President Hayes in 1877;

the inauguration of President Garfield, President Hayes' succes-

sor, in 1881; the north front and the south front of the White

House; and the northwest corner of the State-house and the

west front of the State-house at Columbus, showing the gov-

ernor's office and the monument to "Ohio Jewels," namely,

General U. S. Grant, General W. T. Sherman, General P. H.

Sheridan, Secretary of War E. M. Stanton, Chief Justice S. P.

Chase, President Rutherford B. Hayes, and President James A.

Garfield.

  Midway between these doors is a grandfather's clock, purchased

by Rutherford Hayes, father of President Hayes, on his marriage

to Sophia Birchard in Vermont in 1812. When the family moved









<B>456          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



to Delaware, Ohio, from West Dummerston, Vermont, in 1817,

the clock, because of its length, would not permit the tailboard of

the wagon to be in place for the long journey across the Allegheny

Mountains. The clock was sold to relatives, by whom it was

later brought to Ohio, and returned to the Hayes family as a

bequest of Mrs. Linus Austin in 1915.

  On top of the clock stands the owl, which, by dangling on the

plumb-bob in the Washington Monument, when the old stone

foundation was being carefully removed and a new concrete

foundation placed in its stead, a very delicate engineering feat,

nearly caused the despair of the engineer in charge, who thought

that his foundation had proved insufficient and that the monument

was wabbling.

  Near the clock is a marble-top walnut water table, also pur-

chased for the original Cabinet Room, during the Lincoln Ad-

ministration, on which a silver decanter with two silver cups pro-

vided fresh ice-water for the President and his callers, from the

Administration of President Lincoln until after the death of

President McKinley.

  The Library Museum contains a specimen cannon or shell-case

captured in each of the wars in which the United States has been

engaged since the Declaration of Independence.

  Revolutionary War,  1776-1783.  A  bronze cannon with the

British coat of arms, and the royal ciphers of King George and

of King Louis, probably showing it was a gift from the King of

France to the King of England.        Inscribed by direction of

General Benedict Arnold, a commander of victorious American

troops at the Battle of Saratoga:

                            "Taken

                            at the

                            of the

                         British lines

                        near Saratoga

The name of Benedict Arnold was erased, as it was from all

trophies, by direction of the Continental Congress after his treach-

ery. The manufacturer's mark below is: "R. Gilpin Fecit 1761."

  Second War with Great Britain, 1812-14. A bronze Coehoorn

mortar with the British coat of arms and King George's royal

cipher, captured during the Second War with Great Britain.

  War with Mexico, 1846-1848. A bronze cannon with the in-

scription "San Juan," captured in the War with Mexico. This

was one of the four bronze guns known as the Apostles' Battery

or the Four Apostles, presented by the King and Queen of Spain

to Cortez and used in the conquest of Mexico and later in the

war for the Independence of Texas and the subsequent War with

Mexico. Of the remaining three guns, St. Matthew, St. Mark

and St. Luke, one is on exhibition at West Point on an entrance

to the library, and the others in front of the War Department at

Washington.

  War for the Union, 1861-1865. A brass six-pound gun, in-

scribed "Louisiana," captured during the War for the Union.

  War with Spain, 1898-1899, and the Insurrection in the Philip-

pines, 1899-1901. A single-barrelled bronze Spanish lantaka, and

a double-barrelled bronze Spanish lantaka, together with three

bronze or brass Spanish helmets and Spanish coat of mail which

hang among the Moro exhibits on the south wall, all presumably

taken by Magellan to the Philippine Islands after his discovery of

them in 1521, following his passage through the Straits of Magel-

lan, and later captured by the savage Moros of Mindanao, and

presented to Lieutenant-Colonel Webb C. Hayes Thirty-first U. S.

Infantry, commanding the first American troops at Reina Regen-

ta, Mindanao, during the winter of 1899-1900. Datto Piang

welcomed him at Reina Regenta and fired a salute from fifty-one

captured bronze Spanish cannon and lantakas, presenting the

double-barrelled lantaka as a souvenir of the visit. The single-

barrelled lantaka was presented to Colonel Hayes by the

Sultan of Mindanao, when he escorted the Sultan to his state

barge at the dock of Parang Parang. He presented the Sultan

with a fancy penknife, whereupon the Sultan proposed to give him

a return present of ten of his three hundred Moro wives. Be-









<B>458          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



fore the tragedy of the delivery of the wives, Colonel Hayes in-

dicated his preference for the lantaka on the state barge, near

which he was standing, in lieu of the ten wives, to the surprise

and apparent disgust of the Sultan.

  Chinese Boxer War of 1900. Two iron Chinese cannon of

small calibre, used in the Manchu conquest of China; part

of the guns surrendered by the Boxers after their attacks on the

foreign legations in Peking. A bronze Chinese cannon, with

numerous Manchu hieroglyphics, used in the Manchu conquest of

China in 1645, --one of three guns brought home by Lieutenant-

Colonel Webb C. Hayes, of Major-General Chaffee's staff,--

stands in the atrium. This was one of many guns used by the

Boxers in their attack on the foreign legations in the summer of

1900, and also used against the Relief Column composed of two-

thousand Americans, two-thousand British, four-thousand Rus-

sians, and eight-thousand Japanese, which on August 14, 1900,

captured the Tartar city of Peking. Of the other two cannon

brought home by Colonel Hayes, one was presented to the mu-

seum of the West Point Military Academy and one to the

Western Reserve Historical Society of Cleveland, of which he

is a trustee.

  On the wall above the iron Chinese cannon and the Lincoln

marble-top walnut water table, already described above, hang

Chinese imperial (or Boxer)  uniforms, Chinese man's kimono

and boy's costume, and a collection of sawed-off rifles of

the Chinese, who were the earliest users of gunpowder-match-

lock, flintlock, percussion cap, and needlegun. Also, Chinese

spear, halberd, and sword; two Chinese bows with quivers of

Chinese arrows, including whistling arrows, which were dis-

charged in the air so as to give a weird whistling sound like that

emitted by bad spirits, and carried by both pursued and pursuers,

so that the pursuers could use them in case they became the pur-

sued; a queue from the head of a Chinese who was one of ten

executed for looting and murder on the day following Colonel

Hayes's arrival in Peking; Chinese fishing spears and three

Chinese flags, captured during the Boxer Insurrection of 1900,

and representing a Chinese swallowing the Japanese insignia









             <B>FOREIGN WAR RELICS          459</B>



(causing severe indigestion). The Chinese changed their flag

every time they were defeated. The fact that they were usually

defeated explains the different designs of flags. The large yellow

flag from the Chinese Imperial Summer Palace was captured by

the Russians and looted from them by Colonel Hayes. The small

maroon silk flag was captured by him on an American expedition

from Peking, sent out to rescue Chinese Christians.

  War on the Mexican Border, 1916-1917. Two metallic cases

for fixed ammunition for French field-pieces, used by the

Mexican bandit Villa in his raids on Columbus, New  Mexico,

in 1916. The ammunition was cached near Colonia Dublan,

Mexico, the headquarters of Major-General Pershing's Expedi-

tionary Force, and was captured and presented to Colonel Hayes

by Major Robert L. Howze, a former comrade, and adjutant-

general of the First Brigade Cavalry Division at Santiago de Cuba

in 1898; lieutenant-colonel of the Thirty-fourth U. S. Infantry in

General S. B. M. Young's campaign in northern Luzon, P. I., in

1889, where he captured Appari, and was promoted to brigadier-

general; and again a brigadier-general in France during the

World War; now major-general, commanding the Fifth Corps

Area with headquarters at Fort Hayes, Columbus, Ohio.

  World War, 1917-1918. German shells and curios in Japanese

cases No. 2 and No. 3.

  A carillon of bells hangs between the two central columns

with two bronze Catholic mission bells, one used as an ash tray

and cuspidor in the prison occupied by Lieutenant Gilmore, U.

S. N., and American sailors while prisoners in Vigan, northern

Luzon, September, 1899; the other, broken in the engagement

at Laoag, presented to Colonel Hayes by the Spanish padre in ap-

preciation of rations furnished to the seven-hundred Spanish

soldiers who had been held as prisoners of war by the Filipinos.

These were fed with American  rations  until they  were  re-

patriated to Manila en route to Spain in 1899.  Also, Chinese

temple bells, captured in the relief of Peking, which, when

swayed by the wind, gave forth low sweet notes to weary way-

farers.  Above are three bells of precious metals-gold and

silver-made for the Spanish Conquistadors, Francisco Pizarro

in 1541 and Hernando de Soto in 1589. Also, in the adjoining

upright show-case are candle-sticks, spoons, and plates, the latter,

with the inscriptions:

  "En  Honor Don Francisco Pizarro, Gran  Capitan  y Con-

quistador y Primer Governador Del Peru, Cuzco, Ano D  1541."

  "En Omenaje Al Capitan Don Diego De Almagro Conquistador

Del Peru, Cuzco, Ano (D) 1541."

  "Don Hernando De  Soto, Gran Capitan Conquistador, Ano

(D) 1589."



  On the centre columns hang two grandfathers' guns of the

War of 1812, the old flintlocks used by Rutherford Hayes of

Brattleboro, Vermont, and James Webb of Lexington, Kentucky,

when they were young men and before their removal to Ohio.

Captain Rutherford Hayes, of the Vermont Militia, removed

from West Dummerston, Vermont, to Delaware, Ohio, in 1817.

James Webb, who served as a youth of eighteen in Captain

Garard's Company of Kentucky Mounted Riflemen in General

Harrison's northwestern campaign at Fort Meigs, Fort Seneca,

and Fort Stephenson, before his invasion of Canada, subsequent-

ly was graduated from Transylvania University, Lexington, Ken-

tucky, and began the practice of medicine at Chillicothe, Ohio.

There he married Maria Cook, who was born there in 1801 and

whose father, Judge Isaac Cook, migrated to Ohio in 1792 from

Connecticut. This Isaac Cook was the third of the name (father,

son, and grandson), who served in the Revolutionary War. The

first Isaac Cook was a captain and collector of military supplies in

Connecticut. His second son Isaac was colonel of a Connecticut

regiment, in which his young son, the third Isaac, was his orderly.

  Below the grandfathers' guns hang two glass-fronted wall

cases. The case on the west contains the military equipment of

Rutherford B. Hayes during the four years of the War for the

Union:

   Sword carried while major, lieutenant-colonel, and colonel

  FIVE INDIANS, NATIVES OF OHIO-EAST WALL



                  NICOLAS, OR ORENTONY

                        Died 1748.

     A renegade Huron Chief from the French at Detroit,

who permitted British traders to erect old Fort Sandoski of 1745,

   the first fort built by white men within the present

        limits of Ohio, on the portage between the

              Sandusky River and Lake Erie.

               PONTIAC, AN OTTAWA CHIEF

                  born 1720-died 1769,

               who, as an ally of the French,

   refused to accept the British king as his Great Father

      after the surrender of French sovereignty in 1760.

He organized the great conspiracy in which he seized nine

  British forts, Fort Pitt and Detroit alone escaping capture.

Sandoski was the first to fall, 18 May, 1763, when the fort was

burned and the garrison, with the exception of Ensign Pauli,

                      were massacred.

    LITTLE TURTLE, OR MISHIKINAKWA, A MIAMI CHIEF,

                  born 1752-died 1812,

            distinguished in council and in war.

He organized the largest force of Indians ever gathered against

  the whites, but was defeated by General Anthony Wayne

      in the Battle of Fallen Timbers near the British

    fighting against Gen. Harrison's Northwestern army

            at the Massacre of the River Raisin,

       Siege of Fort Meigs and the Dudley Massacre.

                    TARHE, "THE CRANE,"

       a war Chief of the Wyandots of the Sandusky,

      De Lery, the French engineer officer from Quebec,

  whose journals of numerous trips through the Ohio country

       between Quebec and as far south as New Orleans,

         by Major George Croghan, 17th U. S. Inf.,

         with 160 men and one cannon, "Old Betsy."

The defense of Fort Stephenson was our one land victory on

   American soil during the War of 1812 and was recognized

      by Congress voting a gold medal to Major Croghan

  and a sword to six of his officers engaged in the defense.

      and his capture of Captain Barclay's British fleet

       at the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813,

        Major-General Harrison's northwestern army,

   with headquarters at Fort Seneca on the Sandusky River,

         down the river to Fort Stephenson and on to

the shore of Lake Erie, opposite the mouth of the Sandusky River,

    where his army was embarked on Commodore Perry's

victorious fleet and transported across the lake for the American

  invasion of Canada which resulted in the final defeat of

    Proctor's British army and the death of Tecumseh at

      the Battle of the Thames on the 5 October, 1813.



                CAPTAIN ROBERT H. BARCLAY

    and, with his Lieutenant, J. G. Gordon, was buried with

          military honors at the northeast corner of

              Garrison Street and Park Avenue.

               The portrait of Colonel Shortt,

 now on the walls of the Birchard Library on Fort Stephenson,

  was forwarded by one of his descendants in England for the

centennial celebration of the defense of Fort Stephenson in 1913.
