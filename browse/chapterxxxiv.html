  WITH  characteristic penetration, Mr.  Hayes had  foreseen

the possibility of an indecisive election.  In the Diary on

October 22, two Sundays before the day of balloting, he wrote:-

"Another danger is imminent- a contested result. And we have

no such means for its decision as ought to be provided by law.

This must be attended to hereafter. We should not allow an-

other Presidential election to occur before a means for settling

a contest is provided." The reports election night seemed to

indicate Democratic success, as forty years later similar reports

were hastily interpreted as showing a Republican victory. Mr.

Hayes himself had little doubt of his defeat. Men forgot for

the moment that, if the election was close, the returns that night

from the Far West and the South were too meagre to justify

confident assumption of the national decision. It soon became

apparent that the Presidency hung upon a single electoral vote,

and both parties insistently claimed the victory. There ensued

months of clamor and controversy. The patience, the patriotism,

and the statesmanship of the American people were taxed to the

uttermost to devise a peaceful method of determining the critical

dispute. Mr. Hayes himself maintained a dispassionate attitude

throughout the heated contention; and whatever his personal

views as to the proper method of procedure might be, he reso-

lutely refrained from any public expression of them, and stead-

fastly refused to seek to influence the opinion or action of any

Senator or Member of Congress in reaching the final adjust-

ment.]

  Saturday, November 11.--The election has resulted in the

defeat of the Republicans after a very close contest.

  Tuesday evening a small party assembled in our parlor to

hear the news. General Mitchell and Laura, our boys, Birch and

             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          375</B>



Webb, Governor Dennison, a reporter of the Chicago Tribune,

Mr. Huntley, W. K. Rogers, Rutherford Platt, and a few others

at times.-Emily Platt, Dr. Fullerton, and Fanny.

  The first dispatch was from Rutherford [his son at Cornell],

showing a majority of  in Ithaca, New York, and a gain of

--- over Grant in 1872.  We all felt that the State of New York

would decide the contest. Our last dispatches from our commit-

tee in New York were very encouraging -full of confidence.

Mr. A. B. Cornell, Chairman New York State Committee, said

in an experience of ten years he had never seen prospects

brighter on the eve of an election. But we all knew -warned

by the enormous registration in the cities of New York and

Brooklyn and other facts- that we must not count confidently

on carrying the State. The good omen from Ithaca was ac-

cepted with a quiet cheerfulness.

  Almost at the same instant came a gain of thirty-six in Ball-

ville, the township nearest my own home. This was good. Then

came, one at a time, towns and precincts in Ohio. The compari-

son was made with the vote in 1875, instead of with the vote of

October last. This was confusing. But soon we began to feel

that Ohio was not doing as well as we had hoped. The effect

was depressing. I commanded without much effort my usual

composure and cheerfulness. Lucy felt it more keenly. With-

out showing it [her depression], she busied herself about re-

freshments for our guests, and soon disappeared. I found her

soon after abed with a headache. I comforted her by consoling

talk; she was cheerful and resigned, but did not return to the

parlor. Without difficulty or much effort I became the most

composed and cheerful of the party.

  At- P. M., or thereabouts, we heard that in some two hun-

dred districts of New York City, Tilden had about twenty thou-

sand majority, which indicated fifty thousand in the city. The

returns received from the rural districts did not warrant the

belief that they would overcome such a large city majority. From

that time, I never supposed there was a chance for Republican

success.

  I went to bed at 12 to 1 o'clock. Talked with Lucy, con-

soling her with such topics as readily occurred of a nature to









<B>376          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



make us feel satisfied on merely personal grounds with the result.

We soon fell into a refreshing sleep and the affair seemed over.

Both of us felt more anxiety about the South -about the colored

people especially--than about anything else sinister in the re-

sult.  My hope of a sound currency will somehow be realized;

civil service reform will be delayed; but the great injury is in the

South.  There the Amendments will be nullified, disorder will

continue, prosperity to both whites and colored people will be

pushed off for years.

  But I took my way to my office as usual Wednesday morning,

and was master of myself and contented and cheerful.  During

the day the news indicated that we [had] carried California;

soon after, other Pacific States; all New England except Con-

necticut; all of the free States West except Indiana; and it

dawned on us that with a few Republican States in the South

to which we were fairly entitled, we would yet be the victors.

  From Wednesday afternoon the city and the whole country

has been full of excitement and anxiety.  People have been up

and down several times a day with the varying rumors.  Wednes-

day evening on a false rumor about New York, a shouting multi-

tude rushed to my house and called me out with rousing cheers.

I made a short talk, saying [as reported by the papers] :-

  "Friends. -If you will keep order for one half minute, I will

say all that is proper to say at this time. In the very close political

contest, which is just drawing to a close, it is impossible, at so

early a time, to obtain the result, owing to the incomplete tele-

graph communications through some of the Southern and West-

ern States.

  "I accept your call as a desire on your part for the success of

the Republican party.  If it should not be successful,  I shall

surely have the pleasure of living for the next year and a half

among some of my most ardent and enthusiastic friends, as you

have demonstrated tonight."

  From that time, the news has fluctuated just enough to pro-

long the suspense and to enhance the interest. At this time the

Republicans are claiming the election by one electoral vote.

With Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, we have carried

one hundred and eighty-five [electoral votes].  This creates great









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          377</B>



uneasiness. Both sides are sending to Louisiana prominent men

to watch the canvassing of the votes.

  All thoughtful people are brought to consider the imperfect

machinery provided for electing the President. No doubt we

shall, warned by this danger, provide, by amendments of the

Constitution, or by proper legislation, against a recurrence of the

danger.

  Sunday, November 12. -The news this morning is not con-

clusive. The headlines of the morning papers are as follows:-

The News, "Nip and Tuck"; "Tuck has it"; "The Mammoth

National Doubt";-and the Herald heads its news  column,

"Which?"  But to my mind the figures indicate that Florida has

been carried by the Democrats.        No  doubt both  fraud and

violence intervened to produce the result.  But the same is true in

many Southern States.

  We shall, the fair-minded men of the country will, history

will hold that the Republicans were by fraud, violence, and in-

timidation, by a nullification of the Fifteenth Amendment, de-

prived of the victory which they fairly won. But we must, I now

think, prepare ourselves to accept the inevitable.  I do it with

composure and cheerfulness.  To me the result is no personal

calamity.

  I would like the opportunity to improve the civil service.  It

seems to me I could do more than any Democrat to put Southern

affairs on a sound basis. I do not apprehend any great or per-

manent injury to the financial affairs of the country by the

victory of the Democrats. The hard-money wing of the party

is at the helm.  Supported, as they should be and will be, in all

wise measures, by the great body of the Republican party, nothing

can be done to impair the national credit or debase the national

currency. On this, as on all important subjects, the Republicans

will still hold a commanding position.

  We are in a minority in the Electoral Colleges; we lose the Ad-

ministration.  But in the former free States - the States that

were always loyal - we are still in a majority. We carry

eighteen of the twenty-two and have two hundred thousand ma-

jority of the popular vote.  In the old slave States, if the recent









<B>378          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Amendments were cheerfully obeyed, if there had been neither

violence nor intimidation nor other improper interference with

the rights of the colored people, we should have carried enough

Southern States to have held the country and to have secured a

decided popular majority in the nation. Our adversaries are in

power, but they are supported by a minority only of the lawful

voters of the country. A fair election in the South would un-

doubtedly have given us a large majority of the electoral votes,

and a decided preponderance of the popular vote.

  I went to church and heard a good, strong, sensible sermon

by Critchfield's son-in-law. After church and dinner I rode with

General Mitchell and his children out to Alum Creek and around

past the place of my old friend Albert Buttles. We talked of

the Presidential question as settled, and found it in all respects

well for me personally that I was not elected. On reaching

home at Mitchell's, we found my son Webb with the following

dispatch from Governor Dennison, a prudent and cautious gentle-

man, which seems to open it all up again: -



                  WASHINGTON, D. C., November 12, 1876.

                          Received at Columbus 2:05 P. M.

To GOVERNOR R. B. HAYES.

  You are undoubtedly elected next President of the United

States. Desperate attempts are being made to defeat you in

Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, but they will not suc-

ceed.

                                             W. DENNISON.

  In the evening I asked if there were objections to publishing

this dispatch. About 10 P. M. reply came, "No objections."



                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 13, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - I am in receipt of your note of the 10th.

I can, on personal grounds, accept defeat, if that is the issue,

with the greatest composure, and almost with satisfaction.

  While I believe that with a fair election in the South, our

electoral vote would reach two hundred, and that we should have

a large popular majority, I am yet anxious, as you are, that in the









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          379</B>



canvassing of results there should be no taint of dishonesty.<B>*</B>

I have had no part in sending leading men South. If you, at

any stage of the proceedings, feel like going to Louisiana, it

would gratify me if you go. Hewitt's men are many of them

ex-Republicans, and of course bitterly prejudiced against their

late associates.              Sincerely,

                                                  R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, November  13, 1876.

  MY DEAR S-: -Thanks for your letter. Perhaps I ought to

say in a word how much I am obliged to you.  No correspondent

during the one hundred and forty-four days has been so valued

as you, and my debt dates before and is likely to grow after that

period.

  I am in the habit, for a day or two past, of saying: "Un-

doubtedly, a fair election in the South would have given the Re-

publicans a large majority of the electors, and also of the popular

vote of the nation; and I think that a fair canvass of the result

will still give us the one hundred and eighty-five votes required

to elect."                     Sincerely,

                                                  R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



Confidential.

                         FREMONT, OHIO, November 23, 1876.

  MY DEAR GUY: - Your letter addressed to me at Columbus is

before me. While I regret that you should be annoyed by the



<FONT SIZE="-1">  * Mr. Schurz had written: -"Today there seem to be good grounds

for hope again for sufficient legitimate majorities in Florida, South

Carolina, Louisiana, and thus of your election. If this turns out to be

the result, accept my congratulations in advance. Your satisfaction can

scarcely be greater than mine.-I am sure, you are as anxious as I am,

and as every patriotic citizen must be, that such a result should not be

tainted by any suspicion of unfair dealing. I think the idea put forth

in several quarters that some men of high character should go to

New Orleans to watch the proceedings of the Returning Board, is a very

good one. The Democrats are already sending some of their prominent

men, and it ought to be done on our side."</FONT>









<B>380          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



loose report of my conversations, I cannot write anything on the

subject for the public. What I say is for yourself alone. My

general views on the Southern question were given authoritatively

and correctly in my Letter of Acceptance. I was not aware that

anybody was reporting my conversations on the result and con-

sequences of the election until I saw the publication you refer to.

That report is correct enough as far as it goes, but it is not

complete.

  My feeling was and is, that a Democratic victory at this time

will prove especially calamitous to the South -not to the colored

people alone, but to the white people also. The South can't

prosper without immigration and capital from the North and

from abroad.    This remark is not equally applicable to the

States west of the Mississippi. But it is measurably true there

also, I suspect.  Doubtless you will have a large immigration

from the old Southern States which will help you.  Now, that

the tendency of a Democratic victory is to drive off Northern

people, is a thing perfectly well known here. At least, such is

my opinion. Possibly, your better opportunity of judging may

correct my notions as to its effect on the colored people, but its

effect on the interests of the white people I have better means

to know than you have.

  I can't see why your Democratic friends should annoy you on

this utterance of mine. The leading Democratic organ of the

party North, the New York World, complimented me on this

very point, and said it was an evidence of humanity and states-

manship.

  I believe (I hope I am  mistaken) that Southern Democrats

think it was a monstrous wrong to give the colored people the

ballot, and that it is excusable in them if they, the Southern

Democrats, in effect nullify the provisions of the Constitution

which secure this right to colored men. I hope sincerely that

the Southern Democrats will take the advice of the World, and

thus disappoint my apprehensions. In any event, I am the well-

wisher of all of my countrymen in the South.  I hope they will

take the only course which can give them peace and prosperity.

  Whatever the issue of this business, my affection for you will

not fail, but I shall remain "as ever" your friend.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE GUY M. BRYAN,

       Galveston.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 26, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:-Returning after an absence of over a

week at Cleveland, Fremont, and Toledo, I found here last night

your note of the 18th. I know your presence at New Orleans

would be important for good, but under the circumstances you

mention, you could not be reasonably asked to go.

  It seems to me you are correct as to the propriety of the course

thus far taken by the Returning Board.  Sherman writes  me

commending Wells and Anderson as acting conscientiously and

judiciously.  He  thinks our right to the State unquestionable.

At many polls, besides the parishes usually named, there was

most  atrocious  means  used  to prevent  colored  people  from

voting the Republican ticket.

  I feel the gravity of the situation. To be counted out will be

a relief; but if otherwise, I will keep my thoughts on the true

interests of the country, and endeavor to do precisely right.

  I shall be glad to hear from you often.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.-I failed to meet General Cox at Toledo.            He  was

absent from the State. This I regret. -H.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 27, 1876.

  MY  DEAR SIR: -I am greatly obliged for your letter of the

23d. You feel, I am sure, as I do about this whole business.

A  fair election would have given us about forty electoral votes

at the South -at least that many. But we are not to allow our

friends to defeat one outrage and fraud by another. There must









<B>382          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



be nothing crooked on our part. Let Mr. Tilden have the place

by violence, intimidation, and fraud, rather than undertake to

prevent it by means that will not bear the severest scrutiny.

  I appreciate the work doing by the Republicans who have

gone South and am especially proud of the acknowledged honor-

able conduct of those from Ohio. The Democrats made a mis-

take in sending so many ex-Republicans.        New  converts are

proverbially bitter and unfair towards those they have recently

left.

  I trust you will soon reach the end of the work, and be able

to return in health and safety.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN,

      New Orleans.



  Columbus, November 30, 1876.  Thanksgiving.- The Presi-

dential question is still undecided. For more than two weeks it

has seemed almost certain that the three doubtful States would

be carried by the Republicans. South Carolina is surely Republi-

can. Florida is in nearly the same condition, both States being

for the Republicans on the face of the returns, with the probabil-

ity of increased majorities by corrections. Louisiana is the State

which will decide. There is no doubt that a very large majority

of the lawful voters are Republicans. But the Democrats have

endeavored to defeat the will of the lawful voters by the perpe-

tration of crimes whose magnitude and atrocity has no parallel

in our history. By murder and hellish cruelties, they at many

polls drove the colored people away, or forced them to vote the

Democratic ticket. It now seems probable that the Returning

Board will have before them evidence which will justify the

throwing out of enough [votes] to secure the State to those who

are lawfully entitled to it.

  Thanksgiving dinner and evening at Laura's. A happy time.

  December 1, 1876. -Colonel Roberts of [the] New Orleans

Times wanted an interview with me. Had lunch at Comly's.

After lunch he said he called on me to give me the views of









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          383</B>



Lamar, of Mississippi, General Walthall, ditto, Wade Hampton,

of South Carolina, and probably [General] Gordon, of Georgia.

  "You will be President," [he said]. "We will not make

trouble. We want peace. We want the color line abolished.

We will not oppose an Administration which will favor an honest

administration and honest officers in the South. We will favor

measures to secure the colored people all of their rights, We

may not, and probably will not, leave the party of opposition,

but such an Administration as you can have, we will support as

men of the opposite party can.  We want nothing of you in the

way of promise or pledge."

  This was the substance. I replied by saying I was gratified to

know it. That my Letter of Acceptance covered the whole

ground; that it meant all it said and all that it implied. This was

the substance.

  In case of my election there will be further conference, and

I hope for good results.

  December 3.  Sunday. - Various indications lead me to think

that in Louisiana the report of the Returning Board will probably

be unfavorable. No doubt a fair election would have carried the

State for the Republicans. But it is possible that the wrong

cannot lawfully be corrected by the Returning Board. But sup-

pose they do correct without sufficient warrant of law. The

returns will be made to the President of the Senate, and on their

face the Republicans will have a majority. Suppose a way is

found to go behind those returns to the Senate. Should not,

in that event, the whole case be gone into? Should not the

equitable result be reached? Not only throw out the Democratic

majorities where violence procured them, but count in fairly the

honest Republican majorities which were prevented by lawless-

ness ?



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 4, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -I send you the letter enclosed from a

very sound man, A. F. Perry, of Cincinnati, hoping it will re-

assure you.  I am very hopeful that Grant's Administration will

be wise and prudent until this business is ended. The facts in









<B>384          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



every case are grossly distorted by unfriendly hands in the tele-

graph offices of the South.  This is not mere partisan talk.  I

have it from the best sources.  This should make us hesitate in

our judgments of all occurrences in that quarter. - Please re-

turn Mr. Perry's letter.

                            Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.





  Columbus, December 5, 1876. -Yesterday Elwood E. Thorne

and Francis  A. Stout, of the Republican Reform Club of New

York, came here and had an interview with me.  The purport

of their communication, written and oral, was that New York was

lost by coldness and neglect (perhaps treachery) on the part of

the New York managers of the canvass; meaning Cornell [and]

some of the Federal officers --- generally. I suppose, friends of

Conkling.  Their facts were not very conclusive, but tended to

show a lack of hearty support.

  In the afternoon a number of Republicans who have been in

New Orleans to witness the proceedings of the Returning Board,

on the Invitation of the  President, or of the National Republican

Committee, stopped here on their return East.  Senator Sherman,

General Garfield, Eugene Hale, of Maine,  Mr. Stoughton and

General Van Alen, of New York, and General White, of Indiana

County, Pennsylvania, constituted the party. Courtlandt Parker

[of New Jersey] did not stop, but returned with this party.  They

called on me at my office about 3 P. M., General Comly and Webb

being present.  They spread before me very fully the condition

of things in Louisiana, and the action of the Returning Board.

They emphatically endorsed the general fairness and honesty of

the board's conduct.  They  said it was the opinion of all of the

Republicans Who went down to New Orleans that the Republican

ticket was lawfully  and honestly entitled to be declared elected.

That largely more parishes and polls ought to be thrown out

for violence and intimidation than were necessary to elect the

whole Republican ticket state  and national;  that a fair election

would have given the Republicans not less than thirteen to fifteen









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          385</B>



thousand majority; that the intimidation was deliberately planned

and systematically executed by means of rifle clubs organized in

the parishes selected for the process of intimidation known as

"bulldozing."

  I asked each of the gentlemen for his individual views. All

concurred in saying in the strongest terms that the evidence and

law entitled the Republican ticket to the certificate of election,

and that the result would in their opinion be accordingly.<B>*</B> They

spoke highly of Wells and Anderson [of the Returning Board],

and favorably of the two colored men.

  Thanks to Laura and Webb they were all entertained, with

Honorable A. F. Perry [of Cincinnati], at our house last evening.

It was a jovial little gathering. Lucy and Laura, the only ladies.

Lucy and I before they came took tea with Mrs. Price at Mr.

John L. Gill's.

  Columbus, December 6, 1876. - Last evening we gave a recep-

tion to the Ohio Electoral College, all present, [and] General

Wikoff and State Republican Committee. My neighbors, Patter-

son, William G. Deshler, and John L. Gill, Denny Rogers, and

a very few others. During the evening we got dispatches from

Governor Kellogg, Mr. Packard, and Mr. Ray, of Louisiana,

showing Hayes electors chosen by over three thousand. This



<FONT SIZE="-1">  *Mr. Parker, whom a professional engagement had called directly

home, wrote Mr. Hayes from Newark, New Jersey, December 5, saying: -

"If the count finally reported by the Returning Board in Louisiana shall

entitle the Republican electors to their certificate, you need have no

scruples against their votes. I attended almost all the sessions of the

board. They were especially fair and open. Technicalities received no

favor. I acquainted myself likewise, so far as the nature of things

permitted, with the evidence upon the subject of intimidation. No one

except returning officers can speak as to the extent to which this evidence

is applicable. I can only say that if the testimony I have not seen is

like that with which I have been made acquainted, the exclusion of any

votes affected will be justifiable, and that the conduct of the board

shows them to be men in whose judgment and desire to do right full

confidence may be placed. The law of Louisiana as to this matter is the

law of the Union. The board is vested by that law with full jurisdiction

in the premises. And from what I have seen of them [the members of

the board] I shall be ready to acquiesce as readily in their decision,

while all must allow, I suppose, that it is legally final."</FONT>

out Florida. Wires down in Florida! Mrs. Herron, Laura, and

Emily Platt, with Lucy, did the honors, and the affair was suc-

cessful.

Private.

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 6, 1876.

  MY  DEAR SIR: -I have read your article [in the Westliche

Post of December 3] on the mode you suggest for determining

contested Presidential elections. Its general tone and purpose

strike me favorably. What is wanted is an Article [in the Con-

stitution] which shall practically embody the views you maintain.

The suggestion is not in a condition for presentation. We can't

say yea or nay to it until we see it in form for a place in the

Constitution.

  I am overwhelmed with callers, congratulating me on the re-

sults declared in Florida and Louisiana. I have no doubt that

we are justly and legally entitled to the Presidency.

  My conversations with Sherman, Garfield, Stoughton, and

others settled the question in my mind as to Louisiana.

                           Sincerely,

  The whole story<B>*</B> referred to in your letter is a fabrication.

Nothing of the sort occurred. Assure my friends of this.

of the party in the South."</FONT>









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          387</B>



  Columbus, December 7, 1876. - The Electoral College of Ohio

met yesterday. Mr. Perry presided. A unanimous vote for

Hayes and Wheeler. All passed off pleasantly. During the day,

I received dispatches from Pennsylvania, Illinois, and South

Carolina, showing that in these States the colleges voted for

Hayes and Wheeler. In the evening, Platt, Laura, Emily, and

Fanny came in with General Mitchell, Dr. Fullerton, and Ruddy

Platt, and later Mr. John W. Andrews and Mrs. Andrews, and

Miss Grayson. We received dispatches during the evening from

all of the Republican States except Florida, Iowa, Nebraska,

Colorado, and Oregon.

  We all felt doubts about Oregon. The vote of the State was

indisputably Republican by eleven hundred majority and over.

But one of the Republican electors, it has been charged, is in-

eligible, being a postmaster. The Democratic governor heard

argument on his right to refuse to give him a certificate. All this

we knew. It led me to think there was a probability that the

governor would commission the highest Democrat on the de-

feated ticket and thus give Tilden the one hundred and eight-five

votes required to elect. We retired after our visitors left, having

had a lively, happy little gathering, but with this doubt and

solicitude about Oregon on our minds.

  This morning Isaiah, our colored man, when he came in to

build the fire, laid the State Journal on our bed.  He lighted the

gas and I read the telegraphic accounts, showing how Governor

Grover of Oregon had refused to commission Watts, the Repub-

lican elector, an ex-postmaster, and had given the certificate of

election to Cronin, the highest Democratic elector, and how he,

Cronin, had met as the college and elected two Republicans to

fill the two vacancies created by the refusal of the Republicans,

two of whom were commissioned, to act or meet with him; and

how this college met and cast two votes for Hayes and Wheeler

and one for Tilden and Hendricks, thus giving in the nation to

Hayes and Wheeler one hundred and eighty-four electoral votes

and to Tilden and Hendricks one hundred and eighty-five votes,

and in this way electing the latter President and Vice-President.

  The two regularly commissioned Republican electors met;

Watts, the postmaster resigned, was re-elected, and this college









<B>388          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



gave Hayes and Wheeler the three votes of Oregon, making their

aggregate one hundred and eighty-five, and thus electing them,

if this vote is treated as the true one.

  Here is the danger. A contest ruinous to the country, danger-

ous, perhaps fatal to free government may grow out of it.  I

would gladly give up all claim to the place, if this would avert

the evil without bringing on us a greater calamity. I am de-

termined that no selfish ambition or interest shall influence my

conduct in the face of these tremendous events.  Whatever, on

the whole, is best for the country, that I will do if I can know it,

regardless of consequences to myself. I shall keep cool, master

all tendencies that may lead me astray, and endeavor to act as

Washington would have acted under similar circumstances.

  My wife feels some disappointment, is unhappy on account

of the consequences of our defeat to the poor colored people of

the South, but on personal grounds is contented, and will without

effort show her usual cheerfulness. We shall both bear this new

responsibility with composure.    Our  friends will suffer more

than we shall, whatever the suspense or the final result.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 7, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - Since writing yesterday I have heard

of the unwarranted action of Governor Grover of Oregon. It

perhaps does not at all change the duties of public men in rela-

tion to the important subject of your Amendment. Judge Ed-

munds has an Amendment which is intended to provide a remedy

for the difficulty. How does it consist with the plan you have

in view? I prefer not to be quoted until I am better informed

as to the specific plans proposed.

  One thing you can count on: I mean to do my duty unin-

fluenced by selfish ambition or interest.  I feel very strongly

that in the presence of the tremendous dangers now threatening

us, we should all try to be deliberate and calm-not hasty to

condemn or to act - remembering always what an unmixed evil

civil war is.

                           Sincerely,

  GENERAL C. SCHURZ.                             R. B. HAYES.









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          389</B>



  December 8. - The Oregon fraud appears to have been carried

out in so bungling a way that it is not likely to do more than

complicate matters.  Indeed, it now looks as if it would damage

our adversaries in the public judgment without in any manner

injuring us.  The fraud is so transparent, palpable, and  dis-

graceful, that it is not impossible that it will be thrown aside

without dissent from any quarter.

  Columbus, December 16, 1876.- We returned last night from

Dayton. Our visits with John W. Herron, at Cincinnati, and

Richard C. Anderson, at Dayton, were most happy.  Lucy was

in excellent spirits.  Webb (who left us at Cincinnati) picked

up a knowledge of Cincinnati public men, which he wanted, and

had a good time generally. At Dayton I made an offhand talk

which seemed to be successful. Several hundred people shook

hands with a gushing sort of enthusiasm, and I was visited by

many of the best people. The ladies were very civil to Lucy.

At Springfield the people, especially the workingmen, turned out

in great force. I spoke from the rear of the car until the train

moved on. The weather has been favorable; rather cold, but

bright and clear.



                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 16, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: - Thanks for your favors. Touching the busi-

ness of Mr. Shaw, I am free absolutely from committals as to

persons or policies.  People who talk to me are listened to re-

spectfully, and I talk quite freely up to the point of my Letter,

and other public utterances, but I have no private assurances

for any of my visitors.  I have no prejudices which will prevent

me from listening to suggestions impartially.

  I mean to keep myself free as long as practicable, and to hear

in a friendly spirit all that may be offered. I do not like to

mention names, but this disposition extends to all.  My desire

is to have a strong, wise, and successful Administration. All

personal considerations must yield to this. I want to hear from

you fully, freely, and confidentially.

                           Sincerely,

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.                         R. B. HAYES.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 16, 1876.

  MY DEAR S-: - I have three letters from you. Do not think

if I write little that I underestimate my obligation to you for

what you are doing. I value your letters and note all you say

carefully. I am very hopeful that much good will come from

friendly relations with good men South -sooner or later. But

one thing I may still say to all friends. That is, I am perfectly

free from committals as to persons and policies, except as im-

plied in my Letter and other public utterances. There is nothing

private.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



                             COLUMBUS, December 16, 1876.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -I am exceedingly obliged for your let-

ters. Your views are so nearly the same as mine that I need

not say a word.     I am wholly uncommitted on persons and

policies, except as my published letters and other public ut-

terances show. There is nothing private. The war feeling has

no hold in Ohio worth a moment's consideration. The lawful

result will be received as it should be. I am overwhelmed with

letters and other affairs, so excuse this crusty note.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE J. A. GARFIELD.



  December 17. - Yesterday Colonel Albert D. Shaw, consul at

Toronto, came from Washington to talk with me about affairs

there, and [concerning] my purposes as to persons and policies.

He is a friend of Senator Conkling, and seemed to be on inti-

mate terms with the Secretary of War [Cameron] and others

in high places. He talked forcibly and with much feeling. He

fears that the apprehension that I am in the hands of the reform

element of the Republican party, will lose me in the Senate the

friendship and support of enough Senators, in the approaching

struggle in the Senate, to change the result of the Presidential









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          391</B>



election, and bring in Mr. Tilden. Mr. Conkling has been com-

mitted against our present views on some of the legal questions

now before the country; notably, as I infer, on the right of the

Senate and House to pass on the returns of the electoral colleges.

The Southern Republican Senators are afraid they will be ig-

nored, as "carpetbaggers," or [as] otherwise objectionable under

the Hayes policy of conciliation. Names were not mentioned,

but Spencer, of Alabama, Dorsey, of Arkansas, Clayton, and Con-

over seemed to be the Senators Colonel Shaw was thinking of.

  I told Colonel Shaw I had concluded that I ought to take no

part in the pending contest in Washington; that I should prob-

ably make no declaration of policies, and no committal as to

members of my Cabinet, until the result was announced in Feb-

ruary. That I stood on my Letter. That as to Southern affairs,

it [the Letter] plainly indicated what I thought desirable. That

the Southern people must obey the new Amendments and give

the colored men all of their rights; that peace in that country

could only be had in this way; that prosperity would come to the

South with immigration from the North and from Europe; that

to get this, people must feel as free to go to the South as they

now do to go to Kansas or Nebraska; that I had no private

views or pledges to give; that what I said to him I said publicly,

and to all who called on me and desired to know my views.

  He showed the reasons why Mr. Conkling took no active part

in the canvass; that his health was broken, and his eyes required

that he should remain in a dark room. He explained the bad

faith of [George William] Curtis towards Conkling; of Bristow

towards Conkling and Grant; of [Governor] Morgan towards

Conkling, etc. He urged the appointment of Conkling (or rather

of his being offered the appointment) as Secretary of State.

Spoke well of Platt, of Morrill, of Maine, of [the] Secretary

of War; and in disparagement of Chandler, Blaine, and Jewell.

  Although I gave him no pledges, and merely said, as to ap-

pointments, I would try to give just consideration to the claims

of all sections of the Republican party, he seemed to be pleased

with what I told him. He evidently came with a desire to be

pleased, and left, professing to think he could overcome diffi-

culties at Washington.

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 17, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:--Colonel Shaw has been here and returned.

He seemed pleased with his interview.  Of course, no pledges or 

assurances were given, beyond those which are public and [are]

given to everybody. I told him I was in no way committed to

persons or as to policy except as the public knew; that I would

try to deal fairly and justly by all elements of the party; and [I]

talked as I always do about the South. He thinks he can remove

some difficulties on his return. It seems to me I should remain

quietly in Ohio, and take no active part in present complications.<B>*</B>

But I will be glad to hear from you, and will rely much on your

views.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 17, 1876.

  MY DEAR GOVERNOR:--I am exceedingly obliged for your

valuable letters. It seems to me desirable that I should remain

quietly in Ohio, committing myself to no person or policy beyond

that which the public may fairly infer from my Letter and other

published and authorized utterances. Believing firmly that I

have been honestly and legally elected, I propose to wait con-

tentedly for the issue.  If the result is changed by violence, fraud,

or treachery, I shall suffer less than my friends -less than the

country; and, I may truly say, I shall suffer chiefly on their

account.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM  DENNISON.



<FONT SIZE="-1">  * Mr. Sherman had written December 9:--"There is a strong feeling

in certain quarters here that you should come to Washington in an

informal way with a view of conferences as to some important points.

My judgment has not inclined me as yet to the necessity or propriety of it,

but it may be that events will occur to render it expedient for you to

come, of which you will be advised in time. Please turn it over in your

mind, so as to be prepared if the request should be sent you.  In case

you come it would be better for you to stay with me, rather than at

the President's or at a public house, but of this I will advise you

further."</FONT>

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 24, 1876.

  MY DEAR S-: - Enclosed I return you the letters [giving in-

formation of efforts being made by Colonel A. J. Kellar, of

Memphis, General Henry V. Boynton, Washington correspondent

of the Cincinnati Gazette, and others to create and encourage

Hayes sentiment in the South]. I do not wish to be committed

to details. It is so desirable to restore peace and prosperity to

the South that I have given a good deal of thought to it. The

two things I would be exceptionally liberal about are education

and internal improvements of a national character. Nothing

I can think of would do more to promote business prosperity,

immigration, and a change in the sentiments of the Southern

people on the unfortunate topic. Too much politics, too little

attention to business, is the bane of that part of our country.

  I go to Xenia- Orphans' Home - Monday evening and re-

main until Tuesday evening. Could you meet me there Tuesday?

                          Sincerely,

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 25, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:-I have your esteemed favor and have also

met Judge Taft and Governor Dennison. There will not be the

slightest difficulty growing out of the matter you refer to. You

know my general course of conduct. It has always seemed to me

wise in case of decided antagonisms among friends not to take

sides - to heal by compromise, not to aggravate, etc., etc. I wish

you to feel authorized to speak in pretty decided terms for me

whenever it seems advisable-to do this, not by reason of

specific authority to do it, but from your knowledge of my gen-

eral methods of action.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.

   [The letter, to which the foregoing is a reply, is so significant

that it is given in full:

        UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER, December 22, 1876.

  DEAR GOVERNOR: - I send you today two documents in regard

to counting the electoral votes, which I know you will read with

attention, being McDonald's and Wheeler's compilation of facts

occuring when the electoral votes were counted from 1789 to

1873.

  A subject of a good deal of delicacy has been much talked of

within the last ten days here, and I have been urged by members

of the Cabinet, and Senators of high influence, to write you about

it, but it seemed to me so delicate a thing to do that I declined at

first. I have, however, joined with Morton in a written request

that Judge Taft would stop and speak to you fully the strong

feeling of the President in regard to a gentleman high in position

in this country, and he has agreed to do so. Governor Dennison,

also, who left last evening is pretty well informed of the matter

and will no doubt speak to you about it.

  I cannot conceal my anxiety about the action of several men

in the Senate whose votes may be decisive in the construction of

a law or joint rule for the counting of the electoral votes. The

case now on paper is so plain that I am extremely solicitous that

no concurrent act of the two Houses shall impair it; still it is

manifest that from the precedents some joint action of the two

houses will be taken, and it seems to be conceded that if the two

Houses should agree in rejecting a return there is no way to help

it, and the President would feel bound to recognize it. I have

said enough to show you my earnest conviction that no feeling of

prejudice or hostility should operate upon the mind of President

or Senators, and that it is right for you to frankly remove any

misapprehension, if you can do so without abandoning the

position you have taken as a waiting spectator of the canvass.

When persons of influence come to me to write to you I am very

reluctant to do so; but I do wish that some ready mode of com-

munication could be had with you.

  I do not know whether you have written to the President

since the meeting of the Electoral Colleges, but it would seem to









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          395</B>



me an act of simple courtesy to write him if you have not already

done so. His present position, great public services, and friendly

conduct would justify extreme deference to his opinions.

                       Very truly yours,

                                           JOHN SHERMAN.]

  GOVERNOR R. B. HAYES,

      Columbus.



Private.

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 29, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:- I wish in strict confidence to say that in

case our adversaries go to law with us, I shall want you to assist

the Attorney-General. Let your thoughts dwell on the points

that may be raised either to question our rights or simply to

perplex and annoy us.

  One other matter: My judgment is that neither House of

Congress, nor both combined, have any right to interfere in the

count.  It is for the Vice-President to do it all.  His action is

final. There should be no compromise of our constitutional

rights. We should firmly insist upon them.

  Again, allow me to assure you that I am in no way committed

as to persons or policies. No one is authorized to commit me. I

shall remain free to the end.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I am exceedingly obliged for your interesting

note of the 25th. Without expressing any opinion on the points

you state so clearly, I may suggest a query: Can an Act of

Congress take from the Vice-President the authority (the duty)

the Constitution has vested in him?

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  Columbus, Ohio, December 30, 1876. - Twenty-four years ago

today we  married.    A  happy  event for me,  for us both.

We look back with satisfaction. Our children are good.

  We have had cold weather this month. The Ohio frozen

over; navigation closed.  Yesterday a deep snow fell on the

well prepared ground.

  The political event of the week is the visit made me by Judge

T. J. Mackey, of Chester, South Carolina, with a letter from

General Wade Hampton. Mackey is a fluent and florid talker.

His representations are such as lead one to hope for good results

by a wise policy in the South. The letter is not of much im-

portance except as it indicates General Hampton's views of duty

in case of armed resistance by the Democrats. I have a dispatch

from C. P. Leslie as follows:- "I warn you to beware of Tom

Mackey.  .  .  . He is a first-class fraud.  . .  ."--This is

a specimen of the Southern complications.





                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 31, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR:- I still think I ought to leave Washington

well alone. I have many friends in that city who can of their

own motion speak confidently of my ways of thinking and acting.

An authorized representative could remove some troubles that

you now see, but only think of yet greater troubles he might

create.

  I like to get your suggestions, and am interested in the facts

you give. Do not misconstrue my silence if in the hurry of time

I fail to reply.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE J. A. KASSON.



                      COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 31, 1876.

  MY DEAR GOVERNOR:-- I have your letter of the 30th. I have

not looked into the question you suggest. With the aid of Little

I will be able to get at the truth. I am glad you mentioned it.

It did not occur to me as a question.









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          397</B>



  The grand demonstration I had not heard of. Such affairs

need judicious looking after by somebody, but, of course, I

cannot interfere with them.

  Something like your views as to a friend or friends at Wash-

ington has been mentioned by a good many. There are two sides

to it. It seems to me that Comly and Shellabarger and Dennison

can give such facts about my general ways of thinking and

action as will accomplish all that is right and practicable.

  I am in the habit of saying that we can better afford defeat

by the knavery of the adversary or the crotchets or treachery of

friends than success by intrigues. Of course, I understand you

to mean that we must have men at Washington prepared to de-

feat the corrupt practices of our adversaries. For this purpose

the gentlemen I name can be useful, and other of our friends who

may be in Washington can lend a helping hand. This must be

left to volunteers. For me to select and send to Washington a

representative would, in my judgment, be a mistake. Think of it.

I will hear and heed, but you have my decided impression.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL E. F. NOYES.



Private.

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, December 31, 1876.

  MY DEAR SIR: -I recognize the friendliness and sincerity of

your purpose, but it seems to me it would be a mistake for me to

send a representative to Washington. There are several Ohio

men in Washington who know my methods of thinking and acting

in public affairs. They can of their own motion speak confi-

dently. Such men as Shellabarger, Comly, Noyes, Little, etc.,

etc., not in official positions at Washington, and various Senators

and Representatives can perhaps do and say all that can properly

be said and done. All this must, I am confident, be left to

volunteers, such as the men I name or allude to. Don't misunder-

stand me. I am ready to hear and to heed the suggestions of

friends. But I see this business today as above indicated.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  MY  DEAR COLONEL:-Thanks from Scott for the Indian

"shinny." I don't remember the name you gave it.

  I shall be glad to see you any time.  I go to Fremont for a few

days within a fortnight or so. With that exception, I expect to

be here during January.

  Of course friends see my duty variously. I must adhere to

my own views. You notice how I am charged with bargaining

to get the place. It is a great comfort to feel how unfounded

all such stuff is. We can better afford defeat by the knavery of

adversaries than to win by intrigue - bargain and sale. At any

rate, I see the true position to be "hands off."

                          Sincerely,

  Columbus, January 1, 1877. - A deep snow; six to ten inches

  Columbus, Ohio, January 2, 1877. - Our cousin Mary Birch-

accident at Ashtabula, Friday evening. We have learned none of

the particulars as to her fate beyond the general facts of the catas-

trophe. The accident was the most dreadful that has ever oc-

curred on any railroad in Ohio, and has rarely been equalled

in the number of victims and other circumstances of horror any-

  MY DEAR SIR: -I am greatly obliged for your full letter. It

is all interesting.

  The questions in my thought, when I wrote you, were such

as may arise, after the count is declared in favor of the Republi-

can candidates, between them and the Democrats who are also

sworn into office. Such as quo warrantos, etc., etc.; efforts to

get or keep possession of the government offices and property,

and the like. In short, the questions Tilden can make, claiming

to be de jure President and the Republican de facto.

  On the Louisiana vote our equitable right to the State is in-

disputable. I will send you in a day or two Redfield's letter.

If we go back of the Returning Board, why not go into the

merits? How would Louisiana have voted if the election had

been fair?

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE S. SHELLABARGER.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 3, 1877.

  MY DEAR S-: - I am not a believer in the trustworthiness of

the forces you hope to rally. After we are in, I believe a wise

and liberal policy can accomplish a great deal. But we must

rely on our own strength to secure our rights. With firmness

it can be done.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 3, 1877.

  MY DEAR UNCLE:-We  have been in an agony of suspense

about our dear Mary for several days. After hoping against all









<B>400          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



reasonable probabilities, we are now compelled to yield to the

evidence and admit that she is among the unfortunate victims.

You have our deepest sympathy and prayers. We pray that you

and Aunt Birchard may have grace, under the merciful goodness

of God, to bear up, and to receive in full measure consolation

from the only Power that can sustain you in your great sorrow.

                         Affectionately,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE A. BIRCHARD,

      Fayetteville, Vermont.





  Columbus, January 5, 1877. -  My advices are that the result

of the action of the Senate will depend on the report the com-

mittee of the Senate makes on the election in Louisiana. This

seems not to be in much doubt, but there is enough to leave me

in a state of suspense.  I must, therefore, prepare for either

event. The Cabinet is the chief work. Next the inaugural. As

to the address, I wish to repeat my Letter of Acceptance (1) on

currency and national faith, (2) on civil service reform, (3)

on the South.  I must urge a liberal policy towards the South

especially in affording facilities for education and encouraging

business and emigration [immigration(?)] by internal improve-

ments of a national character.



Confidential.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 5, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have your note of the third. I do not wish

to influence the action of our friends, and do not volunteer

opinions.  But you have a right to my opinion.  I believe the

Vice-President alone has the constitutional power to count the

votes and declare the result. Everything in the nature of a con-

test as to electoral votes is an affair of the States. The rest is a

merely ministerial duty. Therefore, it is not right in my judg-

ment for Congress to interfere.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

a decided announcement of my own opinion as to the result

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                           COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 9, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -I am disappointed. I felt the incon-

gruity of the proposition,<B>+</B> and feared that I would wound a

friend by making it. But I saw great good in it, and ventured

to hope. You have no doubt done wisely. Do not allow it to

leave a shadow between us, if you can help it. I believed that I

could make it even with you before the year ended, or I would

not have thought of it.

  Mr. Horton's letter is very sound. I return it as you request.

  I am glad you gave your views of men. Do not hesitate to do

it in future.

  As to secretary, I must follow the traditions, I suppose. Your

views on the army would, of course, be useful to me. Among

the possibilities for you, that department was one of the promi-

nent ones.

  With kindest regards to Mrs. Force,

                            Sincerely,

                                                  R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE.



<FONT SIZE="-1">  *To this Mr. Sherman replied January 13:-"I had some conversation

with Morton as to your resignation and he expressed himself strongly

in favor of it at an early day. I think it better for you quietly to

hold on until near the time for counting the vote. At Columbus you are

accessible, and the strength of your position is in the dignified waiting for

results without unseemly anxiety and without suspicion of improper in-

fluence. I have mentioned the question to no one else and your good

judgment must settle it."</FONT>

  MY DEAR SIR:-I have your letter of the 18th. Your speech

was in all respects admirable. I read it in the Record and again

now.

  I shall be glad to leave the question of the resignation for

future decision. I can't suppose that the plan to cast lots for the

Presidency will be adopted. The country will condemn it un-

hesitatingly. I write in much haste.

                          Sincerely,

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



  Columbus, January 17, 1877.--Wheeler, Chandler (William

E.), and others write that Conkling is decidedly hostile, and that

he has enough followers to pass through the Senate a compromise

measure. The effect of this is to change the result, in all prob-

ability.

  Well, I am personally content. I must go on to the end, and in

the meanwhile prepare for either event. For the office, I must

have a private secretary and Cabinet, and [I must write] an

inaugural address.  My friend General Force is my preference

for private secretary. He declines, and almost feels hurt that

I suggested it to him. General Kennedy is my next choice.

  On the subject of Cabinet, I have talked with Mr. Wheeler,

General Cox, General Buckland, and a few others. I am inclined

to say that I must not take either of the leading competitors for

the Presidential nomination, nor any member of the present

Cabinet. My thoughts rest on Evarts for the first place. On

Governor Rice or Forbes, of Massachusetts, or Sherman for

[the] Treasury. On General Harlan, of Kentucky, for Attorney-

General. I think well of General Harrison, of Indiana, and

Settle, of North Carolina, for places. Governor Hartranft [of

Pennsylvania] has a Democratic lieutenant-governor, or he

might be favorably considered. McCrary, of Iowa, for a place.

Booth, of California, (but his seat in the Senate would be filled

by a Democrat).

Private.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 17, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:-I returned late last night, and found

here your letter. I have no time to reply suitably this morning,

but hasten to assure you that nobody is authorized to represent

me on the subject of the count. I have thought it fitting that I

should let that matter well alone. Of course, I have opinions.

But I shall abide the result. No one ought to go to war, or

even to law about it.

  I am free to say to you that I concur with Kent. But others,

abler to judge, think otherwise, and I recognize their right as

good Republicans so to think. Many good Republicans think

that the interests of the party will be promoted by Tilden's suc-

cess. I can see many reasons for this opinion. In the absence

of Congressional action, the Vice-President should count and

declare. I am not favorably impressed with leaving it to be de-

cided by lot. But I beg you to believe me sincere when I say

that I take no part in this, and shall quietly await the event.

  There is a contingency which I must be prepared for. I must

consider, if not write, an inaugural, and consider, if not appoint,

a Cabinet. On these points, I am glad to hear from all my

friends.

  I had a good talk with General Cox at Toledo Saturday.

Write often and fully.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 20, 1877.

  MY DEAR S-:-I return the letters as requested.

  As to the visits of friends, I like to see all, but I don't like to

request specially their presence. I would like to see you any

time, and I so say.

  I am not disturbed by recent events.

                           Sincerely,

<B>404          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



  Sunday, January 21.- The compromise report by the Joint

Committee seems to be a surrender, at least, in part, of our case.

The leading constitutional objection to it, perhaps, is that the

appointment of the Commission by act of Congress violates that

part of the Constitution which gives the appointment of all other

officers "to the President." To this it will possibly be replied

that the members of the Commission are not officers; that they

are analogous to referees and master commissioners, to advisory

boards, or committees. But is this true? Their decisions stand

unless both houses of Congress concur in overruling them. If

the Commission decides to throw out the vote of Mississippi, the

vote of that State will be lost if one house concurs. If the

Commission decides that Cronin's vote for Tilden shall be count-

ed, it will be counted if the House alone concurs.

  The Commission is analogous to inferior tribunals. Its de-

cisions are binding unless the superior tribunal overrules them

by a concurrent vote of both houses. The President of the Senate

and the Senate may be overruled by the Commission and the

House.

  Surely, the members of such a commission are officers. Their

appointment by Congress is a usurpation of the Presidential

authority. If the bill has not a two-thirds vote in both houses,

the President's veto ought to prevent it from becoming a law.

  The next most important objection to the bill is, that if passed

it may turn out to be an act to prevent the counting of the elec-

toral vote. There can be no count if the Commission refuses or

fails to act. This power to prevent a decision is a power far

above any power belonging to referees, master commissioners,

advisory boards, or committees.



  [The morning of the day on which the Joint Committee was to

introduce the Electoral Commission Bill, Mr. Sherman wrote:--

                     WASHINGTON, D. C., January 18, 1877.

  DEAR SIR:--Before you receive this you will have read the

plan the Joint Committee have reported to count the electoral

vote. I have just learnt from an authentic source the precise

terms of it and my judgment is against it.  It is a clumsily









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          405</B>



constructed machine to allow timid or treacherous men to de-

feat your election. The worst feature is the degradation of the

Supreme Court by picking out the strongest partisans on both

sides and requiring them to agree upon an umpire. In the

election of the Committee from the two houses the Democrats

have all advantage. They will select bitter partisans, while in

the Senate we cannot conceal that we are measurably in the

power of men who do not want your election declared. I cannot

be mistaken in attributing this hope to Conkling and others

whom I suspect but must not name. As to several Senators from

the South whom we feared, I am satisfied they will heartily sus-

tain your election.

  My inclination at this moment is at once to take decided and

earnest ground against this scheme as unconstitutional and im-

practicable - as a virtual surrender of your rights as President

elect of the United States. I believe the scheme can be defeated.

What will come after its defeat it is hard to tell; but our rejec-

tion of any plan proposed will be a point against us, unless we

can propose a better one.

  It has always seemed to me that a law providing for a summary

appeal on writ of error to the Supreme Court of [the] United

States from any decision of the President of the Senate is the

only constitutional solution of the difficulty. This could easily

be provided for if the House would agree, but we know it will

not. The same influence now rules the House and its galleries

that did in 1860-61, and I feel that we are to encounter the same

enemies that we did then.

  Don't consider yourself bound to answer this unless you have

some wish to express, as I write merely for your information.

                          Very truly yours,

  GOVERNOR R. B. HAYES,                       JOHN SHERMAN.

      Columbus.

  To this Mr. Hayes replied:-]

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 21, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I am exceedingly obliged for your attention.

Your views of the compromise are also mine. I prefer not to be









<B>406          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



quoted. I do not desire to influence the decision by Congress.

But the bill seems to me to be a very dangerous violation of the

Constitution. I agree with you also that the true appeal is to the

Supreme Court, according to the accustomed rules and principles

of law, by quo warranto or otherwise.  Mr. Little's letter to you

was written hastily. It may require revision. But in substance

it seems to me sound. I write this for your eye alone, believing

that you are entitled to my opinions.

  I do not wish them to be used to influence anybody.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 22, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:-Thanks for the letter on the War De-

partment. It ought to be well considered. There is important

matter in it.

  As to the compromise, I do not doubt the authority of Congress

to legislate on the count. But the legislation must itself be con-

stitutional. It should not establish a returning board. It should

not usurp the President's power to appoint "all other officers."

Are not the commissioners "officers"? Do they not form an

"inferior tribunal"? They are not merely in aid of Congress or

the Vice-President. If they decide, the decision stands unless

reversed by both houses.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE M. F. FORCE.



Private.

                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 23, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL:--No doubt the compromise will pass,

and I hope it will turn out well. I shall do nothing to influence

the result. The measure is, as you, say "extraconstitutional."

I am not disposed to look anxiously for constitutional objections

when an important good is to be accomplished. With me, the

chief objection is the usurpation of the Presidential power of

appointment which it involves. Congress, as my "Letter" inti-









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          407</B>



mates, has done this too much in the past. How you can get over

this, with your views, is one of the queries that puzzles me.

But "all's well that ends well" is, I suppose, the argument.

Nothing better has been published by the friends of the measure

than the enclosed.

  Now, for the other topics which interest me more particularly.

  Excuse haste and write often.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  Please return the printed slip.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.

                               COLUMBUS, January 23, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have your note of the 21st.  In reply, it is

my earnest desire that you should, from this time on, act on all

questions in my behalf, whenever it is lawful and proper for you

to do so, in connection with the Presidential contest.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE S. SHELLABARGER,

       Washington.

                               COLUMBUS, January 24, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - Your friend will have his commission.

  Assuming the passage of the bill, what next? Shall we have

argument? Who shall make it? Able and wise men should be

selected. Many of our friends at Washington are confident of

the result notwithstanding the obvious gain of our adversaries.

                           Sincerely,

  HONORABLE JOSEPH BARRETT,                       R. B. HAYES.

      Cincinnati.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 25, 1877.

  MY  DEAR  GENERAL:-I  have not replied before to your

esteemed favor of the 19th because I did not want to even seem

to wish to influence the action of Congress on the subject of the

count. Good Republicans differ as to the bill of the Conference

Committee. I see, or think I see, constitutional objections to it.









<B>408          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Certainly I prefer any plan which leaves the decision to the

Supreme Court. But now that it is before the country with many

Republicans committed to it, the question is a different one from

what it was when it was before the committee as an original

proposition.

  There ought to be full argument before the Commission. Argu-

ment on all questions -their powers, the true principles of the

Constitution, and the substantial equities. If this is not suffi-

ciently provided for, it is worthy of consideration whether

amendments should not be made to secure it. Do not under-

stand me as wishing to influence you for or against the bill.

I understand you are fully decided on your course.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE J. A. GARFIELD.

  [Mr. Garfield's letter follows:--

                            WASHINGTON, January 19, 1877.

  MY DEAR GOVERNOR:- I have no words strong enough to

describe my indignation at the fact and manner of the surrender

which the Senate has made of our position. The danger of

violent resistance to your inauguration had absolutely passed

away with the failure of the 8th [of] January conventions.

Nothing in the world was necessary but for the Senate to support

its presiding officer in following the early precedents which

were made under the fresh impulses of the Constitution then

recently adopted. A little bluster, a new burst of newspaper

wrath, and all would have been over. I don't believe one-half

of one per cent of our party had any doubt of the justice and es-

sential fairness of your election, and of the right of the President

of the Senate to declare it. And now those Republicans who

have borne the brunt of the campaign, and of the struggle against

fraud and violence since the election, see the certainty of an as-

sured result traded off for the uncertain chances of what a com-

mittee of one majority will do; and the Senators who have made

this surrender are those who did the least toward securing our

victory. Our friends in the House side of the committee would

never have agreed to the bill but from the conviction that enough









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          409</B>



Republican Senators would follow Conkling to leave Ferry

 [President of the Senate] without support. Probably the mis-

chief is irreparable. A compromise like this is singularly attrac-

tive to that class of men who think that the truth is always

halfway between God and the Devil, and that not to split the

difference would be partisanship. Pardon my scolding; for I sat

down to ask your opinion.

  While the bill surrenders a great advantage it does not neces-

sarily defeat us.  Probably it leaves us an even chance-pos-

sibly more than even. The Republican members of the committee

are confident that you will be declared elected under the bill.

The worst that the four judges can do is to choose Davis as the

fifth wheel to this compromise coach. If they fail to agree upon

a choice, they must cast lots and that would give us three chances

out of four-with Davis as the fourth.  My present inclination

is to fight the bill from beginning to end, and wash my hands

of all responsibility for its result. I shall certainly do so if I find

any hope of defeating it.

  But the present outlook is that it will pass by a very large

majority. Those of our friends who favor the bill are anxious

to have me on the Commission and for that reason are urging

me not to oppose it. I understand that the Democrats and Re-

publicans on the committee have personally pledged each other

that each party may name its own committeemen. I wish you

would write me at once, what seems best to be done under the

circumstances. Do you see any changes that ought to [be] at-

tempted in the bill before it comes to a final vote?

                         As ever yours,

                                             J. A. GARFIELD.]

  GOVERNOR R. B. HAYES,

      Columbus.



  Friday, January 26, 1877. - The compromise bill for counting

the Presidential vote passed the Senate by forty-seven to seven-

teen. More Republicans supported it than voted against it. The

Democrats all voted aye except Eaton, of Connecticut. Its pas-

sage by a like majority in the House is probable. What Con-

gress and the popular sentiment approve is rarely defeated by









<B>410          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



reason of constitutional objections. I trust the measure will turn

out well. It is a great relief to me. Defeat in this way, after a

full and public hearing before this Commission, is not mortifying

in any degree, and success will be in all respects more satis-

factory.

  I have not tried to influence the opinions or actions of anybody

on the bill. Before another Presidential election, this whole sub-

ject of the Presidential election ought to be thoroughly considered,

and a radical change made. It is probable that no wise measure

can be devised which does not require an amendment of the

Constitution. Let proposed amendments be maturely considered.

Something ought to be done immediately.





                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 26, 1877.

  MY DEAR JUDGE: - I am obliged for your valued letter. The

bill in relation to the election will become a law. Of course, with

so strong a vote in its favor, the President will promptly sign it.

I have not attempted to influence the result, and shall not. If

the principles of Mr. Frelinghuysen's speech are adopted by the

Commission, our success is almost certain. I take it our friends

will see that we are ably and wisely represented both on and

before the Commission. This is the next point of interest.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE A. TAFT,

      ATTORNEY-GENERAL.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, January 29, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have yours of the 25th and assure you that

I am very much gratified by it. After twice reading, I think I can

vote aye to every idea in it. Let me hastily add two or three

suggestions:

  To bring the South to a better condition, I feel like saying that

the Nation will aid the people of that section, (1) to the means

of education, (2) to internal improvements of a national char-

acter. Again, may I not properly propose an amendment to the









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          411</B>



Constitution, making the Presidential term six years and no

reelection ?

  Of course, I see the great uncertainty of the result of the con-

test. But I prefer to be ready as far as may be. If my paper is

not used the loss will not be great. I want also to be ready to

make a Cabinet -remaining to the last free to choose as may

at the time seem advisable. On the whole business, I shall be

glad to hear from you.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE CARL SCHURZ.



  Columbus, January 31, 1877. -The Commission seems to be

a good one. At 2 P. M. Webb announced, "The judge - it is

Bradley. In Washington the bets are five to one that the next

[President] will be Hayes."

  But I am in no way elated. I prefer success. But I am clear

that for our happiness failure is to be preferred. I shall, there-

fore, await the event with the utmost composure. If the result

is adverse, I shall be cheerful, quiet, and serene. If successful,

may God give me grace to be firm and wise and just -clear in

the great office - for the true interest of all the people of the

United States!



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 1, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have your letter. The appointment of Gen-

eral Wikoff [as pension agent] is well received.       It was the

best possible solution of the difficulty.

  I am sure that our friends have done well thus far in the

election contest. No doubt, all will be done that can be. Per-

haps it would be well to show the equity of our claim to Louis-

iana by a presentation of the figures in 1874 and 1876. The

Democrats, by reason of five of our electors being left off in

some parishes, show on the face of the returns a larger majority

than they are equitably entitled to. The true test is the highest

candidates for elector. This shows, according to the Democratic

count on the face of the returns, six thousand five hundred ma-









<B>412          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



jority for Tilden. They constantly state it at eight thousand or

ten thousand. But all this you understand, and how the violence

gained them over eight thousand five hundred votes in the five

well-known parishes alone, whereas the Republicans gained in

the rest of the State a few votes, even if we say nothing of our

losses in other sections.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 2, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - Thanks for your valuable letter. What-

ever occurs to you on the following names will be confidentially

treated.

  Forbes and Rice, of Boston,

  Frelinghuysen, New Jersey,

  Settle, North Carolina,

  Harlan, Kentucky,

  Sherman, Ohio,

  Booth, California,

  Alcorn, Mississippi,

  McCrary, Iowa,

  Who  from Pennsylvania besides Grow?        And how  stands

Grow in that State?

  Morrill, of Vermont.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 4, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have your note of the first. It impresses

me strongly. My anxiety to do something to promote the pacifi-

cation of the South is perhaps in danger of leading me too far.

I do not reflect on the use of the military power in the past.

But there is to be an end of all that, except in emergencies which

I can't think of as possible again. We must do all we can to

promote prosperity there. Education, emigration and immigra-









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          413</B>



tion, improvements occur to me. But the more I think of it, the

more I see in what you say. We must go cautiously and slowly.

  The result of the great lawsuit will, perhaps, relieve me from

all responsibility. I am, fortunately, not anxious to assume it.

If it comes I want to be ready. You will see, from what I write

you, that the South is more on my mind than anything else.

Perhaps we must be content to leave that to time - taking care

not to obstruct time's healing processess by injudicious meddling.

I will think of it. Thanks.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 4, 1877.

  MY DEAR MRS. DAVIS: - We are to come down in case a

meeting is held for the Children's Home in which Mr. Shipley

is interested. Will it be perfectly convenient for you if we light

down on you with traps, etc.? We are invited to Mr. S-'s, but,

etc., etc.

  Our regards to the doctor. -We may be decided out before

coming, and I know it will be a trial to you to have on your

hands a broken-down old politician, but it will test and prove

your goodness.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S. -  Lucy has little faith -weaker than a grain of mustard

seed - in these "mixed commissions" and things.

  MRS. DR. JOHN DAVIS,

       Cincinnati.



  Columbus, February 8, 1877. -Yesterday the Electoral Com-

mission decided not to go behind the papers filed with the Vice-

President in the case of Florida. The question was well argued

on our side. Judge Matthews was notably able and successful.

Mr. Evarts' argument was worthy of his fame. I read the

arguments in the Congressional Record and can't see how lawyers

can differ on the question. But the decision is by a strictly party









<B>414          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



vote--eight Republicans against seven Democrats! It shows

the strength of party ties. The general situation is now regarded

as much more favorable to us, and now our friends are very

confident of success.



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 8, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR:- Congratulations on your success so far.  It

seems to me important that our equitable rights should be as-

serted in the future cases as it was by Mr. Evarts and Judge

Matthews in the case of Florida. Perhaps this scrap will aid

you in doing it for Louisiana.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

MR. S. SHELLABARGER.



  February 9. - The reception to the Sixty-second General As-

sembly at the City Hall last night was very well attended and an

enjoyable affair.

  I here from  -    of Steubenville that Eli T. Sheppard, being

unwell, kept his bed in a hotel in Washington while Jere. Black

discussed with his callers, in a room separated from that of

Sheppard by a door, [and overheard] the loud talk in Black's

room on the situation. Black said: "God damn them, they will

beat us and elect Hayes, but we shall give them all the trouble

we can !"

  I am not likely to get much time to prepare an inaugural ad-

dress after the Commission decides in my favor, if it does so

decide. I would like to get clearly in view the main points.

Refer to the pacific solution of the disputed Presidential contest;

to the necessity of peaceful relations with all nations, and an

allusion to arbitration as a means of averting war--this, with

a complimentary allusion to General Grant; the return to specie

payments; the permanency of civil service tenures, purity, ap-

pointments for merit, etc., etc. The South to be made prosperous

by a cheerful acquiescence in the results of the war, by peace,

by education, by improvements. Profess a desire to so appoint

as to aid in good local government.









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          415</B>



  We expect to go tomorrow to Cincinnati. Saturday evening,

at the Bar Association supper, I will give, if called on, [a toast

to the] memory of Gholson, Spencer, and Storer, the judges

elected in 1854-the best bench I ever saw.





                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 10, 1877.

  DEAR DOCTOR: -We go to Cincinnati today to remain at Dr.

Davis' until Wednesday next. If the Commission goes on in

this style we must begin to think of our plans. Perhaps I may

want to stay at Fremont a week or ten days before we go East.

If so, we will be overrun with callers, annoying to you, and

ought perhaps for a few days to be in possession and control. If

we go we shall have a special car from Fremont and will take a

few friends, among them you and Annie.  So arrange - if and if.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  DR. J. T. WEBB,

       Fremont.



Private.

                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 15, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - I have two letters from you since I last wrote.

If it becomes my duty to make a Cabinet, I want your views fully

and specifically. If possible a personal interview would be ex-

tremely desirable.

   Boynton writes to Smith that an assurance that my views on

 the Southern question are truly set forth in my Letter with such

 additions as I could properly make, would be useful. I prefer to

make no new declarations. But you may say, if you deem it

advisable, that you know that I will stand by the friendly and

encouraging words of that Letter, and by all that they imply.

 You can not express that too strongly.

                            Sincerely,

                                                 R. B. HAYES.

   HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 15, 1877.

  MY DEAR S-: - The papers I return for your keeping.

  We are waiting still for the verdict. The prospects seem bet-

ter, but -

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  WILLIAM HENRY SMITH.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 16, 1877.

  MY  DEAR R-:--Before this reaches you, the result in

Louisiana will be known. It is not unlikely that early next week

will decide. I have written you that I would like to find a place

that would suit you near me in Washington, if I am to go. It

would be most agreeable if you and Mrs. Rogers could go with

us, if we are to go. What place you would like best, I can't

tell. We can leave that for future decision, if you think you

can come. If you come down and go on, I will pay your ex-

penses. I want to go to Fremont, if there is time, and start

from there. Can't you come instantly on hearing a favorable

result.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  W. K. ROGERS.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 16, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR:--If the issue of the contest is in our favor, I

shall want to see you at once if it is at all practicable. Don't

you want to visit Mansfield? I can meet you there or here--

or, possibly, at a point east of there.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.





  February 17.-Last evening Louisiana was decided by the

Commission in our favor. There is still some doubt, but appar-

ently very little, of the result. The inaugural and Cabinet-mak-

ing are now in order. I would like to get support from good









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          417</B>



men of the South, late Rebels. How to do it is the question.

I have the best disposition towards the Southern people, Rebels

and all. I could appoint a Southern Democrat in the Cabinet.

But who would take it among the capable and influential good

men of those States? General Joseph E. Johnston occurs to me.

I must think of this.



                         COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 17, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - I am sorry I can't go down to Cincin-

nati next Saturday to visit my namesake in Lawrenceburg, and

be of the party to visit the mounds. But you see how it is.

   I note what you say on the silver question. It is interesting.

I am a pupil on all that great topic.

                           Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL M. F. FORCE,

       Cincinnati.



  February 18.  Sunday.- The indications still are that I am to

go to Washington. I talked yesterday with Fred Douglass and

Mr. Poindexter, both colored, on the Southern question. I told

them my views. They approved. Mr. Douglass gave me many

useful hints about the whole subject. My course is a firm as-

sertion and maintenance of the rights of the colored people of

the South according to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth

Amendments, coupled with a readiness to recognize all Southern

people, without regard to past political conduct, who will now go

with me heartily and in good faith in support of these principles.





                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 18, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: - We have the result of the Democratic caucus.

The affair now looks extremely well.

  I suppose Judge Matthews will come home on the completion

of the Oregon case. If so, I wish him to let me know as to his

coming by dispatch, that I may see him here without fail. This,

on the assumption that we have succeeded. Will you please

    27









<B>418          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



let him know, as I am not sure of his address. You and the

judge have made Ohio very proud of you. You have gained

great reputation.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE S. SHELLABRGER.



                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 18, 1877.

  MY DEAR H-: - I have read with much interest Mr. Medill's

letter. He would make a very sensible President. My only sur-

prise and mortification is that he has not yet found me out.

I thought I had been pretty well advertised. I must forgive men

east of the Hudson for thinking me a spooney after this.

Strange, after the figure Ohio made before, and in the Com-

mission, that friend Medill should ask, "What will be his South-

ern policy?" My paragraph was short but his eighteen pages

have not added an idea to it.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  MURAT HALSTEAD,

      Cincinnati.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 18, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR:--I do not see how I can get ready to leave

for Washington in less than a week after I resign as governor.

I will, however, heed the advice of my friends and do what I

can to be there some days, perhaps a week, before the inaugura-

tion. Of course, I will not resign until the result is known.

  I am afraid I cannot arrange my large flock unless I go to a

hotel with them.  But if I come with Mrs. Hayes alone I will,

if it is perfectly convenient, prefer to stay with you. I will write

you again soon. You will see by the above I prefer not to come

until the result is declared, and time enough elapses to fix up here.

But I must do what is best, and will listen to you.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          419</B>



  February 19. -For Cabinet:

  1.  A new Cabinet-no member of the present.

  2. No Presidential candidates.

  3. No appointment to "take care" of anybody.



Confidential.

                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 19, 1877.

  MY DEAR SIR: -The more I think of it, the more difficult it

seems for me to get ready to come to Washington before Wednes-

day or Thursday of next week. I must fix affairs at Fremont

and can't begin it until I know the result. Why can't friends

be sent or come here?

  It seems to me proper now to say that I am extremely desirous

that you should take the Treasury Department. Aside from my

own personal preference, there are many and controlling reasons

why I should ask you to do this. It will satisfy friends here in

Ohio. I understand Governor Morton and our friends in Wash-

ington like it. The country will approve it. You are by all

odds the best fitted for it of any man in the nation. Your resig-

nation from the Senate will be a great loss to that body, but it

will cause no serious dissensions or difficulty in Ohio. Do not

say no until I have had a full conference with you.

  There is no reason why you should not visit Ohio as soon as

you can be spared from Washington. Of course, the public will

know of our meeting. But they will be gratified to know it.

No possible harm can come of it. I should have said all this

before, but I did not want to embarrass you in your action on

the Presidential question.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  HONORABLE JOHN SHERMAN.



                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 23, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - I am in receipt of your very kind note

of the 20th. Sinister rumors from Washington leave us in

doubt as to the final issue. In case of success, I expect to be in

Washington next Thursday, 29th, and to go directly to Senator









<B>420          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



Sherman's. If, after seeing you, it seems best, I will be glad to

accept your hospitality on Saturday for myself and family. I

will also be pleased to dine with you as proposed on that day.

I cannot name all or perhaps any of my party except my own

family, but I suppose that besides Mrs. Hayes and myself and

son, Webb C., there will also be General and Mrs. Mitchell, and

possibly four others. If you wish to invite others, may I sug-

gest Mr. Wheeler and Senator and Mrs. Sherman?

  I noticed an item saying that you would, on leaving the Execu-

tive Mansion, go to Mr. Fish's.  I will be particularly gratified

if you will remain where you are as long as it may be convenient

for you to do so, and until your own residence is ready.

  Mrs. Hayes is now absent, but you may assure Mrs. Grant

that my wife will feel obliged to her if she will remain at least

a few days with us after the 5th of March.

  As to my family coming to your house on Saturday,- it oc-

curs to me that with your dinner, etc., etc., this may be incon-

venient and that it is best for me to remain at Senator Sherman's

until after inauguration.

  All this, on the supposition that we are finally declared suc-

cessful.                  Sincerely,

                                                R. B. HAYES.

  P. S.--It is perhaps best that the date of my expected ar-

rival in Washington should not be made public.

  GENERAL U. S. GRANT,

       PRESIDENT.



  February 25. - Yesterday the Commission decided Oregon to

be for Hayes and Wheeler. This is the last of the disputed and

doubtful States. The only apparent chance of defeating us now

is the revolutionary conduct of the Democrats in the House. The

Southern members of that party, who have hitherto been con-

servative and favorable, are disturbed by an article in the Ohio

State Journal unfriendly to them, which is charged to have been

inspired by me. The truth is I stand on my Letter. If I speak

at Fremont or elsewhere during the next few days, I may say:









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          421</B>



  "My Letter [of Acceptance in July last] expressed what I

thought were just sentiments on the leading questions which then

interested the country. I thought its doctrines were sound be-

fore the election. I think they are sound now that the election

is over. And if the issue pending in Congress shall be decided

in our favor, those principles will be the standard by which my

official conduct shall be guided. If I were to write that letter

now, I would give that part on the Southern question greater

emphasis. The great body of the people of this country earn-

estly desire a wise and just settlement of that question. They

want peace, they long for repose.

  "What is required is: First, that for the protection and welfare

of the colored people, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth

Amendments shall be sacredly observed and faithfully enforced

according to their true intent and meaning.

  "Second, We all see that the tremendous revolution which

has passed over the Southern people has left them impoverished

and prostrate, and we all are deeply solicitous to do what may

constitutionally be done to make them again prosperous and

happy. They need economy, honesty, and intelligence in their

local governments. They need to have such a policy adopted as

will cause sectionalism to disappear, and that will tend to wipe

out the color line. They need to have encouraged immigration,

education, and every description of legitimate business and in-

dustry. We do not want a united North nor a united South. We

want a united country. And if the great trust shall devolve upon

me, I fervently pray that the Divine Being, who holds the des-

tinies of the nations in His hands, will give me wisdom to per-

form its duties so as to promote the truest and best interests

of the whole country."<B>*</B>



                        COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 25, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: -I am just about to start for Fremont

to stay over Sunday. I write hastily to return the enclosed

letters and to say a few words. I do not, or have not, desired

to be committed on Cabinet appointments until the issue was

<B>422          RUTHERFORD BIRCHARD HAYES</B>



reached. But it is, perhaps, proper to say that, if elected, it has

 for a long time. been my wish to invite you to take a place in

the Cabinet. I think it would be fortunate for the country, and

especially so for myself, if you are one of the members of the

Cabinet. I am not likely to change that opinion. The Interior

Department is my preference for you. The Post-office would

come next. For State I hope to have Mr. Evarts, but have not

consulted him. Mr. Sherman will probably take the Treasury.

  If nothing occurs to change my plans, I expect to go to Wash-

ington about Thursday next. All this is on the supposition that

we are successful and is to be strictly confidential.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.

  GENERAL C. SCHURZ.



  Fremont, February 26, 1877. -Why not adopt provisionally

a rule that no application for office will be considered at present ?

Papers will be filed with the proper officer, or in the proper

department. Hereafter rules will be adopted and made public.

Personal applications to the President will in no case be favorably

considered.

  CoLumbus,  February  27.-Mark Twain recommends  Lieu-

tenant-Colonel Richard Irwin Dodge, author of the "Great

Plains," etc., for the head of the Indian Department. "Knowl-

edge of Indians and humanity."





                       COLUMBUS, OHIO, February 27, 1877.

  MY DEAR GENERAL: - I am very glad to get your note of yes-

terday. Your choice of Department is also my choice for you.

I should be delighted to have you go with us to Washington

if we are declared elected before we start. But I do not want

my selection of Cabinet advisers known until that result is an-

nounced. I will dispatch you as to train. In case of a favorable

decision Wednesday, we start about noon Thursday. If no

favorable decision is reached Wednesday, we do not start until









             <B>THE DISPUTED ELECTION          423</B>



in the night of Thursday. My idea is to leave undecided, or

rather uncommitted, some places until I reach Washington.

Say War, Navy, and Postmaster-General.

  I write in the midst of interruptions- provokingly so.

                          Sincerely,

                                              R. B. HAYES.
