The 3000 pages of the bookswere scanned by the staff of the State Archives .  The scanned images were runthrough an optical character recognition program Prime Recognition.  The web pagewas then designed by Gilbert Gonzalez of the Hayes Center staff and mounted jointlyon the Hayes and Ohio Historical Society web pages.</P><P>The project was financially supported by the Hayes Presidential CenterBoard of Trustees Fund and the Ohio Historical Foundation.</P><P>Special thanks go to all the people at the Hayes Presidential Centerwho made this project possible:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><!-- Removing titles from people accredited - 06/27/12<P>Roger D.
